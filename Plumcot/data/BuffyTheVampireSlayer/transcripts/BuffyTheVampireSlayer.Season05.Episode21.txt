glory So it's her. Under our noses all this time.
slook Glorificus will find the witch.
anya Witch?
willow_rosenberg Tara.
glory You're not the key, you're nothing!
willow_rosenberg No!
willow_rosenberg Tara!
buffy_summers I'm so sorry.
tara_maclay They kill mice.
ben Not if I get the key first.
gronx Could you do it? Take a human life with your own hands?
glory I told you this wasn't over.
tara_maclay Such pure green energy!
glory The key!
buffy_summers Just pack up whatever supplies we need and that's it, we're gone.
buffy_summers Giles!
rupert_giles I see them.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
buffy_summers How is he? Will?
ben I think I got him stabilized, but there's a lot of damage. We need to get him out of here.
xander_harris We got company!
general_gregor The key.
general_gregor Once the key is activated, the walls separating reality will crumble. Dimensions will bleed into each other.
buffy_summers I won't let anything happen to you.
ben Let me out!
buffy_summers Will, open a door!
ben No!
dawn_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers Dawn!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, you have to get up! Buffy, please! Buffy!
murk Quickly, quickly! Already we're behind schedule! Someone's bound for a beheading.
murk Let's make sure it's not me.
gronx Why do we remain when our moment of triumph lies so close at hand?
murk The glorious one, having acquired much in this world, doesn't exactly travel light.
glory Hey! Minions, I can hear you. God-like ears don't miss much, you know what I'm sayin'? Come here.
gronx 'Twas he who blasphemed, your magnificence.
murk Spurred on by treacherous urging!
glory Guys! I'm not gonna kill you. Not in the mood. What do you think that's about?
gronx In mercy does your power lie?
glory No, brainless, in torture, death and chaos does my power lie. So tell me, why am I not popping your head like a zit right now?
glory Maybe I'm just hungry.
murk Yes, we shall fetch a, a lovely-
glory No, I'm not hungry.
glory Uhh! Just a little tight in the skin is all. I've been waiting an eternity - well, 25 human years - and it all comes down to tonight.
gronx The portal shall open.
murk And the great Glorificus shall return.
glory To the hell I came from. Where I'm gonna rain down more super-sized portions of slaughter, mayhem and bloodshed than any of you scabs can even dream about. So how come I ain't happy? Got everything I ever wanted ... still, something's off.
glory I don't know. What do you think?
spike Better part of a century spent in delinquency just paid off. Hotwired Ben's auto. Who's for gettin' the hell out of here?
xander_harris All in favor, let's do it. You good to go?
rupert_giles Oh, don't worry about me. How's Buffy?
xander_harris The same. Still.
willow_rosenberg It's been almost a half an hour.
spike The Slayer's gonna be all right, won't she?
xander_harris You should try it again, Will.
willow_rosenberg All right, but ... I'm not even sure she's, you know ... really in there.
xander_harris Try.
willow_rosenberg Can you hear me? Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
spike Buffy!
spike She can't just be brain-dead. I mean ... she's still Buffy, somewhere in there, right?
xander_harris Spike, come on, we're not gonna get Dawn back by sittin' around here.
spike You're not gonna get Dawn back any way you slice it, Harris, it's for Buffy to decide.
xander_harris Good, panic. That oughta help.
willow_rosenberg We should move her. U-unless we shouldn't. Should we?
anya Couldn't that make it worse? I think I read that somewhere.
xander_harris I am so large with not knowing.
rupert_giles It's impossible to know for sure. Losing Dawn, after all that Buffy's been through ... I think it's pushed her too far into some sort of catatonia.
spike You don't need a diploma to see that. Snap her out of it.
spike Buffy!
spike Oi, rise and shine, love!
anya Spike...
spike Come on, people. Girl's endowed with Slayer strength. It's hardly the time to get dainty. Buffy!
xander_harris We tried that!
spike Ow!
anya We didn't try that.
xander_harris Are you insane? We could be dealing with neurological damage here. You want to kill her?
spike We have to do something. I can't just sit here watching. You waste time with kid gloves. I'm willing to wager, when all is said and done, Buffy likes it rough.
willow_rosenberg Separate.
willow_rosenberg Buffy's out. Glory has Dawn. Sometime real soon, she's gonna use Dawn to tear down the barrier between every dimension there is. So if you two wanna fight, do it after the world ends, okay?
willow_rosenberg All right. First we head back to Sunnydale. Xander'll take Giles to a hospital. Anya's looking after Tara. And Spike, you find Glory. Check her apartment, see if she's still there. Try anything stupid, like payback, and I will get Very Cranky. Everyone clear?
willow_rosenberg Anya.
anya Um ... w-what will you do?
willow_rosenberg I'll help Buffy.
anya Okay then.
tara_maclay The world is spinning.
tara_maclay Straight to a new day! Big day. Big, big day.
willow_rosenberg Shh, shh.
spike Uh ... Will?
spike Now, uh, don't turn me into a horned toad for asking, but ... what if we come across Ben?
willow_rosenberg I-I don't think a doctor's what Buffy needs right now.
spike Well, yeah, especially not one who also happens to be Glory.
rupert_giles What do you mean?
spike You know. Ben is Glory.
willow_rosenberg You mean ... Ben's with Glory?
xander_harris With in what sense?
anya They're working together?
spike No. No. Ben is Glory. Glory's Ben. They're one and the same.
anya When did all this happen?
spike Not one hour ago! Right here, before your very eyes! Ben came, he turned into Glory, snatched the kid, and pfft! Vanished, remember?
spike You do remember...? Is everyone here very stoned?
spike Ben! Glory! He's a doctor, she's the beast. Two entirely separate entities sharing one body. Like a bloody sitcom. Surely you remember.
xander_harris So you're saying ... Ben and Glory...
anya Have a connection.
rupert_giles Yes, obviously, but what kind?
spike Oh, I get it. That's very crafty. Glory's worked the kind of mojo where anyone who sees her little presto-change-o instantly forgets. And yours truly, being somewhat other than human ... stands immune.
willow_rosenberg So ... Ben and Glory ... are-are the same person?
xander_harris Glory can turn into Ben, and Ben turns back into Glory.
anya And anyone who sees it instantly forgets.
spike Kewpie doll for the lady.
rupert_giles Excellent. Now. Do we suspect there may be some kind of connection between Ben and Glory?
crazy_1 The key. The key.
CRAZIES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 The key. The key. The key.
glory Unbelievable how annoying those groupies can be.
murk Uh, they merely sense that tonight at last, the dimensional portal shall open.
gronx Ushering in the long and bloody reign of the great...
glory What's he doing?
PRIEST#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 I must anoint the key.
glory Really don't. Go.
PRIEST#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 But-
glory Out! Get out, get out!
glory You know ... you recapture your godhood and unleash Armageddon... all of a sudden everybody wants to be a part of the inner circle.
glory You okay?
dawn_summers I wanna go home.
glory Sweetie ... ohh...
glory You're about to.
glory Not that fake suburban nightmare the monks cooked up for you. I mean your real home. As the key! You fit the lock. Well, it's like a lock. Hey! You want a pizza?
dawn_summers No.
glory Pillow? I don't know if this thing gets cable. Doubtful.
dawn_summers Please. Stop.
glory You nervous?
dawn_summers Yes.
glory I know how you feel. It is your last night.
glory As, you know ... a human. This body ... it's just a rental, Dawnie. Being human? It's like a costume for girls like you and me. Being something else, *that's* what we are.
dawn_summers Don't.
glory What?
dawn_summers Don't call me Dawnie.
glory Huh. Wow. You know, that actually hurt my feelings.
dawn_summers I'm sorry.
glory Not the point.
glory I'm just thinking, here I am trying to make you feel better, when comforting others ... not part of my life. And I'm doing it, so I can stop ... feeling so ... um ...
glory Help me out.
dawn_summers Guilty?
glory Guilty. That's it! But I'm not supposed to feel guilty. I'm not supposed to feel anything. I'm, I'm ... I'm a god. I'm above it. I'm ... You.
glory You did this to me, didn't you? Some sort of spell, you've been hanging with the wicca, you could've- But no. It's not magic. It's something else. Still, it is you doing this.
dawn_summers I ... I'm not doing anything. I swear.
glory We'll see.
glory Anoint this thing now!
glory Know what they're all chanting for out there, Dawnie? Blood. 'Cause we found out your blood is the key to the key! All I gotta do is bleed you dry, the portal opens up, and I can go home! So knock yourself out, girlfriend. Make me feel bad as you can.
glory 'Cause tomorrow ... you bleed, little girl.
anya You sure you know what you're doing?
willow_rosenberg I think so. I don't know. It's ... not exactly well-explored territory, but ... I gotta try.
anya A spell like this could be really dangerous for Buffy. And you.
tara_maclay Time ... oh, time is coming.
willow_rosenberg Shh. It's okay. I'm here.
willow_rosenberg You'll look after her while I'm...
anya Sure. What do I do?
willow_rosenberg Mostly ... just ... be here for her. And, and there's some pills in my knapsack. Half of one every two hours keeps her ... pretty mellow.
anya Y-you think you'll be gone more than two hours?
willow_rosenberg Wish me luck.
anya Okay.
anya Good luck!
willow_rosenberg Thanks. Okay. Be good now, sweetie. I-I'll be back as soon as I can, okay? We're good?
anya Good luck.
VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 Hi, Willow.
willow_rosenberg Hello, Buffy.
young_buffy What are you doing here?
willow_rosenberg Actually, I'm, uh...
willow_rosenberg ...looking for you.
young_buffy Do you like dolls?
willow_rosenberg Buffy ... what are you doing here?
young_buffy I like it here.
willow_rosenberg But ... You know we need you. You have to come out.
young_buffy Why?
willow_rosenberg To be with your friends.
young_buffy It's a big day for me.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 Hello!
young_buffy Mommy, Daddy!
young_buffy You're back! You're back!
joyce_summers Hello, Buffy.
hank_summers How's my girl?
joyce_summers Are you ready to meet your new baby sister?
hank_summers Oh, come on now, Buffy. She's nothing to be afraid of.
young_buffy Who's afraid?
joyce_summers Don't you want to be the big sister?
young_buffy No, I want to be the baby.
hank_summers Buffy.
young_buffy You're gonna pay more attention to her and forget all about me!
joyce_summers Ohh...
young_buffy Doesn't she look funny? Like a wrinkly old grandpa.
joyce_summers Like this ... okay, support the head ... there you go! We're calling her Dawn.
willow_rosenberg Dawn.
young_buffy I ... I could be the one to look after her sometimes ... if you need a helper. Mom? Can I take care of her?
joyce_summers Yes, Buffy, you can take care of her.
willow_rosenberg Ohh...kay.
rupert_giles Uh, can you, uh...
xander_harris There. How you doing?
rupert_giles It only hurts while I answer pointless questions. Where's Buffy?
xander_harris Willow's on it. Or ... in it. She's workin' some spell, trying to reach Buffy psychically.
rupert_giles Uh, she's gone into Buffy's mind?
xander_harris Pretty tricky stuff.
rupert_giles It's extraordinarily advanced. Um, I was thinking we should check on Glory's victims while ... we're here.
xander_harris Oh, the mental ward? I already been. The vegetable section's closed. Nobody there. It's like they all just got up and walked away.
spike Checked out Glory's flat. Looks like the great one has scampered.
rupert_giles Gone to, uh, perform her ritual with Dawn and leaving us entirely clueless.
spike Not entirely. I know this bloke. Well, not so much a bloke so much as a demon. But still, bookish. All tuned in to the nastier corners of this our magic world. It's a bit of a last resort really, but still, we might persuade him to suss out Glory's game plan.
spike Sound worthy?
spike Off we go then. Meet back at the shop.
spike Found Ben's room at Glory's. Didn't learn much.
xander_harris Wait, wait, wait. Ben? At Glory's? You're saying all this time he's been subletting from her?
spike This ... is gonna be worth it.
spike@xander_harris Ow!!
spike Last time. From the top.
glory I'm hating this, Murk.
gronx And this would be what exactly, your holiness?
glory Memories. I'm starting to remember the things Ben did. People he spoke with, stuff he wore... Hmm! Kid!
glory I came ... he came to see you, didn't he?
dawn_summers Ben?
glory Yeah, Ben. You called him to the desert when you were hiding from me. And he came. And then he was me, you remember?
dawn_summers Yes.
glory See? She's not supposed to remember that! Nobody should! The cloak between Ben and me is fading! I almost helped her! He ... I wanted to. I can't do this!
glory Get him out of me.
PRIEST#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 What?
glory Ben! The human meat-sack who's infecting me. Do your mojo, make an incision, or removal, or whatever you've gotta do. Help me! I'm ... I'm thinking Ben's thoughts, and ... and I'm feeling his feelings! And ... uh! I...
ben ...can't kill the girl.
glory Damn it.
glory Help me!
PRIEST#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 Th-this I cannot do. You risk terrible magicks in opening the portal. Nothing comes without a price. This ... is yours.
glory Gods don't pay.
glory We do this *now*!
willow_rosenberg Hey ... I know you. You're, you're the first original Slayer who tried killing us all in our dreams.
willow_rosenberg How've you been?
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 Death is your gift.
buffy_summers Death is my gift?
willow_rosenberg Wait, death is her what?
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 Death is your gift.
willow_rosenberg Where are you going?
murk Glorificus, wait! Kill the key now and all will be lost!
gronx We'll be stuck on this mortal plane forever!
glory All right, you're right. It's cool. I'm just a little emotional right now... which, if you're into irony, funny.
glory Leave. We need a little girl time.
glory Goodbye!
glory How do they do it?
dawn_summers Do what?
glory People! How do they function here like this in the world with all this bile running through them? Every day it's whoo-oo You have no control. They're not even animals, they're just these meatbaggy slaves to, to hormones and pheromones and their, and their feelings. Hate 'em!
glory I mean really. Is this what the poets go on about, this? Call me crazy, but as hard-core drugs go, human emotion is just useless! People are puppets! Everyone getting jerked around by what they're feelin'. Am I wrong? Really, I want to know.
glory Gonna bleed you either way.
dawn_summers Depends on the person.
glory So you're saying some people like this.
dawn_summers Some.
glory Funny. 'Cause I look around at this world you're so eager to be a part of ... and all I see is six billion lunatics looking for the fastest ride out. Who's not crazy? Look around. Everyone's drinking, smoking, shooting up ... shooting each other, or just plain screwing their brains out 'cause they don't want 'em anymore. *I'm* crazy? Honey, I'm the original one-eyed chicklet in the kingdom of the blind. 'Cause at least I admit the world makes me nuts.
glory Name one person who can take it here. That's all I'm asking. Name one.
dawn_summers Buffy.
willow_rosenberg I can't keep following you around like this, Buffy. We have to go.
willow_rosenberg You have to talk to...
willow_rosenberg ...me.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry.
buffy_summers Don't be. Death is my gift.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I keep hearing that, but... I'm not exactly sure what it means.
buffy_summers It's really not that complicated.
willow_rosenberg Not for you maybe.
buffy_summers It's what I do.
buffy_summers I mean, come on, you've known me ... for how long? It's what I'm here for. It's all I am.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, stop! No!
willow_rosenberg God, no!
buffy_summers What? I keep telling you, Will. I-I figured it out. Death is my gift.
glory Oh, Ben. This is really not a good time.
ben Dawn. Has Glory hurt you?
dawn_summers Uh ... no. Not yet.
dawn_summers But I have to get out of here. Ben? You okay?
ben Where is it?
dawn_summers W-where's what?
ben All the blood. I can feel it ... still warm and ... wet. Glory. Oh, god. She slaughtered hundreds of men. But I can feel them ... breaking.
dawn_summers Ben, something is happening to both you and Glory.
ben I'm remembering her, aren't I? The things she's done ... things she's going to do.
dawn_summers I know. She told me. I think ... whatever the magic is that keeps you guys apart, it's starting to break down. Ben, Glory could come back any minute.
ben How could she do this?
dawn_summers I don't know. But we have to get out of her and, and find Buffy-
ben No! I mean, I have a job. I have a life! And Glory? She never once thinks about me in all this!
dawn_summers Help me.
ben How?
dawn_summers I-
PRIEST#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 Highness!
dawn_summers Please.
PRIEST#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 Is everything all right?
PRIEST#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode21 You're not-
ben I'll take you as far as I can, ditch you before she comes back.
willow_rosenberg Okay ... now this is weird.
young_buffy Hi, Willow. What are you doing here?
willow_rosenberg Actually, I'm, uh ... looking for you. Here. Again.
young_buffy Do you like dolls?
willow_rosenberg No ... and I think we already deja'd this vu.
young_buffy You talk funny.
willow_rosenberg Yes ... as you'll tell me again when we're older and in chem class. Buffy ... what are we doing here?
young_buffy Don't you like it here?
willow_rosenberg We don't have time.
young_buffy Mommy, Daddy!
hank_summers We're home!
young_buffy You're back, you're back!
joyce_summers Hi, Buffy.
joyce_summers We're calling her Dawn.
young_buffy I could be the one to look after her sometimes.
doc It's always open!
doc What can I do for you boys? Want some cocoa?
spike No. We need information. We need-
xander_harris Ben's Glory!
doc Who's what?
spike Look at this. Special Ed remembers.
xander_harris Yeah. I do. Ben's Glory and Glory's Ben. It's like this... fog's lifting.
spike Wonderful. But not why we're here. Hell-god type. Name of Glory-
xander_harris A.K.A. Ben.
spike -has gone missing. She's brewing up some major-league bad, and she's nicked the Slayer's kid sister in the bargain.
doc Hmm. That girl you brought here. Sweet little thing. How'd things work out with her mom? Changed her mind, didn't she?
spike Yeah. You got any idea where Glory would take her?
doc Glory ... Glory. Oh! You don't mean Glorificus. Gosh. What do you wanna get mixed up with her for? That's a sure way to get yourselves killed. I hear she's awfully unpleasant. When it comes to hellgods, my best advice ... is get out of the way ... and stay there.
spike Love to. Can't.
doc Well, uh, other than that ... I'd like to help ... but I-I'm a small-town guy.
doc This Glorificus, if it is her ... whoo, she's big city.
spike She's got Dawn.
doc Right. Well, I may know a fella ... you know, who knows a fella in... in China. He might-
spike How the hell are we supposed to get to China? Teleport?
doc I guess.
doc You know, if you're in that much of a hurry.
doc Wish you luck.
spike You're lying.
spike And what's more ... I believe you're standing right in front of the very thing we need.
doc Idiot.
doc You think only underworld bottom-feeders worship the beast?
doc Her day is coming, boys! And when she returns, then you're gonna see something.
spike Ow!
xander_harris What do we got?
spike Something worth dying for.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, will you just stop a second and listen to me?
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
willow_rosenberg You have to stop doing this.
buffy_summers Doing what?
willow_rosenberg Killing Dawn.
buffy_summers Why?
willow_rosenberg Because this never happened. You never killed your sister.
buffy_summers Will, I did this.
willow_rosenberg In your imagination! None of this is real! Y-you're stuck in some kind of loop!
buffy_summers I don't know what you're talking about. 'Scuse me.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, why are you doing this?
dawn_summers I think they see us.
ben Just stay close to me. Don't look back.
ben Shh! Stay very still.
dawn_summers I'm sorry.
glory Sorry?!
glory That actually hurt, you prepubescent puke.
glory Okay, first thought, just totally spontaneous, unfiltered, off the top of my head ... ow!
glory You hit Ben in his soft human head, and I remember the pain.
glory You probably think I won't waste any precious blood of yours till tonight. You're right. But I know a thousand ways to hurt you that won't spill a drop.
glory You know all those pesky feelings Ben's been having like guilt, empathy? I'm gonna take 'em and mash 'em back down where they belong, okay? Now ... let's have big-girl fun. Just you and...
glory Leave her alone.
ben I said, leave her alone.
glory No, no. Little late in the game to start growing a backbone, Benjamin. Now be good and stay quiet. No you don't! Get over yourself, Ben! This is the way things are! I'm strong, you're weak. This is reality. Stop trying to infect me with your...
ben Do you ever stop talking? I don't know which is worse, waking up in a dress not knowing where I've been, or having to hear all your self-involved ranting!
glory Animal.
ben Wrong, Glory. I'm no animal. This is humanity you're feeling. Welcome to the world.
glory No, no, no!
glory Stick around, chica.
ben I won't let you hurt her, Glory.
glory Ooh, shut your hole, you sanctimonious little meatworm. I'm going home no matter what you do.
ben You really think I'll just let that happen?
glory Benjamin, what are you doing?
ben You need her blood? When I'm through there won't be enough left to fill a bottle cap. Then you, hellbitch, have nowhere left-
glory -to go. Huh!
glory You can't hurt her and you know it, Ben. I know it 'cause I feel what you're feeling. Scared. Shh! Shh! It's okay! You don't wanna die. Who would? I don't.
ben You can't, you're immortal.
glory Nobody has to die here, Ben. Just let me bleed the girl and go home. Everything will work out fine.
ben Do you really believe with all I know that you can trick me?
glory Stop ... and think, baby. We bleed the kid, return me to my seat of power, I become a god again...
ben And I disappear.
glory Ooh, unless somebody up there likes you. Give up the girl ... I could like you a lot.
ben I won't make a deal with you, Glory.
glory When exactly did you get stupid? I'm offering immortality here.
ben I believe you. That's not the problem. You make me immortal, then what? I'd have to kill her to do it and I won't be able to live with that, not even for a day, forget about eternity!
glory Baby, baby, baby Ben. Why do you worry so much? When you're immortal, all this crap you've been carrying around inside ... the guilt, the anger, the crazy-making pain ... Ooh, it all just melts away like ice cream. Trust me. When all this is over I can set you up real nice. I'm making it easy. It's you ... or the girl.
ben I can't accept that.
glory Accept it. I'm a god, stupid.
ben I'm sorry.
dawn_summers No!
ben Don't make this harder than it already is.
ben I'm sorry, I got no choice. It's you or me.
willow_rosenberg No. Buffy! Leave Dawn alone, what is this?
buffy_summers My gift. This is what I do.
willow_rosenberg I'm not talking about this, I'm talking about...
willow_rosenberg ...this.
willow_rosenberg Right here, it happened. I know it's something small, but... it's something. What?
buffy_summers Don't go there, Will.
willow_rosenberg I'm not! You're the one who keeps dragging me back here! A-and you wouldn't be doing that if you weren't trying to show me something.
buffy_summers Do I?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, come on. I-it's your brain. Just tell me.
willow_rosenberg What happened here?
buffy_summers This was when I quit, Will.
willow_rosenberg You did?
buffy_summers Just for a second.
buffy_summers I remember.
buffy_summers I was in the magic shop.
buffy_summers I put a book back for Giles.
buffy_summers Nothing special about it. And then it hit me.
willow_rosenberg What hit you?
buffy_summers I can't beat Glory.
buffy_summers Glory's going to win.
willow_rosenberg You can't know that.
buffy_summers I didn't just know it.
buffy_summers I felt it. Glory will beat me.
buffy_summers And in that second of knowing it, Will...
buffy_summers I wanted it to happen.
willow_rosenberg Why?
buffy_summers I wanted it over. This is ... all of this ... it's too much for me.
buffy_summers I just wanted it over.
buffy_summers If Glory wins ... then Dawn dies.
buffy_summers And I would grieve. People would feel sorry for me. But it would be over. And I imagined what a relief it would be.
buffy_summers I killed Dawn.
willow_rosenberg Is that what you think?
buffy_summers My thinking it made it happen.
buffy_summers Some part of me wanted it. And in the moment Glory took Dawn...
buffy_summers I know I could have done something better. But I didn't. I was off by some fraction of a second.
buffy_summers And this is why...
buffy_summers ...I killed my sister.
willow_rosenberg I think Spike was right back at the gas station. Snap out of it!
buffy_summers What?
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg All this ... it has a name. It's called guilt. It's a feeling, and it's important. But it's not more than that, Buffy. Buffys.
willow_rosenberg You've carried the weight of the world on your shoulders since high school. And I, I know you didn't ask for this, but ... you do it every day. And so, you wanted out for one second. So what?
buffy_summers I got Dawn killed.
willow_rosenberg Hello! Your sister, not dead yet! But she will be if you stay locked inside here and never come back to us.
buffy_summers But what if I can't?
willow_rosenberg Then I guess you're right. And you did kill your sister.
buffy_summers Wait!
buffy_summers Where are you going?
willow_rosenberg Where you're needed. Are you coming?
rupert_giles Buffy? She's back.
xander_harris You're okay?
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm okay.
buffy_summers Hear you found the ritual text.
rupert_giles Uh, something like that, yes.
xander_harris Did you know that ... Ben is Glory?
buffy_summers So I'm told. What do we know?
rupert_giles Um ... well, uh ... ...according to these scrolls, uh, it's possible for Glory to be stopped.
rupert_giles I-I'm afraid it's, um ... well, Buffy, I've read these things very carefully and there's not much ... margin for error. You understand what I'm saying?
buffy_summers Might help if you actually said it.
rupert_giles Um ... Glory ... plans to open a ... dimensional portal ... by way of a ritual bloodletting.
buffy_summers Dawn's blood.
rupert_giles Yes. Once the blood is shed at a certain time and place ... the fabric which separates all realities will ... be ripped apart.
rupert_giles Dimensions will ... pour into one another, uh, with no barriers to stop them. Reality as we know it will be destroyed, and ... chaos will reign on earth.
buffy_summers So how do we stop it?
rupert_giles The portal will only close once the blood is stopped ... and the only way for that to happen is, um ...
rupert_giles Buffy, the only way is to kill Dawn.
