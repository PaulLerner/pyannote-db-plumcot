rupert_giles 'And on that tragic day, an era came to its inevitable end.' That's all there is. Are you ready?
buffy_summers Hit me.
rupert_giles Which of the following best expresses the theme of the passage? A) Violence breeds violence, B) All things must end, C)...
buffy_summers 'B'. I'm going with 'B'. We haven't had 'B' in forever.
rupert_giles This is the SATs, Buffy, not connect-the-dots. Please pay attention. A low score could seriously harm your chances of getting into college.
buffy_summers Gee, thanks. That takes the pressure right off.
rupert_giles This isn't meant to be easy, you know. It's a rite of passage.
buffy_summers Well, is it too late to join a tribe where they just pierce something or cut something off?
rupert_giles Buffy, please concentrate.
buffy_summers Roll!
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Hmm. I broke my No. 2 pencil. We'll have to do this again sometime.
rupert_giles C) All systems tend towards chaos.
buffy_summers I just know that us and the undead are the only people in Sunnydale working this late.
mayor_richard_wilkins, I appreciate you coming.
mayor_richard_wilkins, I realize it is early... for you... but I think you'll agree that this matter is urgent, also... delicate.
mr_trick I'm a very delicate person.
mayor_richard_wilkins, So you feel you can handle this?
mr_trick It's a little out of my element, but I can get you what you need. I know a beast who knows a guy.
mayor_richard_wilkins, Are you sure that subcontracting is the way to go here?
mr_trick Well, this guy's worked your town before, and if he lives up to his rep, this place'll be in flames.
mayor_richard_wilkins, I've made certain deals to get where I am today. This demon requires his tribute. You see, that's what separates me from other politicians, Mr. Trick.
mayor_richard_wilkins, I *keep* my campaign promises.
mayor_richard_wilkins, Where'd I put that Scotch?
buffy_summers And then I was being chased by an improperly filled-in answer bubble screaming, 'none of the above!'
willow_rosenberg Wow. I hope that wasn't one of your prophecy dreams. Probably not.
oz Hey, you know, I took it last year. I could help you get ready. There's this whole trick to antonyms, but... this isn't the place.
willow_rosenberg Oz is the highest-scoring person ever to fail to graduate.
buffy_summers Isn't she cute when she's proud?
oz She's always cute.
willow_rosenberg We could work on it tonight.
xander_harris Work on what tonight?
cordelia_chase Oh, God. Are we killing something again?
buffy_summers Only my carefree spirit.
oz Buffy SAT prep.
willow_rosenberg Oz is helping. He's the highest-scoring...
cordelia_chase We know. We did the impressed thing already.
xander_harris I hate they make us take that thing. It's totally fascist, and personally, I think it, uh, discriminates against the uninformed.
cordelia_chase Actually, I'm looking forward to it. I do well on standardized tests.
cordelia_chase What? I can't have layers?
willow_rosenberg So, Buff, study tonight?
buffy_summers Uh, yes on the studying, no on tonight. I'm putting in Mom time. She's been drastic ever since I got back. And Giles is even worse. I'm supervised 24-7.
buffy_summers It's like being in the Real World house, only real.
willow_rosenberg Hmm.
willow_rosenberg Ooh, candy bars! Lots of 'em!
xander_harris Principal Snyder, thank you! You weren't visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, by any chance?
principal_snyder It's band candy.
buffy_summers Let's hear it for the band, huh? Very generous.
principal_snyder You will sell it to raise money for the marching band. They need new uniforms.
xander_harris Yeah. Those tall, fuzzy hats ain't cheap, huh?
oz But they go with everything.
buffy_summers I'm sure we love the idea of going all Willy Loman, but we're not in the band.
principal_snyder And if I'd handed you a trombone, that would've been a problem, Summers. It's candy. Sell it.
joyce_summers But you're not in the band.
buffy_summers And yet.
joyce_summers Buffy, what would I do with forty chocolate bars?
buffy_summers You could hand them out at the Gallery. 'Buy something Pre-Columbian, get a free cavity.'
joyce_summers Twenty.
buffy_summers You're a good mom.
joyce_summers I'm the best.
buffy_summers No, I'm pretty sure the best moms let their daughters drive.
joyce_summers And yet.
buffy_summers Oh, come on!
joyce_summers Look, let's not have this conversation.
buffy_summers But I took the class. I watched the filmstrips with the blood and the death and the corpses. I'm prepped.
joyce_summers Honey, you failed the written test. They wouldn't even let you *take* the road test.
buffy_summers That was a year ago. And I don't test well... she said, two days before the SATs.
joyce_summers I spend enough time not knowing where you are. I don't wanna add to that the possibility that you're on the highway to Chicago.
buffy_summers I can't believe you. I'm *not* taking off again. Besides, if I wanted to, I could just get on a bus.
joyce_summers Stop. Don't. I just don't want you driving, okay? I want you here.
buffy_summers I'm here. Hmm? See me here. Mm-hm?
buffy_summers Mm... I gotta go.
joyce_summers What, you're going out?
buffy_summers Giles. Slay-study double feature. Could be late.
joyce_summers Again? Honey, don't you think Mr. Giles is monopolizing an awful lot of your time?
buffy_summers And does he ever say he's sorry?
buffy_summers Ow!
rupert_giles Sorry.
buffy_summers Why do I put up with this?
rupert_giles Because it is your destiny... and because I just bought twenty 'cocorific' candy bars.
buffy_summers Okay, you're just doing this to take funny pictures of me.
rupert_giles I'm doing it to test your awareness of an opponent's location during a fight in total darkness. Now, wait five seconds and then throw the ball at me.
buffy_summers You ran out of new training ideas about a week ago, huh? Okay. Five, four, three, two, one.
rupert_giles It's not that simple, is it...
rupert_giles Ow. Ahem. Yes, well, very good.
buffy_summers Thanks!
rupert_giles W-w-w-where are you going? We have to patrol!
buffy_summers I can't. Mom's in hyperdrive. She wants me home tonight. I told you.
rupert_giles But, I...
buffy_summers I know, I know. She's out of control. Enjoy the candy!
angel Buffy.
buffy_summers I didn't know you could do that.
angel I-I'm feeling better.
buffy_summers Angel...
buffy_summers Let's... get you inside.
angel It's late. How'd you get away?
buffy_summers Aw, it was easy. Started a fire in the prison laundry room. Rode out in the garbage truck.
angel Oh.
buffy_summers I'm joking. No garbage. Smell me.
angel How is, uh... Scott?
buffy_summers Scott? Oh, um... boyfriend Scott. Uh... A-actually, he's not... He's fine.
buffy_summers Uh, that's for you.
buffy_summers Uh... I-it's fresh from the butcher.
angel Thanks.
angel You're being careful, right?
buffy_summers With Scott?
angel The slaying.
buffy_summers Oh. Uh... Yeah. Of course. Full of carefulness.
angel I worry about you.
buffy_summers I worry about *you*.
angel I'm getting stronger.
buffy_summers Yeah, pretty soon, you won't even need me.
angel That'll be better.
buffy_summers Yeah.
buffy_summers Hey! Uh, sorry I'm late. You know Giles. All slay, all the time.
rupert_giles Hello, Buffy.
buffy_summers Do you guys wanna watch some television? I hear there's a very insightful Nightline on.
joyce_summers Buffy, you lied to us. And you made us into your alibis. That's... playing us against each other, and that's not fair.
rupert_giles I called Willow. You also lied to her about your whereabouts. We were all concerned.
rupert_giles Oh, thank you.
buffy_summers Look, I'm sorry, but I had to...
joyce_summers Were you at the Bronze? What was happening there that was so important?
buffy_summers Bronze things. Things of Bronze.
joyce_summers You're acting really immature, Buffy.
rupert_giles I know I'm not your parent, but I am responsible for you. I think your mum's right.
buffy_summers Okay, fine. I'm acting like a child. Maybe that's because you're both treating me like a child.
joyce_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers You're both scheduling me twenty-four hours a day. Between the two of you, that's forty-eight hours. I just wanna be able to make a few decisions on my own.
joyce_summers The last time you made a decision on your own, you split.
buffy_summers Yeah, and I took care of myself. I don't need this much active parenting.
joyce_summers You can't really be trying to use this summer as a reason you should be trusted.
buffy_summers You can't babysit me all the time. I need you to back off a little.
rupert_giles Uh, alright, come on. Let's, let's not, uh, freak out.
buffy_summers 'Freak out'?
rupert_giles Mm-hm. Uh, I think you should go to bed. Um, we're all tired.
joyce_summers Oh, she just drives me crazy!
joyce_summers I just want to protect her.
rupert_giles Don't all parents want that?
joyce_summers Yeah, but at least most parents have some idea what to protect their children from.
rupert_giles Yeah. And I think we should both be especially careful.
joyce_summers Mm.
ethan_rayne Trust me. You don't want to eat that.
Boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Think fast.
cordelia_chase I heard that there was a secret rule that if a teacher's more than ten minutes late, we can all leave.
buffy_summers It's Giles' turn to watch study hall. He'll be here. He's allergic to late.
cordelia_chase He is wound a little tight. I had this philosophy book checked out from the library for, like, a year, and he made me pay the fine, even though it was huge. I was sad to return it. It was perfect for starting conversations with college boys. Of course, that was B.X.
buffy_summers B.X.? Before Xander. Clever.
xander_harris I like chocolate. There is no bad here.
willow_rosenberg You still have some left? I went to, like, four houses, and they were gone. It's like Trick-or-Treating in reverse.
xander_harris I know. These things are selling like hot cakes... which is ironic, 'cause the hot cakes really aren't moving...
xander_harris And it's, uh, ahem, fun to sell chocolate. Ahem.
willow_rosenberg And we're raising a lot of money for the band.
xander_harris The band. Yeah. They're great. They march.
willow_rosenberg Like an army. E-e-except with music instead of bullets, and... usually no one dies.
cordelia_chase I can't believe this.
cordelia_chase Where is Giles already? I'm bored, and he's not here to give me credit for it.
principal_snyder The big pinhead librarian didn't show up, and I don't wanna do it. You do it.
ms_barton Alright, fine. I'll do it.
principal_snyder Everybody expects me to do everything around here because I'm the principal. It's not fair.
ms_barton Hey! We're all stuck here, okay? So now let's just sit quietly and, and pretend we're reading something until we're really sure that old Commandant Snyder's gone. Then we're all outta here!
xander_harris Does anyone else wanna marry Ms. Barton?
cordelia_chase Get in line.
willow_rosenberg I guess Giles isn't coming?
buffy_summers I guess not.
rupert_giles Buffy.
buffy_summers Uh... sorry. I... I was just worried. You were a big not-there in study hall, and after your lecture to me on not ducking out... and what is my mother doing here?
rupert_giles We had an opportunity for, um, you might say, a summit meeting. It took priority over study hall. I called in.
buffy_summers Oh.
joyce_summers We decided that you made a good point earlier, honey.
buffy_summers I did. Yeah. Which was...?
joyce_summers A-about us overscheduling you.
rupert_giles Pulling you in two directions, uh, your home life and your duties as a Slayer.
buffy_summers Oh. That was a good point.
joyce_summers We're working out a coordinated schedule for you.
rupert_giles It'll be tight, but, uh, I think we can fit in all your responsibilities.
buffy_summers Sounds nice and structured.
joyce_summers We've got more work to do here, honey. Why don't you give us a little more time?
joyce_summers Um... Take the car, and, um, Mr. Giles can drive me home.
buffy_summers What? Excuse me, I meant what?!
joyce_summers Keys. Take them.
buffy_summers You don't have to tell *me* twice. Well, actually, you did, but... bye!
joyce_summers Bye, honey. Drive careful.
buffy_summers Uh-huh!
joyce_summers Do you think she noticed anything?
rupert_giles No way!
willow_rosenberg Tell me again how it happened.
buffy_summers Told my mom I wanted to be treated more like a grownup, and voila: driviness.
buffy_summers Also, I think she wanted me otherwhere. Considering my mom and Giles are planning my future, I think it's easier for them to live my life if I'm not actually there.
willow_rosenberg Do you know that you have the parking brake on?
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
willow_rosenberg Are, are you sure about the Bronze? I mean, the SATs are tomorrow.
buffy_summers I can study at the Bronze. A little dancing, a little cross-multiplying. You know what we need?
willow_rosenberg Eyes on the road! Eyes on the road!
joyce_summers You got good albums.
rupert_giles Yeah, they're okay.
joyce_summers Do you like Seals and Croft?
joyce_summers Yeah, me neither.
joyce_summers Thanks.
joyce_summers So how come they, uh, call you Ripper?
rupert_giles Wouldn't you like to know.
rupert_giles Hmm, wait a minute. Listen to this bit.
rupert_giles It rocks!
joyce_summers It's good.
rupert_giles Man, I gotta get a band together.
joyce_summers Hey, Ripper, you wanna watch TV?
joyce_summers I know how to order pay-per-view.
rupert_giles No, let's go out and have some fun.
rupert_giles Tear things up a bit.
joyce_summers Okay. We could go to the Bronze.
rupert_giles Not bloody likely. That place is dead.
devon_macleish Hey, they're diggin' us, man!
buffy_summers Let's do the time warp again.
willow_rosenberg Maybe there's a reunion in town or, or a Billy Joel tour or something.
buffy_summers Ms. Barton?
ms_barton Buffy? Whoa!
willow_rosenberg Are you okay, Ms. Barton?
ms_barton Oh, I'm cool, Willow. Willow... That's a tree. You're a tree!
ms_barton Yeah, uh, uh, are there any nachos in here, little tree?
buffy_summers A-are you sure you don't need some fresh air, Ms. Barton?
ms_barton Okay...
willow_rosenberg Hey, this is not normal.
willow_rosenberg Uh, w-well, maybe that goes without saying.
principal_snyder Hey, gang! This place is Fun City, huh?
buffy_summers Principal Snyder?
principal_snyder Call me Snyder. Just a last name, like... Barbarino.
principal_snyder Ooh! I'm so stoked!
principal_snyder Hey, did you see Ms. Barton? I think she's wasted.
principal_snyder I'm gonna have to put that in her next performance review 'cause... 'cause I'm the principal!
willow_rosenberg I don't like this. They could have heart attacks.
buffy_summers Uh, well... ma-maybe there's a doctor here.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Yeeeeaaaaaah!
willow_rosenberg I think that *is* my doctor.
willow_rosenberg He-he's usually less... topless.
principal_snyder I got a commendation for being principal. From the Mayor! Shook my hand twice.
buffy_summers That's nice.
principal_snyder Whoa! There are some foxy ladies here tonight!
willow_rosenberg What's happening?
buffy_summers I don't know, but it's happening to a whole lot of grownups.
willow_rosenberg They're acting like a bunch...
buffy_summers They're acting like a bunch of us.
willow_rosenberg I don't act like this.
mr_trick Demand's high.
ethan_rayne I thought it might be.
mr_trick That's the reason I love this country. You make a good product, and the people will come to you. Of course, a lot of them are gonna die, but that's the other reason I love this country.
mr_trick Hey! Don't sample the product.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 But I didn't.
ethan_rayne Okay. Uh, how did you know he was...
mr_trick I don't. Now I know no one else will. We're getting close. Keep it flowing. It's almost feeding time.
buffy_summers Something's definitely changing them.
willow_rosenberg A spell?
oz They're teenagers. It's a sobering mirror to look into, huh?
principal_snyder You've got great hair.
Old_men#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Louie Louie / Oh, baby / We gotta go / Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah / Louie Louie / Oh, baby / We gotta go / Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
willow_rosenberg It just gets more upsetting.
Old_men#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Louie Louie / Oh, baby / We gotta go / Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
buffy_summers No vampire has ever been *that* scary.
Old_men#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Louie Louie / Oh baby / We gotta go
Patron#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Fight!
principal_snyder Fight!
buffy_summers We've gotta figure out what's going on. This has Hellmouth fingerprints all over it.
principal_snyder Hey, where are we going?
principal_snyder Wait up, you guys!
principal_snyder Hey! You guys aren't trying to ditch me, are ya?
oz We should find Giles. He'll know what's going on, right?
buffy_summers Sure. Except for all we know, he's sweet sixteen again.
willow_rosenberg He's with your mom at his place.
principal_snyder I said, wait up!
oz Uh, Snyder...
buffy_summers No time. He's coming with us.
principal_snyder Whoa, Summers! You drive like a spaz!
willow_rosenberg It'll be okay when we get to Giles'.
oz Of course, I mean, even if he's sixteen, he's still Giles, right? He's probably a pretty together guy.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, well...
oz What?
buffy_summers Giles at sixteen? Less Together Guy, more Bad-Magic-Hates-The-World-Ticking-Time-Bomb Guy.
oz Well, then I guess your mom's in a lotta trouble.
joyce_summers Must be exciting being from England.
rupert_giles Not particularly. You cold?
joyce_summers Nah-uh. I feel... special, like I'm just waking up, kinda.
rupert_giles Oh, yeah?
joyce_summers Yeah, like, uh, getting married and having a kid and everything was just a dream, and now things are back like they're supposed to be.
rupert_giles Yeah?
joyce_summers That's cool! Very Juice Newton.
rupert_giles You fancy it?
joyce_summers Yeah, but the store's closed.
rupert_giles Woo-hoo!
joyce_summers Oh, Ripper! Wow, that was sooo brave!
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Hold it!
principal_snyder This is great! Let's do doughnuts in the football field, huh?
willow_rosenberg Oh, my God, look out!
rupert_giles Ooo... Copper's got a gun!
rupert_giles You'll never use it, though, man.
Officer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Will so.
joyce_summers Ripper, be careful!
rupert_giles Told him he'd never use it.
joyce_summers You are sooo cool. You're like Burt Reynolds.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Sorry! Gotta go!
buffy_summers Oh, God.
buffy_summers Are you guys okay?
willow_rosenberg Is anybody else all creeped out and trembly?
principal_snyder Oh, Buffy... Your mom's gonna kill you.
buffy_summers Something's weird.
oz Something's not?
buffy_summers No grownups.
buffy_summers No one's protecting their houses. Everyone's just... wandering.
principal_snyder Hey!
principal_snyder Hey, give it!
willow_rosenberg Defenseless.
buffy_summers So where are all the vampires?
buffy_summers Soup's on, but no one's grabbing a spoon.
oz Something's happening... someplace that's else.
buffy_summers I'd say something big.
principal_snyder That guy took my candy!
buffy_summers The candy. I-it's gotta be the candy! It's cursed.
principal_snyder A curse?! Oh, I've got a curse.
willow_rosenberg God, using candy for evil!
oz My parents ate a ton.
buffy_summers Who's behind it?
principal_snyder I don't know. It came through the school board. If you knew that crowd...
buffy_summers Where did it come from? Do you know where to get it?
principal_snyder Yeah.
buffy_summers You guys get Xander and Cordelia. Go to the library and look it up.
oz Candy curses?
willow_rosenberg Disturbing second childhood. Got it.
buffy_summers Ratboy and I are going to the source.
buffy_summers Mom? Giles?!
rupert_giles Go away. We're busy.
buffy_summers Mom!
joyce_summers Hey!
buffy_summers Where did you get that coat? Never mind. Listen...
rupert_giles Back off!
buffy_summers Giles, think about this. You wanna fight me, or you wanna let me talk to my mother?
buffy_summers Mom, look at me. Do you know who I am?
joyce_summers Of course. You're Buffy. Hey, look. They're, they're giving away candy. You want some candy?
buffy_summers No, I don't! And you don't need any more, either.
joyce_summers I'm fine. I can have more if I want.
buffy_summers You are *not* fine. You need to go home.
joyce_summers Screw you. I want candy!
buffy_summers Mom!
joyce_summers You wanna slay stuff, and *I'm* not allowed to do anything about it. Well, this is what *I* wanna do, so get off my back!
buffy_summers Mom, please, this is...
rupert_giles Oh, for God's sake. Just let your mum have the sodding candy. C'mon, Joyce...
buffy_summers Mom, look at your car. Look at that dent the size of New Brunswick. I did that.
joyce_summers Oh, my God. What was I thinking when I bought the *Geek* Machine?
buffy_summers Listen to me. You need...
rupert_giles No, you listen to me. I'm your Watcher, so you do what I tell you. Now, sod off!
buffy_summers Take her home.
rupert_giles Joyce...
buffy_summers Mom!
joyce_summers Hey!
rupert_giles Oy! You leave her alone!
principal_snyder Hey, Brit-face! Wait up!
buffy_summers Stay.
principal_snyder It smells so chocolatey.
rupert_giles This is far out.
ethan_rayne Yeah, I've been out there. Town's wide open. You guys can go anytime.
buffy_summers Ethan Rayne.
ethan_rayne Might wanna hurry.
rupert_giles Ethan.
ethan_rayne Ripper.
cordelia_chase At first it was fun, you know? They seemed like they were in this really good moodnot like parentsand then...
willow_rosenberg Badness?
cordelia_chase Mom started borrowing my clothes. There should be an age limit on lycra pants. And Dad, he just locked himself in the bathroom with old copies of Esquire.
xander_harris I don't get this. The candy's supposed to make you feel all immature and stuff, but I've had a ton, and I don't feel any dif...
xander_harris Never mind.
willow_rosenberg I'll take that one.
cordelia_chase You wanna swap?
willow_rosenberg What? Swap?
cordelia_chase You wanna swap? This book is really thick, and I'm not sure it's in English.
rupert_giles Where... Bloody Hell!
buffy_summers That's what smoking will do to you. Now be quiet.
rupert_giles Well... Where'd the bastard go?
buffy_summers Shh!
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Look. A box full of farm-fresh chicken.
joyce_summers Do you suppose they're okay?
principal_snyder Mm-hm. So... are you two kinda... like, um... goin' steady?
buffy_summers So, Ethan, what are we playing? We're pretty much in a talk-or-bleed situation. Your call.
rupert_giles Hit him.
ethan_rayne I-I'd just like to point out that this wasn't my idea.
buffy_summers Meaning...?
ethan_rayne I'm subcontracting. It's Trick you want. I'm just helping him collect a tribute... for a demon.
rupert_giles He's lying. Hit him!
buffy_summers I don't think he is, and shut up.
rupert_giles You're *my* Slayer, go knock his teeth down his thr...
buffy_summers Giles!
buffy_summers What demon?
ethan_rayne I don't remember.
rupert_giles Yes!
ethan_rayne Lurconis. Demon named Lurconis. They wanted a way to get the tribute away from people.
buffy_summers So you're just Diversion Guy?
ethan_rayne More than a diversion. Well, they said the tribute was big, so big that people would never let them take it. That people had to be out-of-it. And later on, when the candy wore off, they'd blame themselves.
buffy_summers Hence, land of the irresponsible. So, where's Trick?
ethan_rayne I don't know exactly.
rupert_giles Hit him again.
ethan_rayne No! I-I-I really don't know. Delivering the tribute.
buffy_summers Which brings us to the bonus question, and believe me when I say a wrong answer will cost you *all* your points.
buffy_summers What's the tribute?
buffy_summers Right. Lurconis.
willow_rosenberg Lurconis. A demon. What's his deal?
buffy_summers See if it says anything about a tribute.
willow_rosenberg A tribute? Like what?
buffy_summers I don't know. My source is all tapped out.
principal_snyder She whupped you good, huh? Yah! Wah! I can do that. I took Tae Kwon Do at the Y.
buffy_summers No, no. It's definitely a demon. A big one.
rupert_giles I wouldn't.
buffy_summers Giles, give me the gun.
buffy_summers Giles...
buffy_summers Now.
joyce_summers Uh, it's, um, it's Willow. She wants you real bad.
buffy_summers Uh-huh?
willow_rosenberg Okay, Oz just found it. 'The tribute to Lurconis is made every thirty years.' I-it's a ritual feeding. A-and this one's late, so it's probably, you know, a big meal.
willow_rosenberg Oh. And... Oh. Lurconis eats babies.
buffy_summers Come on.
joyce_summers Well, what about that man?
buffy_summers Uh, see if you guys can find something to tie him up with.
joyce_summers Um...
buffy_summers *Never* tell me.
Nurse#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 I didn't see anything. I don't *know* where they are.
joyce_summers Something's gonna eat those babies?
Nurse#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 What can *I* do?
principal_snyder I think that is so wrong.
Nurse#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode06 Get off my back about it!
rupert_giles She says she never saw who took them. Dozy cow.
buffy_summers I *know* who took them.
rupert_giles Well, then let's do something. Let's find the demon and, and... kick the crap out of it.
principal_snyder Is that what happens now?
buffy_summers Yeah, if we knew where they were.
rupert_giles 'Lurconis dwells beneath the city, filth to filth.'
buffy_summers What?
rupert_giles Ooo! I know this. Uh... I knew this. 'Lurconis' means... 'glutton'. And we'll find it, um... in the sewers.
joyce_summers The sewers?
principal_snyder Uh, good. You go do that thing with the demon, and I'll stay here in case the babies, you know, uh... find their way back.
joyce_summers The babies must be so scared.
rupert_giles You filthy little ponce. Are you afraid of a little demon?
principal_snyder If you want to splash around in the poo, you're the filthy one!
buffy_summers Okay, you know what? Everybody just stop it! Okay, listen to me. I need help, okay? Giles, I need grownups.
buffy_summers These children are gonna die if we don't act now, okay, and think clearly. There is no room for mistakes. Besides which... you guys are just wigging me out.
rupert_giles Sorry.
joyce_summers We'll behave.
buffy_summers Good. Snyder, go home.
principal_snyder I can do that.
buffy_summers Giles, we're going to the sewers.
buffy_summers And don't do that!
mr_trick Come on, big guy. They're not getting any fresher.
mayor_richard_wilkins, Carol. Hi. Yeah. Call Dave on the public works committee tomorrow about sewer maintenance and repair. I have some concerns regarding exposed gas pipes, infrastructure, ventilation. And, uh... cancel my 3:00.
buffy_summers Hi.
rupert_giles What the hell's that?
buffy_summers Lurconis, I'm thinking.
mr_trick Ordinarily, I like other people to do my fighting for me, but I just gotta see what you got.
buffy_summers Just tell me when it hurts.
buffy_summers Giles! No!
mr_trick You and me, girl. There's hard times ahead.
buffy_summers They never just leave. Always gotta say something.
joyce_summers Can we go home now?
buffy_summers Yeah, we can go home. I've got the SATs tomorrow.
joyce_summers Oh, blow them off. I'll write you a note.
buffy_summers No. It's okay.
joyce_summers Poor babies. Come on...
mayor_richard_wilkins, And your friend?
mr_trick Paid him. The man did his job. No reason to burn that bridge.
mayor_richard_wilkins, This didn't turn out the way I had planned.
mr_trick Where's the downside? You just got yourself one less demon you have to pay tribute to. The way I see it, I did you a favor.
mayor_richard_wilkins, I guess you did.
mayor_richard_wilkins, In the future... I'd be *very* careful how many favors you do for me.
xander_harris Hey, Snyder. Heard you had some fun Friday night. Have you come down yet?
principal_snyder That's 'Principal Snyder'.
xander_harris And that's a big 'yep'.
principal_snyder You look like four young people with too much time on your hands.
oz Not really.
cordelia_chase Busy like a bee, actually. Bee-like!
principal_snyder Good. It seems we had some vandalism Friday on school property, and I was just looking for some... volunteers to help clean it up.
willow_rosenberg 'Kiss rocks'? Why would anyone want to kiss... Oh, wait. I get it.
principal_snyder Let's get you some paint remover.
buffy_summers It was just too much to deal with. It was like nothing made sense anymore. The things that I thought I understood were gone. I just felt... so alone.
rupert_giles Was that the math or the verbal?
buffy_summers Mostly the math.
rupert_giles Well, if you scored low, then you can take them again.
buffy_summers More SATs? Is there really a point? I could die before I even apply to college.
rupert_giles And then, you very possibly might not.
buffy_summers Well, let's just keep hope alive.
rupert_giles Hello.
joyce_summers Hi.
rupert_giles I say, your car seems to have had an adventure, doesn't it?
joyce_summers Uh, Buffy assures me that it happened battling evil, so I'm letting her pay for it on the installment plan.
buffy_summers Uh, hey, the way things were going, be glad that's the worst that happened. At least I got to the two of you before you actually *did* something.
joyce_summers Right.
rupert_giles Indeed.
joyce_summers Y-yes.
