joyce_summers Is it a vampire?
buffy_summers Mom, what are you doing here?
joyce_summers I brought you a snack. I thought it was about time for me to come out and watch. Y-you know, the slaying.
buffy_summers You know, the slaying is kind of an alone thing.
joyce_summers But it's such a big part of your life, and I'd like to understand it. It's, um, you know, something we could share.
buffy_summers A-actually, it's pretty dull, you know, it's bam boom stick... poof.
joyce_summers Good, honey! Kill him!
joyce_summers Buffy, he-he's over here!
joyce_summers Oh, my God! It's Mr. Sanderson from the bank!
joyce_summers And he's getting away!
buffy_summers Stay!
joyce_summers Oh, God. Oh...
Police_Officer_#1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Yes, ma'am.
Police_Officer_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Alright, let's move here. Somebody pull that car out.
buffy_summers They said we can go home now.
joyce_summers They were little kids. Did you see them? They're so tiny.
buffy_summers I saw.
joyce_summers Who could do something like this? I just...
buffy_summers I'm so sorry that you had to see this. But I promise, everything is gonna be okay.
joyce_summers How?
buffy_summers Because I'm gonna *find* whatever did it.
joyce_summers I guess. It's just you can't... you can't make it right.
buffy_summers I know. I'm sorry. But I'll take care of everything. I promise. Just try and calm down.
buffy_summers Don't tell me to calm down!
rupert_giles I-I-I only meant...
buffy_summers They were kids, Giles. Little kids! You don't know what it was like to see them there. My mom can't even talk.
rupert_giles I'm sorry. I... I just want to help.
buffy_summers I know.
rupert_giles Do we know how? Uh... It wasn't a vampire?
buffy_summers No. There were no marks.
buffy_summers Wait. I-I mean, there, there was a mark, um, a-a symbol.
rupert_giles Oh, uh, 12th century, Papal Encyclical. Write on this.
buffy_summers I-it was on their hands. The cops are keeping it quiet, but I got a good look at it.
buffy_summers There. Find me the thing that uses this symbol and point me at it.
rupert_giles Hmm.
buffy_summers Hmm. What? Giles, speak.
rupert_giles What? Oh, sorry. Um, no, it... I just wonder if we're looking for a thing. The use of a symbol o-o-on a victim like this suggests a, a ritual murder and a cult sacrifice by a group.
buffy_summers A group of... human beings? Someone with a soul did this?
rupert_giles Yes, I'm afraid so.
buffy_summers Okay. Then while you're looking for the meaning of that symbol thingy, could you also find a loophole in that 'Slayers don't kill people' rule?
rupert_giles Buffy, this is a dreadful crime, I know, and you have every right to be upset, but... I-I wonder if you're not letting yourself get a shade, uh... more personal because of your mother's involvement.
buffy_summers Oh, it's *completely* personal. Giles, find me the people that did this. Please.
xander_harris Hey.
oz Hey.
xander_harris So, a burrito.
oz This is a burrito.
xander_harris Damn straight.
willow_rosenberg Hi, Oz.
oz Hey.
willow_rosenberg Xander. Hi.
oz Hey, Amy.
amy_madison Hi, guys.
xander_harris Hey, Amy. I like your new hair.
oz I haven't see you all day. Where you been?
xander_harris Not with me. No, sir. Ask anyone. No.
oz So, Buffy's birthday is next week.
xander_harris Ooh! Yeah. Good. I've been pondering gift options.
willow_rosenberg Shh.
xander_harris Oh, come on, we just got a topic here.
willow_rosenberg Hi, Buffy.
xander_harris Buffy! What's up?
buffy_summers You guys didn't hear?
xander_harris Hear what?
buffy_summers A murder. Somebody killed two little kids.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no.
buffy_summers They were, like, seven or eight years old. My mom found the bodies during patrol last night.
amy_madison Oh, my God.
oz Kids?
xander_harris Why was your mom there?
buffy_summers More bad. She picked last night, of all nights, for a surprise bonding visit.
willow_rosenberg God, your mom would actually take the time to do that with you?
willow_rosenberg That really wasn't the point of the story, was it?
buffy_summers No. The point is, she's completely wigging.
joyce_summers Who's wigging?
buffy_summers Um... everyone. You know, 'cause of what happened.
joyce_summers Oh, it's so awful. I-I had bad dreams about it all night.
willow_rosenberg Hi, Mrs. Summers.
joyce_summers Oh, hi, everybody.
xander_harris Hi.
amy_madison Hi, Mrs. Summers.
joyce_summers Buffy, have you talked to Mr. Giles yet about who could have done this?
buffy_summers Yeah. He, uh... He thinks it might be something ritual. A cult. Uh, he's still looking. In the meantime, we're gonna add to my patrol and, and, y'know, keep an eye out.
joyce_summers A cult. Like witches.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. Phlegm. Too much dairy.
joyce_summers Oh, I-I-I know you kids think that stuff's cool. Buffy told me you dabble.
willow_rosenberg Right. Absolutely. That's me. I'm a dabbler.
joyce_summers But anybody who could do this isn't cool. Anybody who could do this has to be a monster. It's...
buffy_summers You know what? Uh, would you guys excuse us for a little bit?
joyce_summers Uh, n-nice to see you.
xander_harris What a burn. I mean, Buff's mom was just starting to accept the whole Slayer thing, and now she's gonna be double-freaked.
willow_rosenberg Makes me grateful that my mom's not interested in my extra-curricular activities.
willow_rosenberg Or my *curricular* activities.
joyce_summers Are your friends gonna help with the investigation, too?
buffy_summers Mom, I really think... Maybe this isn't the best place to talk about this.
joyce_summers Are you embarrassed to be hanging out with your mother? I didn't hug you.
buffy_summers No. It's just... This hall is about school, and you're about home. Mix them, my world dissolves.
joyce_summers It's just, I keep thinking about who could have done such a thing. I have to help.
buffy_summers Well, Giles can always use help in the library.
joyce_summers I called everybody I know in town. I told them about the dead children. They're all just as upset as I am.
buffy_summers You called everybody that you know?
joyce_summers And they called all their friends. And guess what? We're setting up a vigil, for tonight, for City Hall. The Mayor is even gonna be there. Now we are gonna get some action.
buffy_summers Uh-huh. That's great. Uh... But you know what? A lot of times when we're working on stuff like this, we like to keep the number of people that know about it kind of... small.
joyce_summers Oh. Right. Well, I-I'm sure there won't be all that many people.
buffy_summers This is great. Maybe we could all go patrolling together later.
willow_rosenberg At least your mom's making an effort. My mom's probably... standing right in front of me right this second.
willow_rosenberg Mom?
sheila_rosenberg Willow, I-I didn't know you were going to be here. Oh, hi, Bunny.
buffy_summers Hi.
willow_rosenberg Mom, what are you doing here?
sheila_rosenberg Oh, well, I read about it in the paper, and what with your dad out of town... Willow, you cut off your hair! Huh. That's a new look.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, it's just a sudden whim I had... in August.
sheila_rosenberg I like it.
sheila_rosenberg Hello, Joyce.
joyce_summers Sheila, I'm glad you could come.
rupert_giles There you are. I almost didn't find you in this crush. Oh, uh, Mrs., uh... uh, Joyce. Quite a turnout you have here.
joyce_summers Oh, well, it's, it's not just me, but thank you. Well, it's, uh, it's been a while.
rupert_giles Right. Not since, um... Not since... Not for a while.
sheila_rosenberg There's a rumor going around, Mr. Giles.
rupert_giles R-rumor, about us?
rupert_giles A-a-about what?
sheila_rosenberg About witches. People calling themselves witches are responsible for this brutal crime.
rupert_giles Indeed? How strange.
willow_rosenberg Yes! Strange! Witches.
sheila_rosenberg Well, actually, not that strange. I recently co-authored a paper about the rise of mysticism among adolescents, and I was shocked at the statistical...
sheila_rosenberg Oh. Oh, a-are we starting?
mayor_richard_wilkins Hello, everybody.
joyce_summers He'll do something about this. You'll see.
mayor_richard_wilkins Um... I wanna thank you all for coming in the aftermath of such a tragic crime. Seeing you all here proves what a caring community Sunnydale is. Now, sure, we've had our share of misfortunes, but we're a good town with good people, and I know that none of us will rest easy until this horrible murder is solved. With that in mind... I make these words my pledge to you. 'Never again!' Now I ask you to give your attention to the woman who brought us all here tonight, Joyce Summers.
joyce_summers Thank you.
joyce_summers Mr. Mayor, you're dead wrong. This is *not* a good town. How many of us have, have lost someone who, who just disappeared? Or, or got skinned? Or suffered neck rupture? And how many of us have been too afraid to speak out? I-I was supposed to lead us in a moment of silence, but... silence is this town's disease. For too long we-we've been plagued by unnatural evils. This isn't our town anymore. It belongs to the monsters and, and the witches and the Slayers.
joyce_summers I say it's time for the grownups to take Sunnydale back. I say we start by finding the people who did this and making them pay.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Hear, hear!
michael_czajak Watch it.
roy Oh, sorry. Did I make you smudge your eyeliner?
roy You gonna put a spell on me?
amy_madison Hey, what is your problem?
roy Everyone knows he's into that voodoo witchcraft. I heard about those kids. People like him... gotta learn a lesson.
amy_madison And what about people like me?
roy Get in my face and you'll find out.
roy No problem here. We're walking.
buffy_summers You guys okay?
michael_czajak Yeah. We're fine.
amy_madison Thanks, Buffy.
cordelia_chase You'll be one busy little Slayer, baby-sitting them.
buffy_summers I doubt they'll have any more trouble.
cordelia_chase I doubt your doubt. Everyone knows that witches killed those kids, and Amy is a witch. And Michael is whatever the boy of witch is, plus being the poster child for yuck.
buffy_summers Corde...
cordelia_chase If you're gonna hang with them, expect badness. 'Cause that's what you get when you hang with freaks and losers. Believe me, I know.
cordelia_chase That was a pointed comment about me hanging with you guys.
buffy_summers Yeah, I got that one. Besides, witches didn't do it.
rupert_giles Actually, I think they may have. My research keeps bringing me back to European Wiccan covens.
buffy_summers You found the meaning of the symbol?
rupert_giles I'm pretty sure, yes. There's a, a piece of information I need that's in a book that Willow borrowed. Can you find it?
xander_harris Buffy, hi.
buffy_summers Hey. Is Willow around?
xander_harris How can I convince you people that it's over? You assume because I'm here, she's here, that I somehow mysteriously know where she is.
buffy_summers Those her books?
xander_harris Yeah. She's in the bathroom.
xander_harris But the fact that I know that doesn't change that I have a genuine complaint here. Look. I'm getting sick of the judgment, the innuendoes. Is a man not innocent until proven guilty?
buffy_summers You *are* guilty. You got illicit smoochies, gonna have to pay the price.
xander_harris But I'm talking about the future guilt. Look, everyone expects me to mess up again. Like Oz. I see how he is around me. You know, that steely gaze... that pointed silence.
buffy_summers 'Cause he's usually such a chatterbox.
xander_harris No, but it's different now. It's more a verbal nonverbal. He speaks volumes with his eyes.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Buff. What cha looking for? You wanna borrow something?
buffy_summers What is this?
willow_rosenberg A doodle. I do doodle. You, too. You do doodle, too.
buffy_summers This is a witch symbol.
willow_rosenberg Okay, yeah, it is.
buffy_summers Willow...
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers That symbol was on the murdered children.
Police_Officer_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Please step back. Stay away from the lockers. This is police business.
Police_Officer_#4#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Hand them over, please. The books.
xander_harris Aw, man, it's Nazi Germany, and I've got Playboys in my locker!
principal_snyder This is a glorious day for principals everywhere. No pathetic whining about students' rights. Just a long row of lockers and a man with a key.
oz They just took three kids away.
buffy_summers What are they looking for?
amy_madison Witch stuff.
willow_rosenberg What?
amy_madison They got my spells. I'm supposed to report to Snyder's office.
willow_rosenberg Oh, my God.
Police_Officer_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Okay, Amy. You'll have to come with me.
Police_Officer_#4#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Stay away from the locker.
willow_rosenberg I have stuff in my locker. Henbane, hellebore, mandrake root.
xander_harris Excuse me. Playboys. Can we turn the sympathy this way?
cordelia_chase Hey! Get your grubby custodial hands off that.
Police_Officer_#4#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Miss, you have to stay back. Miss, stay back.
cordelia_chase That hair spray costs $45, and it's imported!
willow_rosenberg Oh, God, my locker's next. Buffy, I didn't do anything wrong.
willow_rosenberg The, the symbol is harmless. I used it to make a protection spell for you, for your birthday. With Michael and Amy. Only, now it's broken, because you know about it, so happy birthday, and please, you have to believe me!
principal_snyder Ms. Rosenberg. My office.
buffy_summers Giles.
rupert_giles They're confiscating my books.
buffy_summers Giles, we need those books.
rupert_giles Believe me, I tried to tell that to the nice man with the big gun.
buffy_summers No. There's something about the symbol that we're missing. Willow said she used it in a protection spell. It's harmless. Not a big bad. So then why would it turn up in a ritual sacrifice?
rupert_giles I don't know. Ordinarily, I would say let's widen our research.
buffy_summers Using what? A-a dictionary and 'My Friend Flicka'?
rupert_giles This is intolerable. Snyder's interfered before, but I, I won't take this from that twisted little homunculus.
principal_snyder I love the smell of desperate librarian in the morning.
rupert_giles You get out! And take your marauders with you.
principal_snyder Oh, my. So fierce. I suppose I should hear you out. Just how is, um... 'Blood Rites and Sacrifices' appropriate material for a public school library? Chess club branching out?
rupert_giles This is not over.
principal_snyder Oh, I should say it's just beginning. Fight it if you want. Just remember, lift a finger against me, and you'll have to answer to MOO.
buffy_summers Answer to MOO? Did that sentence just make some sense that I'm not in on?
principal_snyder 'Mothers Opposed to the Occult.' A powerful new group.
buffy_summers And who came up with that lame name?
principal_snyder That would be the founder. I believe you call her 'Mom'.
sheila_rosenberg Oh, sit down, honey.
willow_rosenberg Principal Snyder talk to you?
sheila_rosenberg Yes. He's quite concerned.
willow_rosenberg Mom, I know what this looks like, and I can totally...
sheila_rosenberg Oh, you don't have to explain, honey. This isn't exactly a surprise.
willow_rosenberg Why not?
sheila_rosenberg Oh, well, identification with mythical icons is perfectly typical of your age group. It's a, a classic adolescent response to the pressures of incipient adulthood.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Is that what it is?
sheila_rosenberg Of course, I wish you could've identified with something a little less icky, but developmentally speaking...
willow_rosenberg Mom, I'm not an age group. I'm me. Willow group.
sheila_rosenberg Oh, honey...
sheila_rosenberg I understand.
willow_rosenberg No, you don't. Mom, this may be hard for you to accept, but I can do stuff. Nothing bad or dangerous, but I can do spells.
sheila_rosenberg You think you can, and that's what concerns me. The delusions.
willow_rosenberg Mom, how would you know what I can do? I mean, the last time we had a conversation over three minutes, it was about the patriarchal bias of the Mr. Rogers Show.
sheila_rosenberg Well, with King Friday lording it over all the lesser puppets...
willow_rosenberg Mom, you're not paying attention.
sheila_rosenberg And this is your way of trying to get it. Now, I have consulted with some of my colleagues, and they agree that this is a cry for discipline. You're grounded.
willow_rosenberg Grounded? This is the first time *ever* I've done something you don't like and I'm grounded? I'm supposed to mess up. I'm a teenager, remember?
sheila_rosenberg You're upset, I hear you...
willow_rosenberg No, Ma, hear this! I'm a rebel! I'm having a rebellion!
sheila_rosenberg Willow, honey, you don't need to act out like this to prove your specialness.
willow_rosenberg Mom, I'm not acting out. I'm a witch! I-I can make pencils float. And I can summon the four elements. Okay, two, but four soon. A-and I'm dating a musician.
sheila_rosenberg Oh, Willow!
willow_rosenberg I worship Beelzebub. I do his biddings. Do you see any goats around? No, because I sacrificed them.
sheila_rosenberg Willow, please!
willow_rosenberg All bow before Satan!
sheila_rosenberg I'm not listening to this.
willow_rosenberg Prince of Night, I summon you. Come fill me with your black, naughty evil.
sheila_rosenberg That's enough! Is that clear? Now, you will go to your room and stay there until I say otherwise. And we're gonna make some changes. I don't want you hanging out with those friends of yours. It's clear where this little obsession came from. You will not speak to Bunny Summers again.
joyce_summers I don't want you seeing that Willow anymore. I've spoken with her mother. I had no idea her forays into the occult had gone so far.
buffy_summers You're the one who ordered the raid on the school today.
joyce_summers Honey, they opened a few lockers.
buffy_summers Lockers. First syllable, 'lock'. They're supposed to be private. And they took all of Giles' books away.
joyce_summers He'll get most of them back. MOO just wants to weed out the offensive material. Everything else will be returned to Mr. Giles soon.
buffy_summers If we're gonna solve this, we need those books now.
joyce_summers Sweetie, those books have no place in a public school library. Especially now. Any student can waltz in there and get all sorts of ideas. Do you understand how that terrifies me?
buffy_summers Mom, I hate that these people scared you so much. And I-I know that you're just trying to help, but you have to let me handle this. It's what I do.
joyce_summers But is it really? I mean, you patrol, you slay... Evil pops up, you undo it. A-a-and that's great! But is Sunnydale getting any better? Are they running out of vampires?
buffy_summers I don't think that you run out of...
joyce_summers It's not your fault. You don't have a plan. You just react to things. I-i-it's bound to be kind of fruitless.
buffy_summers Okay, maybe I don't have a plan. Lord knows I don't have lapel buttons...
joyce_summers Buffy.
buffy_summers ...and maybe next time that the world is getting sucked into Hell, I won't be able to stop it because the Anti-Hell-Sucking Book isn't on the approved reading list!
joyce_summers I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put down...
buffy_summers Yeah, well, you did. It doesn't matter. I have to go. I have to go on one of my pointless patrols and react to some vampires. If that's alright with MOO.
buffy_summers And nice acronym, Mom.
joyce_summers Just trying to make things better.
little_boy You are.
little_girl There's bad people out there.
little_boy And we can't sleep.
little_girl Not until you hurt them.
little_boy The way they hurt us.
angel Hey.
buffy_summers Hi.
buffy_summers How are you?
angel I'm alright. I think I'm better than you right now.
angel I heard about this. People are talking. People are even talking to *me*.
buffy_summers It's strange. People die in Sunnydale all the time. I've never seen anything like this.
angel They were children. Innocent. It makes a difference.
buffy_summers And Mr. Sanderson from the bank had it coming? My mom... said some things to me about being the Slayer. That it's fruitless. No fruit for Buffy.
angel She's wrong.
buffy_summers Is she? Is Sunnydale any better than when I first came here? Okay, so I battle evil. But I don't really win. The bad keeps coming back and getting stronger. Like that kid in the story, the boy that stuck his finger in the duck.
angel Dike.
angel It's another word for dam.
buffy_summers Oh. Okay, that story makes a lot more sense now.
angel Buffy, you know, I'm still figuring things out. There's a lot I don't understand. But I do know it's important to keep fighting. I learned that from you.
buffy_summers But we never...
angel We never win.
buffy_summers Not completely.
angel We never will. That's not why we fight. We do it 'cause there's things worth fighting for. Those kids. Their parents.
buffy_summers Their parents.
angel Look, I know it's not much.
buffy_summers No. No, it's a lot.
rupert_giles Session interrupted? Who said you could interrupt, you stupid, useless fad! No, I said fad. And I'll say it again.
xander_harris At that point, I will become frightened.
oz Take heart. We found your books.
xander_harris You can put the heart back. We can't get them. They're locked up in City Hall. 'Frisky Watcher's chat room.' Why, Giles.
xander_harris Oh! Buffy, Oz and I found out...
buffy_summers What do we know about these kids?
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Facts. Details.
xander_harris Well, they were, uh, found in the park.
buffy_summers No. Where did they go to school? Who were their parents? What are their names?
buffy_summers We know everything about their deaths, but we don't even know their names.
xander_harris Well, sure we do. Um, it's on the tip of my tongue.
oz That never came up. Ever.
buffy_summers And if no one knows who they are, where did these pictures come from?
rupert_giles I just assumed someone had the details. I never really... Well, that is strange.
buffy_summers We need to get some information.
rupert_giles Yeah, well, somebody else do it. This thing's locked me out.
xander_harris Well, if you wouldn't yell at it.
oz I can look 'round, but Willow would really know the sites we need.
buffy_summers That's great. She can't even come to the phone. The wrath of MOO.
oz Well, we don't need a phone.
oz Alright, we're linked. If anybody's ID'd the kids, she'll pull it up and feed it here.
rupert_giles Oh. 'Two Children Found Dead. Mysterious Mark...' No. No. These children were found near Omaha in 1949.
xander_harris Yeah, they ain't ours. Keep going.
buffy_summers Wait.
willow_rosenberg Those are...
buffy_summers ...the same kids.
rupert_giles Fifty years ago.
oz '1899. Utah... Two Children... Rural Community Torn Apart by Suspicion.'
rupert_giles A hundred years ago? How is this possible?
oz There's no mention of who they were.
buffy_summers They've never been seen alive, just dead. A lot.
oz Ah. There were more articles. Every fifty years. All the same.
rupert_giles From as far back as 1649. Can I see that?
rupert_giles Written by a cleric from a village near the Black Forest. He... found the bodies himself. Two children... Greta Strauss, age six. Hans Strauss, eight.
xander_harris So they have names. That's new.
sheila_rosenberg Willow. I thought I made myself clear. You're not minding me.
willow_rosenberg Mom...
sheila_rosenberg I see what you're doing. You're challenging me. But I will not have you communicating with your cyber-coven or what have you.
willow_rosenberg Coven? What happened to me being delusional and acting out?
sheila_rosenberg Well, that was before I talked in depth with Ms. Summers and her associates. It seems I've been rather close-minded.
willow_rosenberg So, you believe me?
sheila_rosenberg I believe you, dear. Now all I can do is let you go with love.
willow_rosenberg Let me go? What does that mean?
willow_rosenberg Mom?
rupert_giles Uh, wait, wait a minute. Uh... Uh, there is a fringe theory held by a few folklorists that some regional stories have actual, um, very literal antecedents.
buffy_summers And in some language that's English?
oz Fairy tales are real?
buffy_summers Hans and Gre... Hansel and Gretel?
xander_harris Wait. Hansel and Gretel? Breadcrumbs, ovens, gingerbread house?
rupert_giles Of course! Well, it makes sense now.
buffy_summers Yeah, it's all falling into place. Of course that place is nowhere near this place.
rupert_giles Some demons thrive by fostering hatred and, and, uh, persecution amongst the mortal animals. Not by, not by destroying men, but by watching men destroy each other. Now, they feed us our darkest fear and turn peaceful communities into vigilantes.
buffy_summers Hansel and Gretel run home to tell everyone about the mean old witch.
rupert_giles And then she and probably dozens of others are persecuted by a righteous mob. It's happened all throughout history. It happened in Salem, not surprisingly.
xander_harris Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm still spinning on this whole fairy tales are real thing.
oz So what do we do?
xander_harris I don't know about you, but I'm gonna go trade my cow in for some beans.
xander_harris No one else is seeing the funny here.
buffy_summers Giles, we need to talk to Mom. If she knows the truth, she can defuse the whole thing.
buffy_summers What happened?
michael_czajak I was attacked!
xander_harris Officially not funny.
buffy_summers By whom?
michael_czajak My dad. His friends. They're taking people out of their homes. They're talking about a trial down at City Hall. They got Amy.
buffy_summers Michael, stay here and hide. Giles, we'll go find my mom.
oz Willow!
michael_czajak Tell Willow to get out of her house!
rupert_giles Stay in my office.
willow_rosenberg Mom, we really have to talk.
sheila_rosenberg It's time to go. Oh, and get your coat. It's chilly out.
willow_rosenberg Go? Go where?
sheila_rosenberg I said get your coat, witch!
joyce_summers Did you speak to the families on Sycamore Street?
Woman#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Yes, I did.
joyce_summers Great.
joyce_summers Buffy! Mr. Giles! Did something happen?
buffy_summers Mom, we need to talk to you. Now.
joyce_summers Well, of course, honey. Um, go on without me.
buffy_summers No, we need to talk alone.
buffy_summers Look, there's more to this than...
joyce_summers You were right. I-it was easy.
Gretel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 I told you.
Hansel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 It gets even easier.
Gretel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 But I'm still scared of the bad girls.
Hansel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 You have to stop them. You have to make them go away. Forever.
oz Willow!
sheila_rosenberg Hold still. Be a good girl.
willow_rosenberg No! Why are you doing this to me? Mom?
sheila_rosenberg There's no cure but the fire.
amy_madison Buffy! Wake up!
willow_rosenberg This is crazy, Mom!
amy_madison Buffy! Buffy!
cordelia_chase Wake up!
rupert_giles Cordelia?
cordelia_chase Took you long enough to wake up. My hand hurts.
rupert_giles Pity. Oh... Why are you here?
cordelia_chase Things are way out of control, Giles. First the thing at school, and then my mom confiscates all of my black clothes and scented candles. I came over here to tell Buffy to stop this craziness and found you all unconscious... again. How many times have you been knocked out, anyway? I swear, one of these times, you're gonna wake up in a coma.
rupert_giles Wake up in a... Oh, never mind. We need to save Buffy from Hansel and Gretel.
cordelia_chase Now, let's be clear. The brain damage happened *before* I hit you.
xander_harris What's with the grim? We're here to join you guys.
xander_harris No, really. Why should you guys have all the fun? We wanna be part of the hate.
oz Just so we're clear, you guys know you're nuts, right?
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
joyce_summers Good morning, sleepyhead.
buffy_summers Mom, you don't want this.
joyce_summers Since when does it matter what I want? I wanted a normal, happy daughter. Instead I got a Slayer.
sheila_rosenberg Torch.
joyce_summers Thanks. This has been so trying. You've been such a champ.
sheila_rosenberg Oh, you, too, Joyce.
joyce_summers We should stay close, have lunch.
sheila_rosenberg Oh, I'd like that. How nice.
amy_madison Oh, you can't be serious!
buffy_summers Mom, don't!
amy_madison Alright. You wanna fry a witch? I'll give you a witch! Goddess Hecate, work thy will!
buffy_summers Uh-oh.
amy_madison Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
buffy_summers She couldn't do us first?
willow_rosenberg You've seen what we can do! Another step and you will all feel my power!
buffy_summers What are you gonna do, float a pencil at 'em?
willow_rosenberg It's a really big power!
buffy_summers Yes! You will all be turned into vermin. And some of you will be fish! Yeah, you in the back will be fish!
Hansel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 But you promised.
Gretel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 You have to kill the bad girls.
cordelia_chase I can't believe you had this stuff in your apartment. It smells foul.
rupert_giles Shred the wolfsbane. That's the, uh, the leafy stuff. And then you can crush the satyrion root. Luften sie den something. Schlumer? Schluter?
cordelia_chase What are you muttering about?
rupert_giles It's a part of an incantation. It's in German, and without my book...
cordelia_chase What does it mean?
rupert_giles It's about, uh, lifting a veil. Um, it should, uh, make the demons appear in their true form, which with any luck, will, uh, negate their influence. And, uh, drop a toadstone into the mixture.
cordelia_chase This? It doesn't look like a toad.
rupert_giles No reason it should. It's from inside the toad.
cordelia_chase I hate you.
oz We gotta get inside.
willow_rosenberg No! Oh, God, help!
oz Will?
xander_harris It sounds like she's right... above us?
Gretel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 They hurt us.
Hansel#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 Burn them.
buffy_summers Mom, dead people are talking to you. Do the math!
joyce_summers I'm sorry, Buffy.
buffy_summers Mom, look at me! You love me. You're not gonna be able to live with yourself if you do this!
joyce_summers You earned this. You toyed with unnatural forces. What kind of a mother would I be if I didn't punish you?
cordelia_chase Ouch! You got hair with that!
cordelia_chase God, you really were the little youthful offender, weren't you? You must just look back on that and cringe.
rupert_giles Shh!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, I can't take it! It's too hot!
buffy_summers I'm sorry, Will. If it wasn't for me, none of this would have happened.
buffy_summers It wouldn't be...
joyce_summers Stop them!
cordelia_chase You like that? Huh? How 'bout some more!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, I'm on fire!
buffy_summers Cordelia, put out the fire!
cordelia_chase Oh, right.
rupert_giles Ihr Goetter, ruft Euch an! Verbergt Euch nicht hinter falschen Gesichtern!
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode11 You gods, I call upon you! Do not hide behind false faces!
cordelia_chase Okay, I think I liked the two little ones more than the one big one.
joyce_summers Oh, my God!
demon Protect us! Kill the bad girls!
buffy_summers You know what? Not as convincing in that outfit.
buffy_summers Did I get it? Did I get it?
oz We're here to save you.
buffy_summers Your mom doesn't mind us doing this in the house?
willow_rosenberg She doesn't know.
buffy_summers Business as usual?
willow_rosenberg Hmm, sort of. She's doing that selective memory thing your mom used to be so good at.
buffy_summers She forgot everything?
willow_rosenberg No. She remembered the part where I said I was dating a musician.
willow_rosenberg Oz has to come for dinner next week. So, that's sort of like taking an interest.
buffy_summers Okay, should we try this again?
willow_rosenberg Let's do it. I think we got the mix of herbs right this time.
buffy_summers Okay. Ready?
willow_rosenberg Diana, Hecate, I hereby license thee to depart. Goddess of creatures great and small, I conjure thee to withdraw.
buffy_summers Maybe we should get her one of those wheel thingies.
