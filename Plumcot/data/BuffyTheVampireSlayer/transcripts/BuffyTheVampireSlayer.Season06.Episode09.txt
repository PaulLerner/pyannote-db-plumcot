amy_madison All right! You wanna fry a witch? I'll give you a witch! Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
willow_rosenberg She's a perfectly normal girl. Then, she's a rat.
buffy_summers Maybe we should get her one of those wheel thingies.
tara_maclay Can, can we not do this now?
willow_rosenberg Forget it ever happened.
willow_rosenberg Forget.
tara_maclay What is wrong with you? I know you used that spell on me.
willow_rosenberg I'll go a month without doing any magic.
tara_maclay Go a week.
willow_rosenberg Fine, that's easy!
willow_rosenberg When the fire goes out, when the crystal turns black, the spell will be cast.
tara_maclay I don't think this is gonna work.
willow_rosenberg Are you saying you're gonna leave me?
spike I'm placing an order.
warren_meers Oh no no, I'm not making any more girls.
spike Sure you are. Here's your specs.
warren_meers So ... you guys wanna team up and take over Sunnydale?
andrew_wells@jonathan_levinson Okay.
warren_meers The Trio versus the Slayer.
jonathan_levinson We're like supervillains.
buffy_summers I can't do this without you.
GILES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 You can. That's why I'm going.
GILES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 I'm heading back to England.
GILES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 ...and I plan to stay.
spike We have to talk.
buffy_summers About what?
spike We kissed, Buffy.
HUSBAND#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 I'm sure we can work something out.
WIFE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 A deal of some sort. Anything you want.
buffy_summers I always wanted a pony.
buffy_summers Oh. You weren't really speaking to me, were you? My bad. Well, as long as I'm here...
buffy_summers Wow. A mugging. Haven't gotten one of those in a while.
buffy_summers Usually it's blood, and with the horror ... just a good old-fashioned mugging. Kinda sweet actually.
buffy_summers Oh, uh, probably not for you. Here. Go. Now.
buffy_summers Not too sweet for you either, huh? But come on, rush me. It'll be funny.
spike Yaah!
buffy_summers No!
buffy_summers Gah! Oh!
buffy_summers What the hell are you doing?
spike I thought they were demons.
buffy_summers Way to go with the keen observiness, Jessica Fletcher.
spike Remind me not to help you.
buffy_summers *More* often?
spike Hey. Little sympathy for the man with the migraine here, can we?
buffy_summers Well, that's what you get for attacking a human.
spike Yeah. You'd think if the government was gonna put a chip in my head, they'd at least make it so I could attack criminals and that sort.
buffy_summers Yes, because muggers deserve to be eaten.
buffy_summers Just have to get your rocks off fightin' demons.
spike There are other ways.
buffy_summers And to that, an extreme 'see you later.'
spike Buffy.
buffy_summers Spike ... it's late, okay, can we just finish this another time?
spike Oh, so you wanna jump right to the kissing then, eh?
buffy_summers I am not kissing you, Spike. Once was-
spike Twice.
buffy_summers But not again.
spike You're a tease, you know that, Slayer? Get a fellow's motor revving, let the tension marinate a couple-a days, then bam! Crown yourself the ice queen.
buffy_summers Need a few more metaphors for that little mix?
spike It's only a matter of time before you realize I'm the only one here for you, pet. You got no one else!
willow_rosenberg What's the matter, Amy? You lonely? Oh, we need to get you a nice companion rat that you can love ... play with ... and grow attached to, until one day they leave you for no good reason.
willow_rosenberg Won't that be fun? Relax, Amy. I'm just kiddin'. I swear, if I could figure out how to turn you back... Any way ...
willow_rosenberg '
warren_meers Dude, what are you doing?
jonathan_levinson We're not breaking into Langley here. It's Sunnydale.
andrew_wells Well, you never know what new stuff they have, better safe than-
warren_meers Okay, the security system here is a guy named Rusty.
warren_meers Now get up.
andrew_wells Whoa, head rush. Cool.
warren_meers Guys, come on, quit jerking around.
andrew_wells See, that's cool. How come he gets to play with all the cool stuff?
jonathan_levinson Because I'm allergic to methane and you're still afraid of hot things?
andrew_wells I know.
jonathan_levinson Besides, the tank kept making both of us tip over, remember?
warren_meers Got it!
jonathan_levinson It's beautiful.
warren_meers Boys, congratulations, Phase One of the plan is now complete. Let's get the hell outta here.
rusty What are you boys doing?
warren_meers Um, we're with a tour group. The Get-The-Freeze-Ray tour group. Musta gotten separated.
rusty Museum closed five hours ago.
warren_meers Really?
rusty Uh-huh.
warren_meers Huh! Guess we just lost track of time, we should probably get the *freeze ray* out of here now.
warren_meers 'Cause we love the learning, Rusty. Museums, libraries, Disney Hall of Presidents ... not boring. But more to the point? Good-bye.
warren_meers Dude, that is so cool!
andrew_wells The freeze ray totally worked.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, uh, not exactly.
warren_meers So there's a kink or two. It's just a prototype. I mean, soon we'll have-
jonathan_levinson Hey, that's really neato and stuff, but in the meantime, you know ... ow!
warren_meers Be a bigger wuss.
jonathan_levinson Can we just go back to the lair? Because ... I can't ... really feel my fingers.
warren_meers Yeah, yeah, come on.
andrew_wells Is he gonna like-
warren_meers Oh, he'll be fine. Yeah, he'll defrost in a couple of days, no harm, no foul.
andrew_wells Won't he tell on us?
warren_meers And say what? 'Two guys and a mime took me out with their freeze ray'? That's likely.
warren_meers Come on!
willow_rosenberg Hey. Here's some hot chocolate, you want-
amy_madison No, thanks. Still ... kinda queasy.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Maybe later.
willow_rosenberg Hey, no, i-it's okay.
willow_rosenberg It's, it's just a siren. It's o-it's all right. Okay? You okay?
amy_madison Mm-hm. Yeah. Just ... you know. Everything feels weird. I mean, it's like ... I felt like I was in that cage for weeks. But it can still be okay ... right? I-I can still get into the swing of things, like ... prom's coming up. I-I'm so hoping Larry would ask me. We would make such a splash at- Oh. Oh god. He hasn't asked someone else, has he?
willow_rosenberg Uh, Amy ... three things we have to talk about. One, Larry's gay. Two, Larry's dead. And three, high school's ... kinda over.
amy_madison How long was I in the cage?
amy_madison How long?!
buffy_summers Willow?
buffy_summers Hey. How you doin'?
willow_rosenberg Oh. Uh ... okay.
buffy_summers Yeah?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Not parades and cotton candy, but ... okay.
buffy_summers Will, um ... can I talk to you about something?
willow_rosenberg Of course.
buffy_summers Right. Okay. Um ... You know how we all make choices? And sometimes they're good, and ... sometimes they're ... less good.
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh...
buffy_summers Well, lately, I, uh...
buffy_summers Oh, Tara, hey- Amy?!
amy_madison The whole school?
amy_madison By a giant snake thing. Okay, still adjusting. Hi Buffy.
buffy_summers Hi. How've you been?
amy_madison Rat. You?
buffy_summers Dead.
amy_madison Oh.
buffy_summers Well, I should ... let you guys catch up, I can-
amy_madison No no no, stay. Do you have any cookies?
buffy_summers Uh, yeah, w-what kind?
amy_madison Any kind. Not cheese.
buffy_summers Um, sure, in the, the kitchen, I'll just get 'em-
amy_madison Oh no, I'll grab 'em.
buffy_summers Okay, well, at least, you know, let me make up the, the couch for you? It's late, you should stay here. Everybody does.
amy_madison Thank you.
buffy_summers Wow.
willow_rosenberg I know.
buffy_summers Is ... she gonna be okay?
willow_rosenberg Don't know. She's kinda freaked out. I mean, I would be too.
buffy_summers Wow.
willow_rosenberg I, I just realized I could. Thought of the right thing, and ... it's nice, having another magically-inclined friend around.
willow_rosenberg So, w-what were you gonna tell me? You were sounding all serious.
buffy_summers Huh? Oh. Uh, it's nothing. I mean, the whole Amy, rat, Amy thing ... no way I'm toppin' that.
buffy_summers Hey. How you doin'? Need anything?
amy_madison No, thanks. Good cookies.
amy_madison Sorry about your mom.
buffy_summers Thanks.
amy_madison It's crazy, all the things that've happened since I went away.
buffy_summers No kidding.
amy_madison Snyder got eaten by a snake ... high school got destroyed...
buffy_summers Oh, Gatorade has a new flavor. Blue.
amy_madison See? Head spinning. People getting frozen ... Willow's dating girls ... and did you hear about Tom and Nicole?!
buffy_summers People getting frozen?
TV_REPORTER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 ...in critical yet stable condition as local authorities continue their investigation into the robbery that left one man frozen solid.
reporter Live from the museum, Ryan Morris, KOUS.
amy_madison Weird.
buffy_summers Excuse me, excuse me, thanks.
buffy_summers Great.
spike Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up.
buffy_summers What are you doing here, Spike?
spike Well, you know, a man was frozen alive in there. A little compassion, luv.
spike Uh, you know, as long as we're both here, you might as well tag along. I mean, as a team we could-
buffy_summers Yeah, that never really ends well, does it?
spike It did the other night.
buffy_summers You really seem awfully fixated on a couple of kisses, Spike.
spike And you seem awfully quick to forget about them.
buffy_summers Look. I'm sorry, okay? I'm-I'm sorry if you thought that it meant more.
spike But...
buffy_summers But ... when I kissed you ... you know I was thinking about Giles, right?
spike You know, I always wondered about you two.
buffy_summers What? Oh, gross, Spike! He left. I was depressed. Ergo vulnerability and, and bad kissing decisions. Okay, but, that's all that it was. You have to let it go.
spike Did it work?
buffy_summers What?
spike You convince yourself?
buffy_summers Please, stop.
spike A man can change.
buffy_summers You're not a man. You're a thing.
spike Stop walking away.
buffy_summers Don't touch me!
spike Ahh, ahh, ohh!
buffy_summers You're a thing. An evil, disgusting, thing.
spike Look at all the goodies.
spike That's right, you should scream.
spike Creature of the night here, yeah? Some people forget that.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 Please.
spike She thinks I'm housebroken. She forgot who she's dealing with.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 Anything you want, please-
spike Just 'cause she's confused about where she fits in, I'm supposed to be too? 'Cause I'm not. I know what I am. I'm dangerous. I'm evil.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 I-I'm sure you're not evil.
spike Yes, I am. I am a killer. That's what I do. I kill. And, yeah, maybe it's been a long time, but ... it's not like you forget how.
spike You just ... do it. And now I can, again, all right? So here goes.
spike This might hurt a little.
spike What the hell is going on?
tara_maclay Good god, that's a lot of shake. I mean, I know, part of our ... big ... movie and milkshake fun day, but ... good god, that's a lot of shake.
dawn_summers Helps to wash down the Raisinettes.
tara_maclay Promise me that you will eat something green tonight. Leafy green, not ... gummi green.
tara_maclay The movie was fun.
dawn_summers Yeah. It was ironic when all those cute inner-city kids taught their coach a valuable lesson.
tara_maclay You know that I will always be there for you, right? There, there was actually more of a lead-in when I practiced that at home.
dawn_summers I know.
tara_maclay It's just ... I wanted you to know that ... my moving out had nothing to do with you, and I, I will never stop loving you.
dawn_summers I know. Do you think you'll ever get back together?
tara_maclay I wish I knew.
dawn_summers But you still love her.
tara_maclay Very much. I just ... sometimes ... other things get in the way.
dawn_summers I know. Uh, she's been doing a lot better lately, though. Uh, she's been really good about ... being careful ... a-about stuff.
tara_maclay Well, good. Great, that's ... that's great.
willow_rosenberg Here. Says the guard's definitely gonna live.
xander_harris He's all thawed out, says they used hair-dryers. Huh.
willow_rosenberg Everything slowed down. His nervous system, circulatory system. He's still unconscious.
buffy_summers Anya?
anya It's such a pain. The text I wanted, Giles took it with him. He has this thing that ... owning a book makes it like his property.
buffy_summers What should we do, should we call him? It's like the middle of last night there. Or maybe it's tomorrow. Anyone remember how that works?
willow_rosenberg That's okay, no one freak. We'll just do it another way.
buffy_summers I-I don't think we need to resort to ... I mean...
buffy_summers Oh. Hey, cool.
xander_harris All right, back to basics. A little old-fashioned state-of-the-art hacker action.
buffy_summers That's great, Will, I haven't seen you do that in a long time.
buffy_summers I-I don't remember that part.
willow_rosenberg It's quicker. It'll just take me a sec to go through the files. Okay. Internal police report.
willow_rosenberg A diamond was stolen from the museum last night. A big one. On loan from the British museum. They're withholding information to smoke out the criminals. Oh! It's pretty. There's a picture.
buffy_summers Well, is it a, a supernatural diamond? You know, like, healing powers, or, or good-lucky?
anya Maybe it's cursed. Diamonds are excellent for cursing.
willow_rosenberg Well, we'll keep checking, shall we?
xander_harris Well, you know, I am kinda beat, and I bet you that's tiring, that ... thing you're doing there...
willow_rosenberg Guys, I'm fine. What's the deal with-
anya Oh, for crying out loud. This is bizarre. You're all, 'la la la!' with, with the magic, and the not talking, like everything's normal, when we all know that Tara up and left you and now everyone's scared to say anything to you. Except me. Is this that thing I do that you were commenting-
willow_rosenberg Guys ... it's okay. It's hard ... but i-it's better this way. Little things just ... starting taking over, things that didn't matter, but we saw them differently, so ... they got blown out of proportion. And, this time away will help us sort through things. Really. Now, let's just keep working on this. I don't wanna leave Amy alone in the house so long.
xander_harris Amy, is she ... how is she adjusting?
willow_rosenberg It's hard to say. It's a lot to take in. I keep expecting her to do, like, ratty stuff, you know, licking her hands clean, shredding newspaper, leaving little pellets in the corner.
buffy_summers Let's definitely not leave her alone in the house too long.
jonathan_levinson I didn't know it'd be so sparkly.
andrew_wells It's so big.
warren_meers Yes, gentlemen, it turns out, size is everything. No offense, man.
andrew_wells It makes colors with the light.
warren_meers All right, I think we've finished the first part, now it's time for Phase Two.
warren_meers Is the van fired up?
jonathan_levinson Check.
andrew_wells Hello, it's called knocking.
spike Knock knock, robot boy. Need you to look at my chip.
jonathan_levinson Is that like, British slang or something? 'Cause we're not-
spike In my head, the chip in my head.
warren_meers We're kind of in the middle of something.
spike Well, you can play holodeck another time. Right now, I'm in charge.
warren_meers Yeah, what are you gonna do if we don't especially feel like maybe playing your-
warren_meers What are, wait, what are you doing?
spike Examine my chip, or else Mister... ...Fett here is the first to die.
jonathan_levinson Hey, all right, let's not, let's not do anything crazy here.
andrew_wells That's a limited edition, 1979 mint condition Boba Fett.
warren_meers All right, dude ... chill. You can still make it right. You know you don't wanna do this.
spike What I want ... is answers, nimrod.
warren_meers Right. But you don't wanna hurt the Fett, 'cause man, you're *not* comin' back from that. You know, you don't just do that and walk away.
spike That right? Let's find out.
warren_meers Wah, uh, one second.
andrew_wells Dudes, I think that's Spike.
jonathan_levinson Of course it is, and he's evil. Completely capable of removing that head.
warren_meers I'm gonna help him out.
jonathan_levinson Are you sure we can trust him? I mean, we all have heads too.
warren_meers See, we help him, and he owes us one. See, we get Spike on our side, we get info on Buffy. And maybe, maybe we can even find a way to keep her out of Phase Two.
andrew_wells Jonathan's right, can we trust him?
warren_meers 'Course not. But alliances aren't about trust. See, he needs us, we need him. Well, that's how these things work.
warren_meers I think we're ready. Agreed?
jonathan_levinson Agreed.
andrew_wells Do what you need to do.
warren_meers I think we can work something out. I'll take a look at your chip. It'll be a deal. We scratch your back, you scratch-
spike I'm not scratching your anything. You do what I tell you, that's the deal. Deal?
warren_meers Deal.
spike Then let's go.
andrew_wells Oh! It's okay, it's okay. It'll be fine.
willow_rosenberg Amy?
amy_madison Oh god, you're back. I thought you said you wouldn't be gone that long.
willow_rosenberg I wasn't. I mean, I thought it was-
amy_madison Let's go somewhere.
willow_rosenberg Don't you wanna go see your dad?
amy_madison No. Can't. Not yet. Too many questions.
willow_rosenberg About where you were.
amy_madison No, about how I got there. I wish there was a way that I could make him forget about the last three years.
willow_rosenberg Oh, well hey, I can help you with that. Only, you might wanna sew your name into your clothes first or something.
amy_madison No ... I just don't wanna deal with him right now. I think I would be... ...bored.
willow_rosenberg Well.
amy_madison Come on, let's get outta here.
willow_rosenberg Oh, well, what do you wanna do?
amy_madison I don't know. Something fun. Anything ... not involving a big wheel. Or ... maybe ... you'd rather sit home all night, alone, like in high school.
willow_rosenberg No! No, you know what? I can have fun. Heck, I, I deserve some fun.
amy_madison Yeah you do!
willow_rosenberg I can party! Not like I owe anyone anything. I am totally free. So, let's make with the fun.
andrew_wells You're English, right?
spike Yeah.
andrew_wells I've seen every episode of
jonathan_levinson 'Cause it's not out yet on DVD.
andrew_wells Right. It's not out on ... DVD.
spike Warren!!
warren_meers Here I am, here.
spike Bloody hell. Get on with it then.
spike Help me out here, Spock, I don't speak loser.
warren_meers Okay, right, um ... your chip works fine, yeah.
spike There's gotta be something wrong-
warren_meers No, no, listen. I don't know what that thing does ... I'd like to...
spike Hey.
warren_meers But whatever it is, it works fine. There's no deterioration of the signal, it still is coming through on a steady pulse. Which it's supposed to.
spike If you're lying to me-
warren_meers No! It's all right here. I, I mean, it is. It's really not that hard to figure out, if you just... What?
spike You tell anyone about this...
warren_meers No, I promise. Who would I tell, I don't even know what this is about!
spike It's about the rules having changed.
spike Everything's different now.
spike Nothing wrong with me. Something wrong with her.
dawn_summers Hello! We're home!
tara_maclay Looks like no one's here.
dawn_summers Well, I'm sure they'll be back soon. Um, I know Willow and Buffy were meeting up with Xander to do some research.
tara_maclay Well then I, I should really get back.
dawn_summers Or, you can stay and wait for them. Then you can get a chance to catch up with ... everyone.
tara_maclay Yeah, I-I don't think that's such a great idea.
dawn_summers Okay. Your call. I have the TV to keep me company until they get back.
dawn_summers You notice how it's been getting dark so much earlier these days?
dawn_summers Talking cat.
tara_maclay Fine. I'll stay, but just until they get back. And only to make sure that you're not alone, this ... has nothing to do with ... anyone else.
dawn_summers Sure. Cool. Up to you.
willow_rosenberg I know. Xander engaged, I couldn't believe it either.
amy_madison It's just so weird. So what's she like?
willow_rosenberg Thousand-year-old capitalist ex-demon with rabbit phobia.
amy_madison Well, that's so his type.
GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey.
amy_madison Hey.
amy_madison Well, let's go then. We're gonna go dance. Do you wanna come?
willow_rosenberg Oh, uh, no, you go. I'll keep an eye on our drinks.
amy_madison Okay. I mean, because, if you want something a little more your style...
amy_madison I'm sure we can swing that.
willow_rosenberg No, really, no.
brie Hi. Bree.
willow_rosenberg Willow. Nice ... um ... top.
willow_rosenberg No. Thanks, but no.
amy_madison You sure?
willow_rosenberg I'm not, she, I'm still-
amy_madison It's cool.
brie Oh, uh, sorry.
GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 So, uh, are we gonna go?
amy_madison You sure you're gonna be okay?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, go. I'm all kinds of good.
willow_rosenberg No use looking at me like that. It's the gullet for you, mister.
amy_madison Hey! Sorry, I kinda got caught up.
willow_rosenberg No, it's okay.
amy_madison You know ... if rats could dance ... they probably wouldn't gnaw so much.
GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 Hey, come on. We're just getting started.
amy_madison I think I'm gonna sit this one out.
GUY_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 Nuh-uh! You can't, you can't just work us up like that and then just-
amy_madison Hey!
willow_rosenberg I think she said no.
GUY_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 Well, nobody asked you ... Ellen.
amy_madison You wanna dance?
GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode09 That's all. Nice, slow ... relaxing dance.
willow_rosenberg Gee.
amy_madison I think I do feel more relaxed.
xander_harris Aha! I got it! Uh, here's our villain right here!
xander_harris What?
anya That's a D&D; manual, sweetie.
xander_harris No, but it could- Oh.
anya Let's face it, we're not gonna find this thing because it doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a frost monster who eats diamonds.
buffy_summers Well, maybe he doesn't eat them. You know, maybe he just ... thinks they're pretty.
buffy_summers We suck.
xander_harris We need new brains. What's up with Willow?
buffy_summers Out with Amy, I guess.
anya Great, someone to do more magic with.
buffy_summers But at least she's not all cooped up and crying. That's forward momentum. Now, I know that I don't ... know everything that happened with her and Tara, but it-
xander_harris Tara thinks Willow is doing too much magic. And she's not the only one.
buffy_summers I know. But I-I think she'll be fine. You know, it's, it's Willow. She of the level head.
anya Well, those are the ones you have to watch out for the most. Responsible types.
buffy_summers Right, she might go crazy and start alphabetizing everything.
anya I'm serious. Responsible people are ... always so concerned with ... being good all the time, that when they finally get a taste of being bad ... they can't get enough. It's like all kablooey.
buffy_summers That's not true.
anya Okay, not kablooey, more like bam.
xander_harris It's human nature, Buff. Will's getting a taste of something powerful, way bigger than her.
anya Yeah, she was getting out of control with it before Tara left, and now that she's gone...
xander_harris It's gotta be seductive.
xander_harris Just giving in to it. Going totally wild.
xander_harris We need to keep an eye on her.
buffy_summers Okay. Okay, we'll, we'll keep an eye. But we can't assume that everybody's getting seduced, you know, sometimes-
buffy_summers Hello, Magic Box.
spike Slayer.
buffy_summers Spike?
spike Meet me at the cemetery. Twenty minutes. Come alone.
buffy_summers Spike?
spike Bloody hell. Yes, it's me.
buffy_summers You're ... calling me on the phone?
spike Just be there.
buffy_summers Why? Are you ... helping again? You have a lead on this frost monster thingie?
spike Something like that, yeah. Thought you might be up for a little grunt work.
buffy_summers What?! No, no-no grunting!
spike I was talking shop, luv, but if you got other ideas ... you, me, cozy little tomb with a view...
xander_harris So, what did Captain Peroxide want?
buffy_summers Nothing! You know, he just, you know, wanted to see if I-I wanted to patrol, for, for the, the monster. But I, I told him that I ... would ... not.
buffy_summers I'm telling you, I, I think there's something about this thing.
xander_harris Well, I don't know, Buff. It seems like we've been through every book.
anya Yeah, even the ones that weren't so boring you wanted to kill yourself.
xander_harris We have those?
buffy_summers I'm just saying, all the things that have happened lately? Okay, the, the bank robbery, the jewelry heist...
xander_harris The exploding lint.
buffy_summers I-is it me, or do these things seem really-
anya Lame?
buffy_summers Well, I was gonna go with unusual, but, yeah.
buffy_summers I don't know. You know, I'll do a quick patrol tonight, and after a good night's sleep, we can solve this tomorrow.
anya Optimism. I remember optimism.
xander_harris That's because you're like a thousand.
buffy_summers Good night, guys.
anya@xander_harris Good night.
spike Slayer.
buffy_summers And so my night is now complete.
spike You never showed.
buffy_summers Sorry. Little busy actually doing stuff.
spike You shouldn't be so flip, luv.
buffy_summers What are you gonna do, walk behind me to death?
spike I'm just saying things might be a little different.
spike You oughta be careful.
buffy_summers Enough.
buffy_summers Get out of my way.
spike Or what?
