xander_harris So, what do you think?
buffy_summers It's nice.
xander_harris But do you think Cordelia will like it?
buffy_summers I don't know.
buffy_summers Does she know what one of these is?
xander_harris Okay, big yuks. When are you guys gonna stop making fun of me for dating Cordelia?
buffy_summers I'm sorry. But never. I just think you could find somebody more... better.
xander_harris Uh, parallel universe, maybe. Here the only other person I'm interested in is, um... unavailable. Besides, Cordy and I are really getting along. We're not fighting as much, and yesterday we just sat together, not even speakin'. You know, just, uh, enjoying comfortable silence. Man, that was dull.
buffy_summers I'm glad that you guys are getting along. Almost really. And don't stress over the gift.
xander_harris Well, this is new territory for me. I mean, my valentines are usually met with heartfelt restraining orders.
buffy_summers She'll love it.
xander_harris I wish dating was like slaying: you know, simple, direct, stake to the heart, no muss, no fuss.
buffy_summers Sorry to say, Xand, slaying is a tad more perilous than dating.
xander_harris Well, you're obviously not dating Cordelia.
cordelia_chase Wait up. Hey, wait up! Excuse me! Where's the fire sale?
harmony_kendall Oh, sorry. Didn't see you.
cordelia_chase Well, why didn't you call me back last night? We need to talk about our outfits for the dance. I'm gonna wear red and black, so you need to switch.
kate Red and black? Is that what Xander likes?
cordelia_chase Xander? What does he have to do with this?
harmony_kendall Well, a girl wants to look good for her geek.
cordelia_chase Xander's just...
harmony_kendall When are you two gonna start wearing cute little matching outfits? 'Cause I'm planning to vomit. Let's go.
miss_beakman Papers on my desk. Anybody tries to leave without giving me a paper is looking at a failing grade.
xander_harris Ha, ha, ha. This time I'm ready for you. No 'F' for Xander today. No, this baby's my ticket to a sweet D-minus.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Amy.
amy_madison Hey. Are you guys going to the Valentine's Day dance at the Bronze? I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
buffy_summers Go ahead. You know you wanna say it.
willow_rosenberg My boyfriend's in the band!
amy_madison Cool.
buffy_summers I think you've now told everybody.
willow_rosenberg Only in this hemisphere.
amy_madison What about you?
buffy_summers Oh, Valentine's Day is just a cheap gimmick to sell cards and chocolate.
amy_madison Bad breakup, huh?
buffy_summers Believe me when I say, 'uh-huh'.
miss_beakman Thank you.
miss_beakman Thank you.
miss_beakman Thank you, Amy.
willow_rosenberg I just hate to think of you solo on Valentine's Day.
buffy_summers I'll be fine. Mom and I are gonna have a pig-out and vid fest. It's a time-honored tradition among the loveless.
xander_harris Did you guys see that?
buffy_summers See what?
xander_harris In class. I think Amy just worked some magic on Ms. Beakman.
buffy_summers You mean like witchcraft?
willow_rosenberg You know, her mom's a witch.
buffy_summers And an amateur psycho. Amy's the last person that should be messing with that stuff.
xander_harris Maybe I should go talk to her.
rupert_giles Buffy! Buffy... Might I have a word?
buffy_summers Have a sentence, even.
rupert_giles Oh. Good. Well, uh...
jenny_calendar Back it up before you leave.
jenny_calendar Rupert.
rupert_giles Ms. Calendar.
jenny_calendar I'm glad we ran into each other, actually. I was hoping that we could, uh... Do you have a minute?
rupert_giles Um... Actually, not, not just now. Um, I, uh, have a matter to discuss with, with Buffy.
buffy_summers Right. Let's go.
buffy_summers Are you okay?
rupert_giles Me? I-I-I'll be fine. Um, I was more concerned about you, actually. Uh, since Angel, um... uh... turned... I've, um, been reading up on, on his earlier activities. Y'know, uh, feeding patterns a-and the like.
buffy_summers And?
rupert_giles Around Valentine's Day, he, he, he's rather prone to, uh... well, um, brutal displays of, uh... He would think of it as affection, I suppose.
buffy_summers Like what?
rupert_giles No, no, uh, no need to go into details.
buffy_summers That bad?
rupert_giles Suffice it to say I, I think it would be best if you stayed off the streets for a few nights. I-I-I'll, um... I'll patrol and keep an eye on things. Better safe than sorry.
buffy_summers It's a little late for both.
spike Fancy it, pet?
drusilla Ahhh. It's beautiful. Mm.
spike Nothing but the best for my gir...
angel Happy Valentine's Day, Dru.
drusilla Oh... Angel!
drusilla It's still warm.
angel I knew you'd like it. I found it in a quaint little shopgirl.
angel Cute. Here.
spike I'll get it.
angel Done. I know Dru gives you pity access, but you have to admit it's so much easier when I do things for her.
spike You would do well to worry less about Dru and more about that Slayer you've been tramping around with.
angel Dear Buffy. I'm still trying to decide the best way to send my regards.
spike Why don't you rip her lungs out? It might make an impression.
angel Lacks... poetry.
spike It doesn't have to. What rhymes with lungs?
drusilla Don't worry, Spike. Angel always knows... what speaks to a girl's heart.
willow_rosenberg Oz has his cool hair today.
willow_rosenberg I think I'm a groupie!
cordelia_chase Oh, hey!
harmony_kendall Let's get outta here.
buffy_summers Here.
buffy_summers Mom?
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Buffy, it's me.
buffy_summers Yeah. You just startled me a little.
joyce_summers I was just checking the back door. Somebody, um, left these for you.
xander_harris Hey.
cordelia_chase Your clothes... You look so good.
xander_harris Oh. I let Buffy dress me. Well, not physically.
cordelia_chase Perfect. You had to make this harder, didn't you?
xander_harris Okay, clearly the fact that I please you visually has got us off on the wrong foot here.
cordelia_chase Xander...
xander_harris Let me finish. I've been thinking a lot about us lately... the why and the wherefore. You know, once, twice, a kissy here, a kissy there. And you can chalk it all up to hormones. A-and maybe that's all we have here. Tawdry teen lust. But maybe not. Maybe something in you sees something special inside me. And vice versa. I mean, I think I do. See something. So...
cordelia_chase Xander... Thank you. It's beautiful. I wanna break up.
xander_harris Okay, not quite the reaction I was looking for.
cordelia_chase I know. I'm sorry. It's just... Who are we kidding? Even if parts of us do see specialness, we don't fit.
xander_harris Yeah! Okay... Do you know what's a good day to break up with somebody? Any day besides Valentine's Day! I mean, what, were you running low on dramatic irony?
cordelia_chase I know. I didn't mean to do it this way. I...
xander_harris Well, you did.
jock Dude. Way to get dumped.
xander_harris Ooo, Buffy, my bud, you will not believe...
buffy_summers Can't talk right now. Angel.
xander_harris Do you need help?
buffy_summers It's alright.
harmony_kendall Gee, Xander, maybe you should learn a second language so that even more girls can reject you.
amy_madison What are you doing?
xander_harris Amy. Good to see you. You're a witch.
amy_madison No, I'm not. That, that was my mom, remember?
xander_harris Yeah, I'm thinking it runs in the family. I saw you working that mojo on Ms. Beakman. Maybe I should go tell somebody about...
amy_madison That's not even... That is so mean!
xander_harris Blackmail is such an ugly word.
amy_madison I didn't say blackmail.
xander_harris Yeah, but I'm about to blackmail you, so I thought I'd bring it up.
amy_madison What do you want?
xander_harris What do I want? I want some respect around here. I want, for *once*, to come out ahead. I want the Hellmouth to be working for me. You and me, Amy... we're gonna cast a little spell.
amy_madison A love spell?
xander_harris Yeah. You know, just the basic can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe anything but little old moi.
amy_madison Well, that kind of thing is the hardest! I mean, to make someone love you for all eternity?
xander_harris Whoa! Whoa, back up. Who said anything about eternity? A man can only talk self-tanning lotion for so long before his head explodes.
amy_madison Well, then I don't get it. If you don't wanna be with her forever, then what's the point?
xander_harris The point is I want her to want me. Desperately. So I can break up with *her* and subject her to the same hell she's been puttin' *me* through.
amy_madison Oh, I don't know, Xander. Intent has to be pure with love spells.
xander_harris Right. I intend revenge. Pure as the driven snow. Now, are you gonna play, or do we need to have another chat about invisible homework?
amy_madison I'll need something of hers. A personal object.
xander_harris Alright.
buffy_summers 'Soon' what, Giles? You never held out on me until the big, bad thing in the dark became my ex-honey.
rupert_giles Where did this come from?
buffy_summers He said it with flowers. Look, this isn't the time to start becoming Mr. Protective Guy. I can't just hang around, and I can't prepare when I don't know what's coming.
rupert_giles N-no, of-of course, you're right. Uh, s-s-sit, sit down.
xander_harris Oh, come on, don't flatter yourself. I'm not gonna make a big scene. I just want the necklace back.
cordelia_chase What? I thought it was a gift.
xander_harris No. Last night it was a gift. Today it's scrap metal. Figure I can melt it down and sell it for fillings or something.
cordelia_chase You're pathetic!
xander_harris Come on, I'm not gonna add to the Cordelia Chase castoff collection.
cordelia_chase It's in my locker.
xander_harris I can wait.
cordelia_chase Here. It's a good thing we broke up. Now I don't have to pretend I like it.
amy_madison Diana... goddess of love and the hunt... I pray to thee. Let my cries bind the heart of Xander's beloved. May she neither rest nor sleep until she submits to his will only.
amy_madison Diana, bring about this love and bless it.
amy_madison Blow out the candle now!
cordelia_chase What?
xander_harris Morning, ladies. Some kind of weather we've been having, huh?
cordelia_chase What do you want? You can't be sniffing around for more jewelry to melt, because all you ever gave me was that Smallmart-looking thing.
xander_harris Is this love? 'Cause maybe on you it doesn't look that different.
cordelia_chase What are you doing? Are you going, like, stalker-boy on me now?
xander_harris Sorry. My mistake.
cordelia_chase Yeah, I should say so.
cordelia_chase What is his deal?
rupert_giles Look, here's another. Here. Um, 'Valentine's Day.' Yes, uh... 'Angel nails a puppy to the...'
buffy_summers Skip it.
rupert_giles Uh, but it...
buffy_summers I don't wanna know. I don't have a puppy. Skip it.
rupert_giles Right you are. I'll get another batch.
xander_harris I have a plan: we use me as bait.
buffy_summers You mean make Angel come after you?
xander_harris No, I mean chop me into little pieces and stick me on hooks for fish to nibble at 'cause it would be more fun than *my* life.
buffy_summers Yeah. I heard about you and Cordy. That's her loss.
xander_harris Yeah. Not really the popular theory.
buffy_summers You know what I'd like? Why don't you and I do something together tonight? Just the two of us.
xander_harris Really?
buffy_summers Yeah. We can comfort each other.
xander_harris Well, would lap dancing enter into that scenario at all? 'Cause I find that very comforting.
buffy_summers Play your cards right...
xander_harris Okay, uh... You do know that I'm Xander, right?
buffy_summers I don't know, I just... heard that you and Cordy broke up, and I guess I was just surprised how glad I was. It's funny... how you can see someone every day but not really see them. You know?
xander_harris Yeah, it's funny. And it's just gettin' funnier.
amy_madison Xander, can I talk to you for a minute?
xander_harris Yeah, okay.
amy_madison Xander.
xander_harris Yeah.
amy_madison I don't think the spell worked out right.
xander_harris Oh, yeah, it bombed. No biggie.
amy_madison Well, we can always try again.
amy_madison I am still pretty new at this.
xander_harris Oh, no, no, no. It's okay. You know what? It was wrong to meddle with the forces of darkness. I see that now. I think we've all grown. I gotta go.
amy_madison Oh, we don't have to cast any spells.
amy_madison We can just... hang out.
xander_harris Sure. What?
amy_madison Well, I liked spending time with you. You're so sweet. You know, it's funny how you can... you can see a person every day and...
xander_harris Not really see them.
amy_madison Exactly. So, anyway, I thought it might...
cordette Hi, Xander.
xander_harris What?
cordette You're in Mr. Baird's history class, right?
xander_harris Yeah.
cordette I thought maybe we could study together tonight.
amy_madison Do you mind? We were talking.
xander_harris Uh, I really gotta go. Right now.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. I wanted to surprise you.
xander_harris Good job! High marks.
willow_rosenberg Don't be so jumpy. I've been in your bed before.
xander_harris Yeah, but Will, we were both in footy pajamas.
willow_rosenberg Xand, I've been thinking.
xander_harris Will, I, I think I know what you've been thinking. But this is all my fault. I cast a spell, and it sort of backfired.
willow_rosenberg How long have we been friends?
xander_harris A long, long time. Too long to do anything that might change that now.
willow_rosenberg Well, friendships change all the time. People grow apart. They grow closer.
xander_harris Uh, this is good! How close we are now. I feel very comfortable with this amount of closeness. In fact, I can even back up a few paces and still be happy. See?
willow_rosenberg I want you, Xander... to be my first!
xander_harris Baseman. Please tell me we're talking baseball.
willow_rosenberg Shhh.
willow_rosenberg We both know it's right.
xander_harris It's not that I don't find you sexy.
willow_rosenberg Is it Oz? Don't worry about him. He's sweet, but... he's not you.
xander_harris Yes, he is. And you should go to him. 'Cause he's me.
xander_harris I-I don't wanna use force.
willow_rosenberg Mm. Force is okay!
xander_harris Th-that's it! This has gotta stop. It's time for me to act like a man. And hide.
cordelia_chase Ha. Very funny. What did I do now, wear red and purple together?
harmony_kendall You know what you did. Xander is wounded because of you.
cordelia_chase Are you tripping? I thought you wanted me to break up with him!
harmony_kendall Only a sick pup would let Xander get away, no matter what her friends said.
cordelia_chase What does it take to make you people happy?
rupert_giles Xander. What is it?
xander_harris It, it's me... throwing myself at your mercy.
rupert_giles What? Why?
xander_harris I made a mess, Giles. See, I found out that Amy's into witchcraft, and I was hurt, I guess, so I... made her put the love whammy on Cordy, but it backfired, and now every woman in Sunnydale wants to make me her cuddle monkey, which may sound swell on paper, but...
jenny_calendar Rupert, we need to talk. Hey, Xander. Nice shirt. Look, Rupert, I know that you're angry at me, and I don't blame you, but I am not just gonna go away. I mean, I care far too much about you to... Have you been working out?
jenny_calendar Oh!
rupert_giles I cannot believe that you are fool enough to do something like this!
xander_harris Oh, no, I'm twice the fool it takes to do something like this.
rupert_giles Has, uh... Has Amy tried to reverse the spell?
xander_harris I get around Amy and all she wants to do is talk honeymoon plans.
jenny_calendar Rupert, maybe I need to talk to Xander alone.
rupert_giles Do you have any idea how serious this is? People under a-a love spell, Xander, are-are deadly. They lose all capacity for reason.
rupert_giles And if what you say is true and the entire female population is affected, I... Don't leave the library. I'll find Amy and see if we can put a stop to this thing.
jenny_calendar No!
buffy_summers Alone at last.
xander_harris Buff, give me a heart attack!
buffy_summers Oh, I'm gonna give you more than that.
xander_harris Buff, for the love of God, don't open that raincoat.
buffy_summers Come on! It's a party! Aren't you gonna open your present?
xander_harris It's not that I don't want to. Sometimes the remote impossible possibility that you might like me was all that sustained me. But not now. Not like this. This isn't real to you. You're only here because of a spell. I mean, if I thought you had one clue what it would mean to me... But you don't. So I can't.
buffy_summers So you're saying this is all a game?
xander_harris A game? I... No!
buffy_summers You make me feel this way, and then you reject me? What am I, a toy?
xander_harris Buffy, please calm down.
buffy_summers I'll calm down when you explain yourself!
amy_madison Get away from him. He's mine.
buffy_summers Oh, I don't think so. Xander, tell her.
xander_harris What? I, uh...
amy_madison He doesn't have to say. I know what his heart wants.
buffy_summers Funny, I know what your face wants.
buffy_summers What is this, you're two-timing me?
amy_madison Goddess Hecate, work thy will.
xander_harris Uh-oh.
amy_madison Before thee let the unclean thing crawl!
xander_harris Buffy! Oh, my God!
rupert_giles What, what just happened?
xander_harris Buffy.
rupert_giles Where is she?
rupert_giles Oh, my God!
amy_madison Why is she here?
xander_harris Can you focus for a minute? You just turned Buffy into a rat.
amy_madison Buffy can take care of herself. Why don't we go someplace private?
xander_harris Can you... I'm not going anywhere until you change her back.
jenny_calendar You heard him. So why don't you undo your little magic trick and get lost?
amy_madison Who made you Queen of the World? Well, you're old enough to be.
jenny_calendar Well, what can I say? I guess Xander's just too much man for the pimple squad.
amy_madison Goddess Hecate, to you I pray, with this...
xander_harris Would you quit with the Hecate?!
cordelia_chase Okay, what now? You don't like my locker combination?
harmony_kendall It's just not right. You never loved him. You just used him. You make me sick.
cordelia_chase Okay, Harmony, if you need to borrow my Midol, just ask.
rupert_giles You two, sit. And be quiet. We have to catch the Buffy rat.
xander_harris Ooo, there!
xander_harris Good Buffy. Just...
oz That kinda hurt.
xander_harris Kinda?! What was that for?
oz I was on the phone all night, listening to Willow cry about *you*. Now, I don't know exactly what happened, but I was left with a very strong urge to... hit you.
xander_harris I didn't touch her. I swear.
rupert_giles Xander! Where's Buffy?
xander_harris Amy turned her into a rat.
oz Oh.
rupert_giles I don't see her. If anything happens to her, I'll... Oh, just go home. Lock yourself away. You're only going to cause more problems here. Now, Amy, Jenny and I will, uh... try and break the spell. Oz, if, if you could aid us in, in finding, um... Buffy.
oz Sure. Absolutely.
rupert_giles Just go. Get out of my sight.
oz Buffy...
cordelia_chase What are you doing?! You guys are crazy!
harmony_kendall You thought you could do better, is that it?
cordelia_chase No, I...
cordette We'll knock that snotty attitude right out of you!
cordelia_chase Ow! Stop!
rupert_giles You must have botched the ritual so that Cordelia's necklace actually protected her from the spell. Th-th-that one should be easily reversible. W-w-where did you learn animal transformation?
amy_madison Why did you send Xander away? He needs me.
jenny_calendar That's a laugh.
amy_madison He loves me. We look into each other's souls.
jenny_calendar No one can love two people at once. What *we* have is real.
rupert_giles Instead of making me ill, why doesn't one of you try to help me?
amy_madison You have no idea what I'm going through.
rupert_giles I know it's not love. It's obsession. Selfish, banal obsession. Now, Xander has put himself in very great danger. If you cared at all about him, you'd help me save him, rather than wittering on about your feelings.
rupert_giles Now, let's get on with some work. Now, Jenny... Great!
xander_harris I think we... lost 'em.
willow_rosenberg I should've known I'd find you with her.
xander_harris Will... Come on, you don't wanna hurt me.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no? You don't know how hard this is for me. I love you so much! I'd rather see you dead than with that bitch.
harmony_kendall Get away from him! He's mine!
xander_harris Okay, now I really think we've lost them.
cordelia_chase Damn it, Xander, what's going on? Who died and made *you* Elvis?
xander_harris Buffy's house. Let's get inside. I'll explain later.
cordelia_chase Come on!
joyce_summers Xander, Cordelia, what...
cordelia_chase Yeah, hi.
joyce_summers What happened? Why are you all scratched up? Where's Buffy?
xander_harris She's, um... around.
joyce_summers Well, sit down and tell me about it. Why don't you run upstairs and grab some bandages out of the bathroom?
joyce_summers Let me, uh, get you something to drink. You in the mood for cold or hot?
xander_harris I, uh...
joyce_summers I think it's more of a *hot* night, don't you?
xander_harris Whatever.
joyce_summers Ooo, you are so tense. Mm.
cordelia_chase What are you doing? Make me yak!
joyce_summers Cordelia, go back upstairs. This is between us.
cordelia_chase Gross! I think not.
joyce_summers What are you doing? Hey! Get your hands off me!
cordelia_chase And keep your mom-aged mitts off my boyfriend. Former! Why has everyone gone insane?
xander_harris Insane? Is it so impossible for you to believe that other women find me attractive?
cordelia_chase The only way you could get girls to want you would be witchcraft.
xander_harris That is such a... Well, yeah, okay, good point.
cordelia_chase Oh, my God!
joyce_summers Xander, honey, let Joycie in. Hon, let Joycie in!
xander_harris Upstairs! Buffy's room!
joyce_summers Sweetheart...
xander_harris Good. The mob still hasn't found us. We should be safer up here.
angel Works in theory.
cordelia_chase Xander!
angel Where's Buffy?!
xander_harris Cordy, get outta here!
angel Perfect. I wanted to do something special for Buffy, actually to Buffy, but this is *so* much better!
angel If it's any consolation, I feel very close to you right now.
xander_harris Buffy, how...
drusilla Don't fret, kitten. Mummy's here.
angel I don't know what you're up to, Dru, but it *doesn't* amuse!
drusilla If you harm one hair on this boy's head...
angel You've gotta be kidding. Him?
drusilla Just because I finally found a *real* man...
angel I guess I really *did* drive you crazy.
drusilla Your face is a poem. I can read it.
xander_harris Really? It doesn't say 'spare me' by any chance?
drusilla Shhh. How do you feel about eternal life?
xander_harris We couldn't just start with a coffee? A movie, maybe?
frenzied_girl There he is! Get them!
jenny_calendar He's mine! Get off!
willow_rosenberg All you had to do was love me!
cordelia_chase No!
cordelia_chase Get out of the way! Move it! Get off him!
cordelia_chase Back off!
frenzied_girl I love you!
angel Ahh! Sorry, Dru. I guess you're not invited.
joyce_summers It's never gonna work for us, Xander. We have to end it.
oz Here, Buffy.
rupert_giles Right. Go on. You first.
xander_harris Gimme a nail!
cordelia_chase If we die in here I'm gonna kick your ass! I mean it!
xander_harris None of this would've happened if you hadn't broken up with me. But no, you're so desperate to be popular!
cordelia_chase Me? I'm not the one who embraced the black arts just to get the girls to like me. Well, congratulations, it worked!
xander_harris Would've worked fine, except your hide's so thick, not even magic can penetrate it!
cordelia_chase You mean the spell was for me?
frenzied_girl Oh, please let me touch you!
amy_madison Goddess of creatures great and small, I conjure thee to withdraw.
amy_madison Hecate, I hereby license thee to depart.
oz Buffy?
cordelia_chase Oh, my God!
xander_harris Stay behind me.
rupert_giles Um... Diana, goddess of love, be gone.
rupert_giles Hear no more thy siren's song.
cordelia_chase Get off!
cordelia_chase Get off me!
frenzied_girl What's going on? Where am I? What's going on?
buffy_summers Hi, Oz!
oz Hi.
buffy_summers I seem to be having a slight case of nudity here.
oz But you're not a rat. So call it an upside.
buffy_summers You think maybe you could get me some clothing?
oz Yes, I can. Just, uh... don't go anywhere.
buffy_summers Really not an issue.
joyce_summers What... What did we...
cordelia_chase Boy, that was the best scavenger hunt ever.
buffy_summers Scavenger hunt.
xander_harris Your mom seemed to buy it.
buffy_summers So she says. I think she's just so wigged at hitting on one of my friends that she's repressing. She's getting pretty good at that. I should probably start worrying.
xander_harris Well, I'm back to being incredibly unpopular.
buffy_summers It's better than everyone trying to ax-murder you, right?
xander_harris Mostly, but, uh... Willow won't even talk to me.
buffy_summers Any particular reason she should?
xander_harris How much groveling are we talking here?
buffy_summers Oh, a month, at least. Xander, come on, I mean... this is worse for her than anyone. She loved you before you invoked the great Roofie spirit. The rest of us...
xander_harris You remember, huh?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah. I remember coming on to you, I remember begging you to undress me... And then a sudden need for cheese. I also remember that you didn't.
xander_harris Need cheese?
buffy_summers Undress me. It meant a lot to me what you said.
xander_harris C'mon, Buffy, I couldn't take advantage of you like that. Okay, for a minute, it was touch and go there...
buffy_summers You came through. There might just be hope for you yet.
xander_harris Well, tell that to Cordelia.
buffy_summers You're on your own there.
harmony_kendall Cody Weinberg called me at home last night.
cordelia_chase Cody Weinberg? The one with the 350sl?
harmony_kendall The very one. Said he's thinking of asking me to the pledge dance on Thursday.
cordelia_chase That's so huge!
harmony_kendall Yeah, there's just two other girls he's gonna ask first, and if they refuse, then I'll...
harmony_kendall Watch it!
xander_harris Sorry.
harmony_kendall God! Y'know, I'm glad your mom stopped working at the drive-through long enough to dress you. Oh, that reminds me. Did you see Jennifer's backpack? It is *so* a crying...
cordelia_chase Harmony, shut up. Do you know what you are, Harmony? You're a sheep.
harmony_kendall I'm not a sheep.
cordelia_chase You're a sheep. All you ever do is what everyone else does just so you can say you did it first. And here I am, scrambling for your approval, when I'm *way* cooler than you are 'cause I'm *not* a sheep. I do what I wanna do, and I wear what I wanna wear. And you know what? I'll date whoever the hell I wanna date. No matter how lame he is.
cordelia_chase Oh, God! Oh, God!
xander_harris You're gonna be okay. Just keep walkin'.
cordelia_chase Oh, God, what have I done? They're never gonna speak to me again!
xander_harris Oh, sure, they are. If it helps, whenever we're around them you and I can fight a lot.
cordelia_chase You promise?
xander_harris You can pretty much count on it.
