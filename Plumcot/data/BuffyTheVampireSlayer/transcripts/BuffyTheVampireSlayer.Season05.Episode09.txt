dreg This dark spell I hold in my worthless hand is our gift to you, Glorificus...
glory Please, call me Glory.
tara_maclay What if she's something else altogether?
rupert_giles Something new, you mean?
tara_maclay Something old. So old it pre-dates the written word.
SECURITY_GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 Lady, whatever you are, please ... I have two daughters.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 The key ... is energy. My brethren sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn.
rupert_giles She has no idea.
buffy_summers No. She thinks she's my kid sister.
buffy_summers I have to take care of her.
DOCTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 Your mother has ... low-grade glioma. It's a brain tumor.
joyce_summers Listen you two, I know this creamed spinach is pretty delicious, but I promise, I won't be offended if you go out for some real food.
buffy_summers You kidding me? This is the good life. Relaxing in bed while people bring you food on trays.
dawn_summers I like the Jello.
joyce_summers Help yourself. There's something about food that moves by itself that gives me the heebie-jeebies.
dawn_summers It's good and wiggly. This girl at school told me that gelatin is made from ground-up cow's feet, and that if you eat Jello there's some cows out limping with no feet.
dawn_summers But I told her I'm sure they kill 'em before they take off their feet. Right?
buffy_summers You're the one who insisted on teaching her to talk.
joyce_summers Oh, hello, Dr. Kriegel, um, you know my girls, Buffy and Dawn.
dr_kriegel Yes, of course. You two are becoming part of the regular crew around here.
buffy_summers Just keeping her company.
dr_kriegel Good. Just be careful you don't wear her out.
joyce_summers Ohh, don't worry about that. I woke up exhausted, there's really no more exhausted to get.
dr_kriegel Well, maybe some good news will help. The blood work's come back from the lab, and everything seems fine. So, we've scheduled your surgery for day after tomorrow at ten in the morning.
dr_kriegel How's that sound to you?
joyce_summers Oh, well, I think they had me scheduled for volleyball, but, ah, we can work around it.
dr_kriegel All right. Joyce, you take care. Make sure you get some good solid rest. And I mean that.
joyce_summers Uhh, the day after tomorrow. I don't think I can stand to stay here another two days just waiting.
buffy_summers Waiting? Gimme a break, we got, we got tons to do.
dawn_summers We have soap operas to watch and trashy magazines to read.
buffy_summers And an adjustable bed to fiddle with. That alone will keep me busy for four hours or so.
joyce_summers Oh, I really don't need you to stay here, Buffy. I know you've got patrolling to do.
buffy_summers Not tonight. Tonight I have mom-taking-care-of to do. And besides, Riley's filling in for me with the others. I'm sure they have everything under control.
xander_harris Human chest! Human chest!
rupert_giles Sorry!
rupert_giles My god, what a rough night.
willow_rosenberg I just did two of 'em! Yay on me!
willow_rosenberg That was pretty cool. Except the part where I was all terrified and ... and now my knees are all dizzy.
xander_harris Not so much a big success night for me. But I think I should get points just for showing up. Unlike some Riley Finn who shall remain unnamed.
rupert_giles Yes, that was disappointing. Things would have been easier if he'd been here.
willow_rosenberg Oh, piffle, who needs him when I'm dusting two at a ti- Whoops. Maybe it would've been good if ... he'd shown up.
rupert_giles Perhaps he forgot.
willow_rosenberg Care package! Special delivery for the Summers girls. Now, let's see what I have in this sack of mine. Oh, I feel just like Santa Claus, except thinner and younger and female and, well, Jewish. This is an extra-special gift for your mom, that I know she'll need. A beer hat! See, i-it's got cup holders, and a straw that goes directly into your mouth, and you can fill it with other stuff than beer. And somehow, when I was in the store this seemed like the most important idea and now there's the whole part where I'm crazy.
joyce_summers It's perfect. Thank you, Willow. You're very sweet.
willow_rosenberg Now, let's see, who's next? Dawn, I believe I have something in here for you...
buffy_summers Headache?
joyce_summers Just a little one. A biggish little one. I'm fine! Go on, what else is in that sack of goodies, Willow?
willow_rosenberg All right. Dawn, to keep you busy.
dawn_summers Ooh, spells! Thank you, Willow!
buffy_summers You got her a book on spells. The girl who can break things by just looking at them, now has a book to teach her to ... break things by looking at them?
willow_rosenberg Oh, well, it doesn't actually have spells in it. Just history, and anecdotes, stuff like that.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy- I have this for you.
buffy_summers Homework? Oh. I don't believe in tiny Jewish Santa any more.
willow_rosenberg And a yo-yo.
buffy_summers Thank you.
willow_rosenberg The book is just in case you get a chance to look it over.
willow_rosenberg We're doing World War One now. The last exam was really pretty easy, just underlying causes and trench foot. So it should be no hassle to make it up-
buffy_summers I don't even know if I'm gonna take that exam.
joyce_summers I'd rip it in half and stick it in bed with me!
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers You know, I think I'm gonna take a little rest now.
buffy_summers Okay. We'll be right outside if you need us.
dawn_summers What was she talking about? I mean, that was weird.
willow_rosenberg She's gonna be fine.
buffy_summers It's okay. I'm sorry, the doctor spoke to me, and uh, I should have told you. Um, the, the thing that's pressing on her brain, sometimes it, it might make her say weird things.
dawn_summers Does she know she's saying them?
buffy_summers Not really. It's sort of like a flash, you know, but you saw her two seconds afterward. She was normal.
willow_rosenberg And after the operation, no more pressing. She'll be all normal all the time.
dawn_summers Is that right?
buffy_summers Hey, Santa doesn't lie.
buffy_summers Oh, excuse me.
older_nightwatchman Careful, the facts say a-a picnic is in order.
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 What is that thing?
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 There-there's no data. There's no pictures on this one there!
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 What is the data? There's no one in there.
dawn_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers Come on, honey. Don't worry about it.
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 I'm going home? Home? Home, home, home.
dawn_summers What's wrong with him? Is it like Mom? A thing in his head?
buffy_summers I don't think so, I-I think it's, it's different. Don't, don't worry about it.
ben I guess I missed that, was he bothering you?
buffy_summers Hey Ben, uh, this is my friend Willow.
ben Hi.
willow_rosenberg Hi.
buffy_summers And, uh, yeah, the crazy man was a little ... you know, crazy, but it's okay. Are they really gonna send him home?
ben Don't get me started. The mental ward's booked beyond capacity, literally nowhere to put them, so the ones with families, they're letting 'em go home. Like his family's gonna be able to take care of him. He has to have someone to watch him 24-7! What was he saying to you?
dawn_summers I-
buffy_summers Oh, he was just babbling.
willow_rosenberg You know what's weird?
tara_maclay Japanese commercials are weird.
willow_rosenberg Yes. And also, you know some of the stars we're looking at ... don't even exist any more? In the time that it takes for their light to reach us, they've died. Exploded. Poof.
tara_maclay Were, um ... were things rough at the hospital?
willow_rosenberg You know, I used to love to look up at them when I was little. They're supposed to make you feel all insignificant, but ... they made me feel like ... like I was in space ... part of the stars. There's ... Canis Minor ... and ... and Cassiopeia.
tara_maclay And the big pineapple.
willow_rosenberg Hmm. You know, I'm not sure I remember that one.
tara_maclay Oh, it's, it's a major one. See those three bright stars right over there?
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
tara_maclay And see those stars along there? That's the bottom of the pineapple.
willow_rosenberg It's big.
tara_maclay Hence the name. The real ones never made sense to me, I ... sort of have my own.
willow_rosenberg Teach me.
tara_maclay See those stars over there? Short man looking uncomfortable.
tara_maclay Uh... Moose getting a sponge bath. Umm... little pile o'crackers. Tha-that was a bit of a stretch. You do it. What would you call ... mm, that one?
willow_rosenberg Hmm, let's see.
willow_rosenberg A huge flaming meteor about to crash into something!
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 I know what I said. I said-I said I won't go away far. A person needs to respect a man.
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 And then it says ... that... the facts says... he's got to go take a walk and get some fresh air and find some fresh spaces.
GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 ...and some fresh space! And needs to walk to get ... to get where he's going.
joyce_summers This thing doesn't work! It isn't working!
buffy_summers I'm sure they heard you.
joyce_summers I bet it's not even hooked up to anything. Just like the push buttons at the crosswalk that are supposed to make the signal change.
buffy_summers I'm sure someone's on - What, the push buttons aren't hooked up to anything?
joyce_summers Oh, tell him, Buffy. Tell him, okay?
buffy_summers Look, Dr. Kriegel, we wanna go home.
dr_kriegel Well, of course. You can come back and visit your mother first thing in the morning.
buffy_summers No. We. I-I mean, all of us. My mom too.
dr_kriegel Oh. Well, I understand that, but it's not necessarily the first thing I'd recommend.
joyce_summers I can't! I-I can't stay here waiting for two days for this operation, I just can't. It makes my head hurt to be here, can't you tell that?
dr_kriegel Joyce, there's no reason to get upset.
joyce_summers No reason to get upset? Oh, right, sorry, I must just think there is because of my brain tumor!
buffy_summers Here, Dawn, why don't you get something from the machine?
joyce_summers I-I'm sorry I said that, I'm just tired.
buffy_summers I know. Listen, Doctor, I don't see why we can't take her home, you know, just until... I-I mean, wouldn't it be better for her to rest someplace where she felt safe and comfortable?
dr_kriegel Even if it would mean some work for you, taking care of her?
joyce_summers Oh, thank god.
buffy_summers I'll do it, anything.
dr_kriegel There are medications to administer, I'd have to go over those with you, and I'd need for you to check her vitals, watch her pretty closely. I'm afraid you won't get a lot of sleep.
buffy_summers I'm not much of a sleep person anyway.
joyce_summers Can we go now? Let's go now!
buffy_summers Oh, hold on! Lemme get all the medications and all the instructions on how to do everything.
dr_kriegel She's right. Let's do this right. We don't wanna forget anything.
riley_finn Everyone stay close. I'm glad you called me in on this.
xander_harris Glad you answered.
riley_finn Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about last time. Heard I missed out on some fun.
xander_harris Oh, yeah, fun was had. Also frolic, merriment, and near-death hijinks.
riley_finn Look, there it is.
willow_rosenberg Wow. We have meteorite.
anya Is it hot?
anya 'Cause, uh, if there's radiation, you could like go all sterile.
riley_finn No, it's not hot. It's warm. And broken. It's sort of-
rupert_giles Hollow.
riley_finn Yeah.
anya So, uh, we're all thinking the same thing, right?
xander_harris Festive pinata? Delicious candy?
willow_rosenberg Something evil crashed to earth in this and then broke out and ... slithered away to do badness.
rupert_giles In all fairness, we don't really know about the slithered part.
anya Oh, no. I'm sure it frisked about like a fluffy lamb.
tara_maclay Let's look around. Maybe we can figure out where it went.
willow_rosenberg It went here!
riley_finn No pulse.
anya Yep, the space lamb got 'im.
xander_harris I don't see any marks on him.
willow_rosenberg I-I know him! He, he was at the hospital, a mental patient. They released him today.
rupert_giles Uh, Riley, what are you doing?
riley_finn I'm not sure, there's something...
riley_finn Oh, that might be toxic, don't touch it.
xander_harris Oh yeah, touching it was my first impulse. Luckily I've moved on to my second, which involves dry-heaving and running like hell. Oh, man, does that smell.
anya So what do we do now?
willow_rosenberg We can't call Buffy. I wanna call Buffy!
tara_maclay You can't. She's got ... life stuff. That has to come first.
willow_rosenberg So, so we'll just figure this out ourselves. We're experienced.
anya Yes, 'cause it seems like we're always dealing with creatures from outer space. Except that we don't ever do that.
riley_finn This is definitely new territory.
rupert_giles Perhaps we should explore a bit more, head into the woods a bit.
xander_harris Who votes research?
willow_rosenberg Research.
riley_finn Yeah, I think that's a good call. There could have been some other cases like this. I'm gonna stay here, examine the body some more, look around a little bit.
xander_harris Yeah, don't do anything hunterly.
riley_finn No, no, I'm just not great at research, which I'm sure you guys figured out. I like me a good crime scene.
rupert_giles Um, give us a call if you need help.
riley_finn Believe me, something jumps out at me in the dark ... you'll hear me even without the phone. Call me if you learn anything.
willow_rosenberg You got it.
willow_rosenberg I don't wanna be the one who finds the bodies any more.
riley_finn I need to speak to the man at the desk. This is A ... this is Riley Finn. You have an Agent Miller, Graham Miller, he'll tell you who ... Yes. Emergency frequency.
PATIENT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 Cold. Cold.
PATIENT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 Wait! You can't go! Don't you be that kind of barn owl! Please! Please don't go! Please!
PATIENT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 Please! Please! Please don't-
PATIENT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode09 I can't see you! I can't see you! I can't see you!
dr_kriegel Well, I guess we're all set then.
dr_kriegel You've got my home phone number, pager number, and here, these are the medications I talked to you about. The sedative and so forth, painkillers.
buffy_summers Right. No problem.
dr_kriegel Now, if this is gonna be too much for you, we can make your mom perfectly comfortable here.
buffy_summers No. No, no, I-I got this. We really, really appreciate-
joyce_summers You look just like your father when he cries.
buffy_summers I-I told you she's been-
dr_kriegel I know. Joyce? Joyce. We're all done here. Why don't you take your girls home now.
joyce_summers Yes. Yes, thank you. Thank you for all your help, doctor.
dr_kriegel I'll see you in a couple of days.
joyce_summers Oh, let's get the hell outta here.
buffy_summers Here we go.
joyce_summers Oh, it's nice to be home.
dawn_summers Do you wanna go in to bed, Mom?
joyce_summers Buffy, no, that light is too bright. It's too bright.
buffy_summers Oh, okay, okay!
joyce_summers It's too bright. Buffy, it hurts. It hurts, it hurts my eyes.
buffy_summers It's off, it's off. You know what, why don't you turn off the lights in the living room, and I will take you upstairs and we'll shut off all the lights up there. Okay? Come on.
major_ellis You Finn?
riley_finn Yeah.
major_ellis Major Ellis. I'm in charge of this op. What's the situation, just the one civilian casualty?
riley_finn That I know of. This way.
graham_miller You found a stiff in the woods and called us in? Don't you usually call your girlfriend for this kind of thing?
riley_finn I wouldn't touch that stuff in his mouth if I were you.
major_ellis Toxic?
riley_finn No, just messy. Guy seemed to have simply choked on the stuff. Near as I can tell, it's some kind of protein alkaloid.
major_ellis Does this fit the profile of any Sub-T you're familiar with?
riley_finn Not subterrestrial, Major. Extraterrestrial. It came outta that.
major_ellis Miller, set the trackers for a protein signature.
graham_miller Yes sir.
riley_finn No good, Major. This alkaloid's breaking down at an accelerated rate. It's dissolving too fast to track.
major_ellis You got a better idea?
riley_finn Thing came from space. Gotta be some trace radiation.
major_ellis We have Geiger counters in the packs.
riley_finn Shouldn't be too much background gamma noise out here.
major_ellis Break 'em out.
dawn_summers Mom?
buffy_summers Oh, my-
buffy_summers Mom, wha-what are you doing?
joyce_summers I'm making breakfast. And you shouldn't eat any more, you're disgustingly fat.
joyce_summers Oh, Buffy, I don't know what I'm doing.
buffy_summers You just need some rest. We'll put you back to bed.
buffy_summers Okay, here we go. That will help you sleep. Come on, let's get you all tucked into bed.
joyce_summers Don't touch me! You - you thing!
dawn_summers Mom, please!
joyce_summers Get away from me! You're nothing, you're, you're a shadow!
buffy_summers Mom-
joyce_summers I don't know what you are or how you got here!
buffy_summers Mom, it's Dawn.
joyce_summers Dawn? Honey, what's wrong?
buffy_summers She's .. just tired. We all are. Come on, go to sleep. I'll check in on you in a little bit.
dawn_summers She hates me.
buffy_summers No.
dawn_summers She called me a thing.
buffy_summers She loves you. Okay? She's not herself. I told you what the doctor said about the tumor.
dawn_summers No, not just Mom. People. They keep saying weird stuff about me.
buffy_summers Are you talking about the man in the hospital?
dawn_summers He called me a thing too. And there was another one. Weird guy outside the magic shop. He said I didn't belong. He said I wasn't real. Why does everybody keep doing that? What's wrong with me?
buffy_summers Nothing. It's not you. I think there's something that happens in people's brains when there's something wrong. It's, it's like a short-circuit ... and it makes them feel like nothing's real except for them. That's all it is.
buffy_summers Look, it is not you. Okay? And if anyone says anything like that to you again, don't listen. Even if it's Mom.
dawn_summers I hate it.
buffy_summers I know. Just don't listen.
xander_harris Look at how teeny Mercury is compared to, like, Saturn. Whereas in contrast, the cars of the same name-
rupert_giles Xander, please, we have work to do here.
xander_harris I still don't get why we had to come here to get info about a killer snot monster.
rupert_giles Because it's a killer snot monster from outer space. I did not say that.
rupert_giles Demons enter our world in all sorts of ways, this one came from above.
xander_harris And the university library's astronomy section is the home of aboveness. Got it. Hey, take in the study material, too.
tara_maclay We've been scouring all the international periodicals for any other meteorite landings in the last week.
anya Big zippo.
rupert_giles Well, then it would appear that the world is not being invaded.
tara_maclay I'm pretty pleased about that.
willow_rosenberg Uh, guys? I've got some stuff. The most recent meteoric anomaly was the Tunguska blast in Russia in 1917. Some witnesses claimed the meteor was hollow.
xander_harris Hmm. Maybe with a chewy demon center like ours.
rupert_giles How far back does this list of anomalies go?
willow_rosenberg Pretty far. Back to the Queller impact in the twelfth century.
tara_maclay The what?
willow_rosenberg Queller. I-I don't know why they call it that, it didn't hit a place called Queller or anything. It landed just outside of Reykjavik in Iceland.
xander_harris Wait, I just saw... Queller. Quell ... here, here! Primitive people used to believe that the moon was a cause of insanity. Sometimes they would pray to the moon to send a special meteor to fix the problem the moon had caused. These meteors were expected to *quell* the madmen.
tara_maclay The man in the woods. He was a mental patient.
xander_harris And he got pretty well ... quelled.
willow_rosenberg Okay, I'm looking in history right now. It says in the Middle Ages there were these sweeping plagues of madness. People were losing their marbles everywhere. But then it would suddenly subside. And these dates look pretty close. Like-like maybe it happened after each one of the meteor events.
rupert_giles So something emerged from the meteors ... and quelled the madmen.
xander_harris Meteor go boom, crazy guy goes bye-bye.
tara_maclay Xander's little book made it sound like this Queller thing had to be summoned. So ... who summoned it?
xander_harris Who else? My money's on Glory, our resident beastie summoner.
willow_rosenberg We should call Buffy. E-except we can't call Buffy. Can we?
rupert_giles No, but we better call Riley.
riley_finn Queller demon?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, that's our perp. It's sort of a scavenger that can be summoned to kill-
riley_finn Crazy people.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, how'd you know?
riley_finn 'Cause I've got five corpses here at the mental ward at Sunnydale Memorial.
willow_rosenberg You're at the hospital? Oh, listen, Riley, I ... I saw Buffy's mom earlier, and she was acting kinda ... wacky. Insane wacky, if you know what I mean?
riley_finn It's okay. Joyce was released earlier today. That intern, um, Ben, told me. They're safe at home.
willow_rosenberg Oh, good. A-and the thing, the Queller, is it still there?
riley_finn We - I think I've got it cornered in the air ducts.
riley_finn Look, Willow, keep at what you're doing. Call me if you find out how I can kill this thing.
willow_rosenberg Well, okay, but shouldn't we come help- Oooookay.
joyce_summers I wish that someone had bothered to tell me that there would be tennis being played!
joyce_summers I just didn't know. Those eyes ... Those eyes, they're like gasoline puddles! Tell me. Tell me because I need to know why, why are you staring at me like that?
joyce_summers What are you asking me? You are asking me, aren't you? Is this a test? And if this counts for the final grade, I need to know now! Okay, there are teachers, and they put this on the syllabus, but they do not stare down at you, they do not cling, they do not look down on you....
joyce_summers You know there are people who are nice, and they give you presents, even when you are bad.
joyce_summers Does someone know you're here? Because they should have told you that at the gate. You are *not* supposed to be here. I need to rest now. I-I don't like the way you're staring at me! Did they tell you that at the gate?
joyce_summers Stop staring at me, I don't like it!
graham_miller Trail stops here, edge of the parking lot.
major_ellis It stops?
riley_finn A car. It hitched a ride. Probably underneath. So much for containment.
major_ellis So some poor mental patient checks out of here today, drives away with this thing, took it right to his own home.
riley_finn Checked out today.
major_ellis Get me a list of all patients discharged in the last 24 hours.
riley_finn No. I know where it's going. We've gotta move, now!
joyce_summers I'm going to close my eyes, and when I open them, you are going to go away.
joyce_summers Get off me!
dawn_summers Buffy!!
dawn_summers BUFFY!
buffy_summers What? What is it?
dawn_summers There's something out there, Buffy. It's after Mom!
buffy_summers You guys stay in here. Don't leave this room.
joyce_summers It's okay, my baby. It's okay.
buffy_summers Spike?
spike Yeah. Listen, uh, did you hear a noise?
buffy_summers What the hell are you doing in my house?
spike Right then, caught me. Your basement's full of junk. And me being in need of, uh, junk...
buffy_summers You were stealing?
spike Well, yeah. Can't exactly work the counter at Burger Barn, can I?
buffy_summers Wait, are those pictures of me?
spike Buffy!
riley_finn Are you okay?
spike You just missed a real nice time.
buffy_summers It's gone. I killed it.
joyce_summers Oh god.
dawn_summers It's gone? You promise?
buffy_summers I promise. Everything's all right. Everything's all right.
dreg It's strange. A body might ask what exactly it is you think you're doing. He might ask what all this was meant to accomplish. Because to a humble postulant, it looks like chaos. Like unnecessary attention drawn where it ought not to be.
ben Get out!
dreg Sir.
dreg Sir, forgive me. I just want to understand. Why summon the Queller?
ben What do you think? Because I'm cleaning up Glory's mess. Just like I've done my whole damn life.
joyce_summers Buffy, uh, I'm gonna ask you something, a-and if I'm, if I'm being crazy you just tell me, okay?
buffy_summers You got it.
joyce_summers The other day ... well, actually, I'm, I'm not sure when, the days seem to all bleed together...
buffy_summers It's not important.
joyce_summers No, I guess it isn't. I do know I was ... pretty out of it, and I had ... not-not a dream ... exactly, more like I had this ... knowledge, i-it just came to me like ....truth, you know? Even though it didn't seem...possible, even though I shouldn't even think such things.
buffy_summers What?
joyce_summers That Dawn...
joyce_summers She's not ... mine, is she?
buffy_summers No.
joyce_summers She's ... she does belong to us, though.
buffy_summers Yes, she does.
joyce_summers And she's important. To the world. Precious. As precious as you are to me.
joyce_summers Then we have to take care of her. Buffy, promise me. If anything happens, if I don't come through this-
buffy_summers Mom-
joyce_summers No, listen to me. No matter what she is, she still feels like my daughter. I have to know that you'll take care of her, that you'll keep her safe. That you'll love her like I love you.
buffy_summers I promise.
joyce_summers Good. Good.
joyce_summers Oh, my sweet brave Buffy. What would I do without you?
