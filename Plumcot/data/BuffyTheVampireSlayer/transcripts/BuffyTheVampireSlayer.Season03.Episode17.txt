buffy_summers Well.
angel Well.
buffy_summers That was very ... artistic.
angel Yeah.
buffy_summers Wasn't what I expected. I've never actually seen... Well, from the title I thought it was about food.
angel Well there was food.
buffy_summers Right. The, the scene with the, the food. So, feel like getting some hot chocolate? Or some cold shower?
angel I'm sorry. I wanted to take you out somewhere fun. It's been a long time since I've been to the movies. They changed.
buffy_summers A little scary. And a little not, which is also scary. I'm sorry. I just, I don't like getting you worked up like that. We can't actually do any of those things. You'd lose your soul. Besides, I don't even own a kimono.
angel Buffy, you don't have to worry about me.
buffy_summers Just don't like to rub your nose in it. Suddenly wondering where that expression comes from.
angel Look, I don't need to see movies to get worked up. Just being around you does that just fine. Doesn't mean that I'm gonna lose control, that I'm going to be frustrated around you. It feels nice, just to feel.
buffy_summers It doesn't drive you crazy, when we're close?
angel Watch this. See? Safe as houses.
faith Check out the lust bunnies.
buffy_summers Patrol?
angel Council has you back on active duty?
faith Finally. They want us down by Mercer.
buffy_summers Okay. Goodnight.
angel I'll see you soon.
faith Don't worry, big guy. Just keeping her warm for you.
faith Gotta tell you, B. The willpower thing, nice job.
buffy_summers Thanks.
faith But, the close but no cigar thing with Angel. I don't know if I could handle, you know, the way you're not handling it.
buffy_summers Faith, when it comes to Angel, do me a favor. Duck!
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Ow! Ooh! What are you, nuts? Going around punching people?
buffy_summers People?
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 So what, I'm a demon. That makes it okay?
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Hold it, whoa! Stake me now, and you never find out what I got for ya, huh? Think about it. Demon seeks Slayers, highly unusual?
faith Talk fast.
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 How would you like to get your hands on the Books of Ascension?
buffy_summers Never heard of 'em.
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Books of Ascension. Very powerful works and I'm not talking about the prose. They deal with some, ah, dark stuff. And the Mayor would hate for somebody to get ahold before he, ah, well you know.
buffy_summers Don't know. Before he what?
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Hey, hey, read 'em and weep. That's all I got to say. Tomorrow, I get the books. Meet me here and if the price is right, well I give the books to you.
buffy_summers Not really looking to trade with a demon.
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 And if this were still a barter economy, that would be a problem. I want cash, princess, five large for the whole set.
faith So you can buy, I'm guessing here, some skin care products.
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Plane ticket. Out of the Hellmouth before its adios, Slayer Loco. So, five G's, what do you say?
faith I think Die Fiend sums it up, wouldn't you say.
buffy_summers Oh, let him go. I don't think he falls into the deadly threat to humanity category.
faith A demon's a demon.
buffy_summers I'd like to know about these Books of Ascension. Anything that would pin the Mayor down would be great.
faith Yeah. It'd be great.
mayor_richard_wilkins And what exactly did this demon look like?
faith Demonic?
mayor_richard_wilkins Ah. And you say he has the Books of Ascension, or will soon, and he was, what, willing to sell them?
faith That's what I said.
mayor_richard_wilkins Hmm. You know what I wish? I wish you'd pull your hair back. I know, I know, fashion's not exactly my thing, but, gosh darn it, you know, you've got such a nice face. I can't understand why you hide it.
faith Yeah, sure. Whatever. It's just a matter of time before this demon guy is gonna spill. Then Buffy and the superfriends are gonna...
mayor_richard_wilkins You know, you worry too much for a girl for your age. That's unnecessary stress. Luckily, I've got just the thing.
mayor_richard_wilkins There you go. Now, first you load up on calcium. Then find this demon, kill the heck out of him, and bring the books to me.
faith And if Buffy gets to him first?
mayor_richard_wilkins Oh, well. Frankly I don't like to think about that. I like good, positive, up thoughts. If you fail me in that way. Well, you know, replacing Mr. Trick was chore enough. Oh, come on, don't worry. Drink up. There's nothing uncool about healty teeth and bones.
wesley_wyndampryce And you say this demon wanted cash? That's very unusual.
rupert_giles Demons after money. Whatever happened to the still beating heart of a virgin? No one has any standards anymore.
buffy_summers Well, he said the books were worth the price.
xander_harris What's this Ascenscion mean?
rupert_giles I'm not sure.
wesley_wyndampryce No, not really a common term in demonology.
willow_rosenberg Ooh ooh! The Marenschadt Text. I think in the section on genocide, they mention Ascenscion.
buffy_summers Well, we have a winner.
xander_harris And, more importantly, two losers.
rupert_giles Where did you find that volume?
willow_rosenberg In the top of your book cabinet with the stuff you try to keep hidden.
xander_harris Hidden? Are there any engravings I should know about? Uh, frolicking nymphs of some kind?
willow_rosenberg No. Just magic secrets Giles doesn't think I'm ready for.
rupert_giles Ah, yes, yes, here we are. There's a reference here to the journal of Desmond Kane, pastor of a town called Sharpsville. May 26, 1723. Tomorrow is the Ascenscion. God help us all. It was the last anyone heard.
wesley_wyndampryce Of Kane?
rupert_giles Of Sharpsville. The town more or less disappeared.
buffy_summers So Ascenscion possibly not a love-in.
rupert_giles I think you should meet with this demon, Buffy.
buffy_summers Yeah? Anybody got five thousand dollars?
cordelia_chase I have something important to ask you.
xander_harris Important? Let's start calculating those odds, people.
cordelia_chase What are you doing Friday night?
wesley_wyndampryce Uh, I, uh, as always my sacred duty as a Watcher prevents me from, ah... Why?
cordelia_chase I have a paper to write for English and you're English, so I thought ... What? Is it so wrong to be getting an insider's perspective? I study best in a good restaurant, around eightish? Think it over?
xander_harris And on the day the words flimsy excuse were redefined, we stood in awe and watched.
wesley_wyndampryce Right! Books of Ascenscion, Mayor, slaughter. Tell you what. Why don't we try to find this demon sooner rather than later? Perhaps persuade him to lend us the books free of charge.
buffy_summers I think Faith might be useful in that persuasion part.
wesley_wyndampryce I imagine so. Where is Faith anyway?
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Hey, Slayer! You know, I wasn't expecting company. Give me a minute and I'll have the place tidied up for you.
faith You got the books?
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Well, that depends. You got my money?
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 You're tough in negotiations and I respect that. Check 'em out. Now ah, that is quality merchandise. That's worth five grand easy.
faith Books of Ascenscion.
Demon#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 Mm hmm. Original editions and everything. Uh, great condition. Okay, it's a little worn on one spine, some slight foxing, but otherwise, perfect. Now, the five grand, it's ah, you know, negotiable.
faith I don't like to haggle.
angel Faith.
faith Angel. I got nowhere else to go. Look, I hate asking for help, but I'm asking, cause, uh, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. The real bad kind.
angel It's okay.
faith No, it's a couple of county lines over from okay, believe me.
angel Look, just talk. Come on. Start from the beginning.
faith Mind if I skip past the 'mom never loved me' part and get right to it? I'm scaring myself.
angel I know the feeling.
faith That's why I came to you. I don't want to get all twelve steppy, but remember when you told me that killing people would make me feel like some kind of god? I think I just came down to earth. It's not human if that's what you're thinking. Not that that makes me feel any better or this guy any less dead.
angel Faith, you need help. You can't do this alone.
faith I know. For real now, I'm scared. Scared of what I am, what I'm turning into. Cold-blooded straight up killer. Like you.
angel Not like me. I didn't have a choice. But you do. You can stop this.
faith Believe me, I don't want to end up the way everybody said I would, dead or alone or a loser.
angel No, you don't have to.
faith I don't know. Maybe it's too late for me.
angel It's not.
faith Angel, I'm so scared.
angel It's alright, shh, it's okay.
angel Whoa. Faith, I, look, I can be here for you. But not like that, alright? I'm with Buffy.
faith Buffy, yeah. I didn't mean it like that. Maybe I did, but I wouldn't press it. You love her, don't you.
angel I love her.
faith Good for you. The two of you, you're lucky. Friends?
angel Yeah, we're friends.
faith Then I'm lucky too. I'd better go.
angel Where?
faith I need to cool down. Spend some time alone. Don't worry about me. You've been a big help. Just knowing somebody cares. Hey, I know I shouldn't be asking this, but do you think if things were different that things between you and me would be different, too?
angel We'll never know.
faith Right. How could we?
angel Take care of yourself.
faith Lifetime of practice.
faith It's not like I wasn't trying, okay?
mayor_richard_wilkins Hey, there's no need to convince me. I'm sure you gave it your level best. I just don't understand what that boy could be thinking?
faith Try Buffy Summers, like in a big, fat, one track way.
mayor_richard_wilkins Hey, come on, don't be discouraged. You're a bright, young, energetic girl with a whole life ahead of her. And I won't tolerate brooding. So you couldn't give him that one moment of true happiness.
faith I was thinking more along the lines of a long weekend, but okay.
mayor_richard_wilkins And he spurns your advances. So be it. There's more than one way to skin a cat. And I happen to know that's factually true. We want to take Angel's soul away. If we can't do it by giving him happiness, well, by golly, we'll just have to do it in the most painful way imaginable.
wesley_wyndampryce Find anything?
rupert_giles Six course banquet of nothing with a scoop of sod-all as a palate closer.
wesley_wyndampryce I've had no better luck. There must be something about this Ascescion somewhere.
rupert_giles Perhaps I should contact the Council, maybe run a search...
wesley_wyndampryce No. I don't, uh, it should be I that ... The Council isn't entirely aware that I'm letting you work for me um, with me. I don't think they'd be very happy at the idea of the two of us collaborating.
rupert_giles Well I wasn't about to burst into glorious song about it myself. Why don't you call?
wesley_wyndampryce I think the most expedient plan would be to find these Books of Ascenscion themselves. Buffy, you and Faith must find this demon, and soon.
buffy_summers Well, I'll go back to the scene, see if I can track him.
wesley_wyndampryce Wait for Faith.
buffy_summers That could be hours. The girl makes Godot look punctual. I'll just go myself.
wesley_wyndampryce Buffy, this is a job for the both of you. This demon could be anywhere.
wesley_wyndampryce If these books are important as he says, he has good reason to hide. Finding him is going to be extremely difficult.
xander_harris Found your demon.
buffy_summers Fashion tip, Wes. Mouth looks better closed.
xander_harris Got the address. I beat it out of Willy the snitch personally.
buffy_summers You beat up Willy?
xander_harris Sure! Well, actually, let's just say I applied some pressure. Or more accurately, that I asked politely, and then, uh, okay, I bribed him.
buffy_summers How much?
xander_harris Twenty-eight bucks. Does the Council reimburse for that kind of stuff?
rupert_giles Did you get a receipt?
xander_harris Damn.
buffy_summers I know this. It's down by the bus station. Not the nicest part of town.
rupert_giles Again. See, no standards. I mean, any self-respecting demon should be living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.
buffy_summers I'll remember to mention that.
faith Mention what? Where we going, girlfriend?
buffy_summers Actually, I can handle this one solo.
faith Why should you get to have all the fun? Share, share, that's fair, right?
buffy_summers Right. Got our demon.
faith Oh, well, let's go look him up.
xander_harris Is it me or did it just get really cold in here?
buffy_summers Faith, careful.
faith Right.
buffy_summers Missed you last night.
faith Yeah, I was patrolling. No shortage of scum you gotta watch in Sunnydale, right?
buffy_summers So I've heard.
buffy_summers Looks like somebody got here first.
faith Betting they got the books, too. Some hit.
buffy_summers This wasn't just a hit. This was somebody's idea of a party.
faith Maybe the guy put up a fight. We gotta get going. Come on, nothing we can do here now. You coming?
mayor_richard_wilkins Mint? Didn't think so. Well, scheduling a man of your talents is quite the chore, I'll tell you. Between the chanting and the sacrifice, oh, my golf game is shot. But heeere you are. You know why I've summoned you. Can you do it? Need anything from me?
Mage#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 You have risked great danger in calling on me. The deadliest magics are needed to rob this creature of its soul.
mayor_richard_wilkins Big job alright.
Mage#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 And so it shall be done.
mayor_richard_wilkins Oh, that's just swell. Listen, you sure you don't want any? Cause they're, they're low calorie. Okay.
willow_rosenberg Are you okay? You seem a little on edge. Is there anything that's wrong?
buffy_summers It's nothing. It's nothing. Alright, alright, stop with the third degree. It's Faith.
willow_rosenberg What about her?
buffy_summers I went to Angel's last night and Faith was there. They looked sort of intimate.
willow_rosenberg No way. I know what you're thinking and no way!
buffy_summers You're right. Faith would never do that.
willow_rosenberg Faith would totally do that. Faith was built to do that. She's the do that girl.
buffy_summers Comfort, remember comfort, here?
willow_rosenberg I mean, please, does Angel come up to Faith's standards for a guy? Let's see, is he breathing?
buffy_summers Actually, no.
willow_rosenberg But Buffy, Angel. There's no way he would ever do that. I mean, you're the only thing in the world to him.
buffy_summers Sometimes I wonder. Angel and Faith have a lot in common. And there's so much he doesn't tell me.
willow_rosenberg But it's so clear the way he feels about you. Buffy, I too know the love of a taciturn man and you have to look at their actions.
buffy_summers I was.
willow_rosenberg Well, what did he say?
buffy_summers Say? You mean when I straightforwardly asked him what was going on?
willow_rosenberg So you bailed?
buffy_summers I couldn't. I mean, not ...
willow_rosenberg Enough. Stop with the crazy. Go talk to Angel.
buffy_summers But I ...
willow_rosenberg No. Go. I give you leave to go.
buffy_summers Thank you.
angel Faith.
faith Hey. Sorry to bust in uninvited.
angel What do you want.
faith Look, I'm not so good at apologies. Mostly because I think the world's out to screw me so I'm generally more owed than owing. But I've been thinking about last night and I want you to know I was really sorry.
angel It's alright, Faith.
faith No, it's not alright. Yeah, I was freaked and needed somebody, but you're with Buffy. I should know better.
angel Yeah, okay.
faith You don't trust me.
angel It's not that.
faith Hey, no problem. Join the club.
angel Look, Faith. I know what you're going through, alright, and how hard it can be. It's important you have somebody who's been there and who understands what you're going through. Look, I want to trust you.
faith Chump.
angel Faith!
faith I wanted to do this the old-fashioned way, but hey, your loss. Lucky I've got some tricks Buffy don't know yet.
angel You don't have to do this.
faith I know, but it's fun. Now relax, it'll be over soon.
angel Thanks, so much. It's good to have the taste of a Slayer back in my mouth. It's like cigarettes, you know, just when I thought I'd quit. No, don't get up. It's good to be back in Sunnydale. Nice climate, plenty to eat, no tortured humanity to hold me down. But you know what bothers me? You don't seem to be getting the big picture here, Faith. Now I don't know why you turned me, but I'm just glad you did.
faith I've got my reasons.
angel Let me guess. You summoned back the true Angelus because you need a new boy toy. Doesn't work that way.
faith You wanna be smart? You listen to me.
angel Funny thing about vampires, Faith. We don't establish meaningful dialogue with Slayers.
faith Not how Buffy tells it.
angel I should have known you'd like it on top.
faith You want to listen or you want to die?
angel As long as you're there, I mostly want you to wriggle. But I'm listening.
faith Last time you got like this, Buffy kicked your ass all the way back to hell. You want to do better this time?
angel Still listening.
faith Good boy. Now all you got to do is play nice and call truce and I'll hook you up with the real power in this town. Interested?
angel Very.
faith Then get ready to meet the new boss.
wesley_wyndampryce Our enemy has us at a disadvantage. We seem to be consistently one step behind him. Now he has the Books of Ascenscion. We must take definitive action.
cordelia_chase You have the greatest voice. Have you ever thought about doing books on tape?
xander_harris Way to focus CC.
wesley_wyndampryce Yes, let's, uh, let's try to stay on track. We need everyone working together here. Where's Angel?
buffy_summers I don't know. I went to the mansion but he wasn't there.
wesley_wyndampryce And Faith?
buffy_summers She's missing too.
willow_rosenberg Which means nothing. Two unconnected events.
buffy_summers What should we do?
rupert_giles Buffy, I think you should try to retrieve the Books of Ascenscion. Check out the Mayor's office but be damned careful. Do not confront the Mayor. We don't know a thing about him.
buffy_summers I'll go home and stock up on weapons. Slip into something a little more break-and-enterish.
rupert_giles Right. Willow, how far did you get with the Mayor's files?
cordelia_chase Excuse me, I believe Wesley is running this meeting.
wesley_wyndampryce It's, uh, it's quite alright. Willow?
willow_rosenberg It's all bad news. By the time I got through the encryptions, the files were empty. Guess he saw me coming.
oz What about the Hall of Records? Go to the source.
wesley_wyndampryce Good idea. There must be information on the Mayor there.
rupert_giles Wesley, why don't you take the group and start looking?
wesley_wyndampryce Right.
cordelia_chase I'm in Wesley's group.
rupert_giles There is just the one group.
cordelia_chase Yes! And I am in it.
xander_harris Anyone mind if I skip the trip? I'm gonna cruise town, keep my ear to the ground, and I think five's a crowd.
cordelia_chase It really is.
oz I'll drive.
willow_rosenberg They liked your plan.
rupert_giles Anyone finds anything, check in with me. Be careful.
faith So, can I keep him?
mayor_richard_wilkins Let's just take things step by step for the moment. Now then, Angelus, may I call you Angel?
angel Well, actually, I'm thinking more along the lines of you calling me Master.
mayor_richard_wilkins Ah. You know, Angelus, attitude may get you attention, but courtesy wins respect. I am the one responsible for your new attitude.
angel That's why I'm here.
mayor_richard_wilkins No problems with the transition? No side effects?
angel Had a soul, now I'm free.
mayor_richard_wilkins That's terrific! Poetic too. Not that I read much poetry except for those little ones in the Reader's Digest. You know, some of those are quite catchy.
angel Hey, I don't mean to rush things here but are you trying to get to some kind of point?
mayor_richard_wilkins Kids today. Rush rush rush. Well the point, Angel, is you're a very powerful young man, good for Faith, and there just may be future for you in Sunnydale. I see you're admiring my letter opener.
angel Well, actually, I was thinking of stabbing you through the heart with it.
mayor_richard_wilkins Please do.
mayor_richard_wilkins Nice shot.
mayor_richard_wilkins You see, I'm what you might call impervious. Can't be killed, or harmed in any way. And that's just a cornerstone in my plans for this great town of ours.
angel Mmmm. Can't be killed, but you don't like germs?
mayor_richard_wilkins Uck, eew, awful things, unsanitary. But my question is, now that Faith has brought you back, what are your intentions?
angel Well, gee, sir, I thought I'd find that Slayer that's given you so much trouble and torture, maim, and kill her.
mayor_richard_wilkins Fine! You know it's nice to see you're not one of those slacker types running around town today. Torture Buffy. Killing her's fine, just make it a slow one.
angel My favorite kind.
mayor_richard_wilkins Wonderful, wonderful. We don't want a replacement Slayer anytime soon. They can't all turn out like my girl Faith. Have fun.
faith Let's do it.
mayor_richard_wilkins Uh, try to have her home by eleven.
mayor_richard_wilkins She's not a little girl anymore.
xander_harris I love when you talk, Wesley. I love when you sing, Wesley. Can you say the words jailbait, Wesley? Limey bastard. Hey guys! Man, where you been? You gotta find Buffy. She's going to her place and stocking up on ...
angel That guy just bugs me.
joyce_summers Faith. Angel.
angel Hi, Joyce, nice to see you. Is Buffy home?
joyce_summers Upstairs. Please tell me it's not some vampire thing.
angel The only vampire here is me, Joyce. Say, you change your hair?
joyce_summers Highlights.
angel Nice.
faith Knock knock.
buffy_summers Where have you guys been?
angel Been looking for you. Good thing we found you before we left.
faith We got the books.
angel They're at the mansion.
faith We'd take 'em to Giles ourselves, but I think strength in numbers is the way to go. Come on.
angel Let me get those for you.
buffy_summers Okay, let's get the books someplace safe. Where are they?
angel Actually, there's been a slight change in plan, Buff.
buffy_summers Buff? You just called ... What's the matter with you?
angel Nothing. Matter of act, I haven't felt this good in a long time.
buffy_summers Angel?
angel You know, I never properly thanked you for sending me to hell.
buffy_summers No.
angel Yeah, and I'm just wondering where do I start? Card? Fruit basket? Evisceration?
buffy_summers No.
angel Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Maybe there's still some good deep down inside of me that remembers and loves you. If only you could reach me. Then again, we have reality.
buffy_summers I will kill you before I let you touch me. Faith, we need to get out of here, now.
faith Speak for yourself, B. Me, I like it here.
angel One thing I learned about Buffy, she's so cute when she's sleeping.
cordelia_chase Hey! I know a way to make investigating the Mayor even more boring. On second thought, no, I don't.
oz Hey, whoa.
willow_rosenberg Whoa. Big hey whoa. Guys, check this out. Wow, like father, like son.
oz How about like exact same guy, like exact same guy?
wesley_wyndampryce Mayor Wilkins is over one hundred years old. He's not human.
xander_harris I, uh, hate to spoil the mood, but this is so much worse than you think.
willow_rosenberg Xander, what happened to you?
xander_harris You know how some people hate to say I told you so? Not me. I told you so. Angel's back in the really bad sense, and uh, I told you so.
wesley_wyndampryce Angelus has turned? Xander, this is terribly serious. Are you sure?
xander_harris Gee, let me think. Kind of hard to tell. Last thing I remember was his fist.
wesley_wyndampryce We must contact Giles immediately.
xander_harris Good thinking. Let's waste time with a lively debate. Leave Buffy alone. See how dead she gets.
cordelia_chase Slow down, Xander. This isn't Wesley's fault.
xander_harris Actually, it is. Faith was your responsibility. Guess who's Angel's new playmate?
willow_rosenberg Faith and Angel? Together?
xander_harris Imagine the possibilities.
angel Morning, sleepyhead. You know what I just can't believe? All of our time together and we never tried chains. Well, can't dwell on the past, especially with the future we have ahead.
faith Bondage looks good on you, B. The outfit's all wrong, but, hey!
buffy_summers You don't know what you're doing.
faith Really? Weird, because something about all this just feels so right. Maybe it's one of those unhappy childhood things. See, when I was a kid I used to beg my mom for a dog. Didn't matter what kind. I just wanted, you know, something to love. A dog's all I wanted. Well, that and toys. But mom was so busy, you know, enjoying the drinking and passing out parts of life, that I never really got what I wanted, until now.
buffy_summers Faith, listen to me very closely. Angel's a killer. When he's done with me, he'll turn on you.
angel She's right. I probably will.
faith Yeah? Hunh. Guess we'll just have to keep you around for a while then. Before we get started, I just want you to know, if you're a screamer, feel free.
buffy_summers Why, Faith? What's in it for you?
faith What isn't? You know, I come to Sunnydale. I'm the Slayer. I do my job kicking ass better than anyone. What do I hear about everywhere I go? Buffy. So I slay, I behave, I do the good little girl routine. And who's everybody thank? Buffy.
buffy_summers It's not my fault.
faith Everybody always asks, why can't you be more like Buffy? But did anyone ever ask if you could be more like me?
angel I know I didn't.
faith You get the Watcher. You get the mom. You get the little Scooby gang. What do I get? Jack squat. This is supposed to be my town!
buffy_summers Faith, listen to me!
faith Why? So you can impart some special Buffy wisdom, that it? Do you think you're better than me? Do you? Say it, you think you're better than me.
buffy_summers I am. Always have been.
faith Um, maybe you didn't notice. Angel's with me.
buffy_summers And how did you get him, Faith? Magic? Cast some sort of spell? Cause in the real world, Angel would never touch you and we both know it.
buffy_summers You had to tie me up to beat me. There's a word for people like you, Faith. Loser.
faith Uh huh. You're just trying to make me mad so I'll kill you. I'm too smart for that. Stick around.
buffy_summers For what? Your boss's lame Ascenscion. Like I couldn't stop it.
faith You can't.
buffy_summers I will.
faith Keep dreaming. No one can stop the Ascenscion. Mayor's got it wired, B. He built this town for demons to feed on and come graduation day, he's getting paid. And I'll be sitting at his right hand. Assuming he has hands after the transformation. I'm not too clear on that part. And all your little lame ass friends are going to be kibbles'n'bits. Think about that when your boyfriends cutting into you.
buffy_summers I never knew you had so much rage in you.
faith What can I say? I'm the world's best actor.
angel Second best.
buffy_summers Graduation day. You think we missed anything?
angel I think we know everything she knows.
buffy_summers May I say something? Psych!
faith You played me. You played me!
faith What are you gonna do, B, kill me? You become me. You're not ready for that, yet.
willow_rosenberg Are you okay?
Mage#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 The task is finished.
rupert_giles Yes. Thank you for coming to me and for that rather effective light show you put on.
Mage#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 This restores the balance between us, Rupert Giles. My debt to you is now repaid in full. Do not call upon me.
rupert_giles I shan't. Peace with you.
Mage#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode17 And with you.
willow_rosenberg His debt to you is repaid? What did you do?
rupert_giles I introduced him to his wife.
wesley_wyndampryce Well, I for one protest. You pitted Slayer against Slayer in a dangerous charade that could've gotten them both killed, without informing me! I'm telling the Council!
rupert_giles I think you should. We have a rogue Slayer on our hands. I can't think of anything more dangerous.
buffy_summers At least now we know.
rupert_giles And we know a little bit more about the Ascenscion.
willow_rosenberg Graduation day. There's a big scary un-fun. At least Angel's not bad, though. That's good, right?
xander_harris Yes, I feel so much better knowing that he broke my face in a good way. It's a good bruise.
buffy_summers He was only acting, Xander. It was just an act.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, you win some, you lose some. From where I'm sitting, it's batting average that counts. So you lost some friends.
faith I wouldn't exactly call them friends.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, what are you worried about? Chin up! You don't see me looking disappointed. Heck, no. You know why? Because I know you'll always have me, Faith. I'm the best, the most important friend you'll ever have. Besides, you know, once the Ascenscion starts, the 'in' crowd you're so concerned about? Whoo! They'll be lucky if there's enough left of them to fill a pothole. Promise. Still unhappy? Okey doke. I've got two words that are going to make all the pain go away. Miniature golf.
angel How you doing?
buffy_summers Been better.
angel Not hard to believe. You were a real soldier last night, Buffy.
buffy_summers That's me. One of the troops.
angel I know how hard it was for you.
buffy_summers I really doubt that.
angel Is there anything I can do to make it better?
buffy_summers Look, I know you only did what I asked. And we, we got what we wanted.
angel I never wanted it to go that far.
buffy_summers I know that. It's not even a question of that. It's just, after ... I need a little bit of a break. Please.
angel You still my girl?
buffy_summers Always.
