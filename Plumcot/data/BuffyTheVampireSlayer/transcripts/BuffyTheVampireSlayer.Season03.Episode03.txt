willow_rosenberg I'm giddy.
oz Oh, I like you giddy. Always have.
willow_rosenberg It's the freedom! As Seniors, we can go off-campus now for lunch. It's no longer cutting. It's legal! Heck, it's expected! Wow, it's, uh, also a big step forward, a Senior moment, one that has to be savored.
willow_rosenberg You can't just rush into this, you know?
willow_rosenberg Ohh!
willow_rosenberg No, I can't!
xander_harris You can.
oz See, you are.
willow_rosenberg Oh, but, no! What if they changed the rule without telling? What if they're lying in wait to *arrest* me a-and, and throw me in detention and mar my unblemished record?
xander_harris Breathe. Breathe.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Hmm...
willow_rosenberg This is good! This is... Hey, we're Seniors! Hey, I'm walkin' here!
xander_harris Ahh. Buffy and food.
willow_rosenberg Maybe we shouldn't be too couple-y around Buffy.
cordelia_chase Oh, you mean 'cause of how the only guy that ever liked her turned into a vicious killer and had to be put down like a dog?
xander_harris Can she cram complex issues into a nutshell, or what?
oz All right, prepare to uncouple...
oz Uncouple.
xander_harris Buffy, banned from campus, but not from our hearts, how are you and what's for lunch?
buffy_summers Oh, I just threw a few things together.
cordelia_chase When did you become Martha Stewart?
buffy_summers First of all, Martha Stewart knows jack about hand-cut prosciutto.
xander_harris I don't believe she slays, either.
oz Oh, I hear she can, but she doesn't like to.
buffy_summers Second of all, way too much free time on my hands since I got kicked out of school.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I know they'll let you back in.
xander_harris Don't you and your mom have a meeting with Principal Snyder?
buffy_summers We're seeing Snyde-Man tomorrow.
willow_rosenberg Ooo, Scott Hope at eleven o'clock. He likes you. He wanted to ask you out last year, but you weren't ready then. But I think you're ready now, or at least in the state of pre-readiness to make conversation, or-or to do that thing with your mouth that boys like.
willow_rosenberg Oh! I didn't mean the *bad* thing with your mouth, I meant that little half-smile thing that you... You're supposed to stop me when I do that.
oz I like when you do that.
scott_hope Hi, Buffy.
buffy_summers Hi.
willow_rosenberg I think that went very well. Don't you think that went very well?
cordelia_chase He didn't try to slit our throats or anything. That's progress.
willow_rosenberg Hey, did you do that little half-smile thing?
buffy_summers Look, I'm not trying to snare Scott Hope. I just want to get my life back, you know, do normal stuff.
willow_rosenberg Like date?
buffy_summers Well...
xander_harris Oh, you wanna date. I saw that half-smile, you little slut.
xander_harris Ow.
buffy_summers All right, yes, date and shop and hang out and go to school and save the world from unspeakable demons. You know, I wanna do girlie stuff!
himself_band_member Welcome to Happy Burger. May I take your order, please?
mr_trick Diet soda. Medium.
himself_band_member That'll be eighty-nine cents at the window, sir.
mr_trick Sunnydale. Town's got quaint. And the people? He called me 'sir'. Don't you just miss that? I mean, admittedly, it's not a haven for the brothers, you know, strictly the Caucasian Persuasion here in the Dale. But, you know, you just gotta stand up and salute their death rate. I ran a statistical analysis, and hello darkness. It makes... D.C. look... like Mayberry, and ain't nobody saying boo about it. We could fit right in here. Have us some fun.
kakistos We're here for one thing.
mr_trick Kill the Slayer, yeah. Still, big picture...
Boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode03 Have a nice night, sir.
mr_trick Right back at ya.
kakistos The Slayer. I'm going to rip her spine from her body, and I'm going to eat her heart and suck the marrow from her bones.
mr_trick Now I'm hungry.
buffy_summers I miss you.
buffy_summers I had to.
angel I loved you.
buffy_summers Oh, God! Angel...
angel GO TO HELL!
angel I did.
joyce_summers Morning, Sunshine! Ready to face the beast?
principal_snyder Here are the terms of your re-entry, Missy. Take 'em or leave 'em.
principal_snyder One: that you pass a makeup test of every class you skipped out on last year.
principal_snyder Two: that you provide, in writing, one *glowing* letter of recommendation from any member of our faculty who is not an English librarian.
principal_snyder Three: that you complete an interview with our school psychologist who must conclude that your violent tendencies...
principal_snyder ...are under control.
joyce_summers I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr. Snyder. I spoke with the school board, and according to them...
principal_snyder I'm required to educate every juvenile who is not in jail where she belongs.
principal_snyder Welcome back.
buffy_summers So let me get this straight. I'm really back in school because the school board *overruled* you. Wow. That's like having your whole ability to do this job called into question, when you think about it.
joyce_summers I think what my daughter's trying to say is... Nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah, nyah.
Secretary#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode03 It's the Mayor on line one.
willow_rosenberg It's so great that you're a schoolgirl again.
buffy_summers Giles say what he wanted? Do you think he's mad?
willow_rosenberg No, I don't think so. I think he just needed to see you. Have you ever noticed, though, when he *is* mad, but he's too English to say anything, he makes that weird cluck-cluck sound with his tongue?
buffy_summers Hi, Giles!
willow_rosenberg Oh, hi! Been there long?
rupert_giles Buffy, good timing. I could use your help. I trust you remember the demon Acathla?
buffy_summers Giles, contain yourself. Yes, I'm back in school, but you know how it embarrasses me when you gush so. Let's just skip all that and get straight to work.
rupert_giles Oh, ahhhh... Well, I, um... Well-w... O-o-of course, it's wonderful to have you back, i-i-it goes without saying. But... You enjoy making me say it, don't you?
buffy_summers Okay, Acathla, huh? What are you doing, making him some demon pizza?
rupert_giles We need to make sure that he remains dormant and that the dimensional vortex is sealed tight. So I'm working on a binding spell.
willow_rosenberg Oh, a spell? Can I help?
rupert_giles Possibly, with the research. It's very sensitive and...
willow_rosenberg Oh! Who's more sensitive than me?
rupert_giles ...and difficult spell. It involves creating a-a-a protective circle around... Well, I don't want to bore you with the details, but, uh, well, there's a litany th-that one has to recite in Aramaic, and it's very specific. So I need to get a few details about your experience of defeating Acathla and Angel.
buffy_summers Fire away.
rupert_giles I've put the time at about, um, 6:17, around, about half an hour after Xander rescued me.
buffy_summers Less. More like ten minutes.
rupert_giles Oh, was the vortex already open?
buffy_summers Barely.
rupert_giles I see. And Angel?
buffy_summers A big fight, Angel got the pointy end of the sword, Acathla sucked him into Hell instead of the world. That's about the it.
rupert_giles Yes, well, that, um... should be very helpful.
buffy_summers Oh, no, I have to go take an English makeup exam. They give you credit just for speaking it, right?
buffy_summers Oh...
willow_rosenberg Mm, sage. I love that smell. And marnox root. You know, a smidge of this mixed with a virgin's saliva... Does something I know nothing about.
rupert_giles These forces are not something that one plays around with, Willow. What have you been conjuring?
willow_rosenberg Nothing... much. Well, you know, I tried this spell to cure Angel, and I guess that was a bust. But since then, you know, small stuff: floating feather, fire out of ice, which next time I won't do on the bedspread. Are you mad at me?
rupert_giles No, of course not, no. If I were, I would be making a strange clucking sound with my tongue.
buffy_summers Don't let me interrupt.
oz Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Are you... Is she all glowy?
oz Yeah, I suspect happiness.
buffy_summers I passed my English makeup exam, hangin' with my friends. Hello, my life, how I've missed you.
willow_rosenberg Hi, Scott. What are you doing here?
scott_hope You told me if I came after 8:00, I could run into Buffy.
scott_hope Uh, I'm sorry. I'm a bad liar. It's not good for the soul. O-o-or the skin, actually. It makes me blotch.
buffy_summers Hi, Scott.
scott_hope Hi.
scott_hope Don't you love this song?
buffy_summers Uh, yeah! Actually, I do.
scott_hope Well, would you like to...
buffy_summers Dance? Um...
buffy_summers I don't know. I'm bad with... Well...
buffy_summers Thank you for asking, it's just that there...
scott_hope Okay, you know what? I'm just gonna go stand by the dance floor. If you change your mind, you can mosey on over, and then if not, then you don't mosey. No harm, no foul, right?
buffy_summers Right.
willow_rosenberg Come on, Buffy. I mean, the guy is charm, a-and normal, which is what you wanted to get back to.
oz Plus bonus points for use of the word 'mosey'.
buffy_summers I just don't think I'm ready.
willow_rosenberg What's stopping you?
cordelia_chase Check out Slut-O-Rama and her Disco Dave.
cordelia_chase What was the last thing that guy danced to, K.C. and the Sunshine Band?
buffy_summers I don't think that guy thrives on sunshine.
scott_hope Hi.
buffy_summers Hi. Oh, no, I... I-I have to...
scott_hope Oh. Uh, uh, sorry, my bad.
buffy_summers No. I-it's mine. Really, it's mine, but I... I-I-I have to go.
buffy_summers Where'd she go?
cordelia_chase I bet it's nothing. They're probably just making out.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode03 Hey!
willow_rosenberg That's not what making out sounds like, unless I'm doing it wrong.
Boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode03 Stop struggling. This won't hurt.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode03 It's okay, I got it. You're, uh, Buffy, right?
faith I'm Faith.
oz I'm gonna go out on a limb and say there's a new Slayer in town.
faith Can I borrow that?
faith Thanks, B. Couldn't have done it without you.
faith The whole summer it was, like, the worst heat wave. So it's about a hundred and eighteen degrees and I'm sleeping without a stitch on.
faith And all of a sudden, I hear this screaming from outside. So I go tearing out, stark nude, and this church bus has broke down, and there's these three vamps feasting on half the Baptists in South Boston. So I waste the vamps, and the preacher comes up, and he's hugging me like there's no tomorrow, when all of a sudden, the cops pull up and they arrested us both.
xander_harris Wow. They should film that story and show it every Christmas.
faith God, I could eat a horse. Isn't it crazy how slayin' just always makes you hungry and horny?
buffy_summers Well... Sometimes I-I crave a nonfat yogurt afterwards.
cordelia_chase I get it.
cordelia_chase Not the horny thing. Yuck! But the two Slayer thing. There was one, and then Buffy died for, like, two minutes, so then Kendra was called, and then when she died, Faith was called.
willow_rosenberg But why were you called here?
faith Well, I wasn't. My Watcher went off to some retreat thing in England, and so I skipped out. I figured this was my chance to meet the infamous Buff and compare notes. So, B, did you really use a rocket launcher one time?
buffy_summers Uh, yeah, actually, it's a funny story. There was...
xander_harris So what was the, uh, story about that alligator? You, uh, said something... before.
faith Oh, there's this Big Daddy Vampire out of Missouri who used to keep them as pets. So he's got me rasslin' one of 'em, okay? The thing must have been twelve feet long and I'm...
xander_harris So was this, um, ahem, also naked?
faith Well, the alligator was.
cordelia_chase Xander? Find a new theme.
faith I tell ya, I never had more trouble than that damn vamp. So what about you? What was your toughest kill?
buffy_summers Um, well, you know, they're all difficult, I guess.
buffy_summers Uh... Oh! Oh, do you guys remember the Three?
buffy_summers That's right, you never met the Three. Well, there was three...
oz Something occurring. Uh, now, you both kill vamps, and who could blame you, but, I'm, I'm wondering about your position on werewolves.
willow_rosenberg Oz is a werewolf.
buffy_summers It's a long story.
oz I got bit.
buffy_summers Apparently not that long.
faith Hey, as long as you don't go scratchin' at me or humpin' my leg, we're five-by-five, you know?
oz Fair enough.
faith The vamps, though, they better get their asses to DEFCON ONE, 'cause you and I are gonna have fun, you know, Watcherless and fancy-free.
buffy_summers Watcherless?
faith Didn't yours go to England, too?
rupert_giles There's a Watchers' retreat every year in the Cotswolds. It's a lovely spot. It's very s-serene. There's horse riding and hiking and punting and lectures and discussions. It-i-it's... it's a great honor to be invited. Or so I'm told.
faith Oh, it's boring. Way too stuffy for a guy like you.
buffy_summers Um, maybe I should introduce you again. Faith, this is *Giles*.
faith I see him. If I'd've known they came *that* young and cute, I would've requested a transfer.
buffy_summers Raise your hand if 'ew'.
rupert_giles Well, um, uh, leaving aside for a moment my, uh, youth and beauty, I'd-I'd say it was, um, fortuitous that Faith arrived when she did.
willow_rosenberg Aha!
willow_rosenberg Sorry. I just meant... aha! There's big evil brewin'. You'll never be bored here, Faith. 'Cause this is Sunnydale, home of the big brewin' evil.
rupert_giles Yes, well, I don't know how big an evil it is, but, uh, two people have disappeared from the Sunset Ridge District.
buffy_summers Well, I'm good for patrolling. Late-ish, though. I promised Mom I'd be home for dinner.
buffy_summers Um, to which you're also invited, of course, dinner with us.
faith Dyin' to meet the fam. I'm in.
buffy_summers Great! Great, then we can patrol, also together.
willow_rosenberg Hey, don't you have that health science makeup?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah. Actually, I could use a little coaching.
willow_rosenberg You know, you can hang out with us while she's testing. You wanna?
xander_harris Say yes and, uh, bring your stories.
buffy_summers You guys go. It's fine. Fine! I'll just... sit.
faith Okay. Hey, later. *We* will talk weapons.
rupert_giles This, um, this new girl seems to have a lot of zest.
rupert_giles I-I-I've been having a little problem with the, uh, binding spell for Acathla. I-I-I'm lacking the, the requisite details to perform it correctly. Now, physical location. Acathla was facing south?
buffy_summers Mm-hm. Acathla, Angel, me. Sword.
rupert_giles Now, see, that's what I thought, but I...
buffy_summers Giles, look, I've got makeup tests to pass, missing people in Sunset Ridge, and a zesty new Slayer to feed. Next time I kill Angel, I'll video it.
willow_rosenberg And over here, we have the cafeteria, where we were mauled by snakes.
xander_harris And this is the spot where Angel tried to kill Willow.
willow_rosenberg Oh, and over there in the lounge is where Spike and his gang nearly massacred us all on Parent-Teacher night.
willow_rosenberg Oh, a-and up those stairs, I was sucked into a muddy grave.
xander_harris And they say young people don't learn anything in high school nowadays, but, um, I've learned to be afraid.
faith You guys are a hoot and a half. If I'd had friends like you in high school, I... probably still would've dropped out. But I might've been sad about it, you know?
faith Hey, so what's up with B? I mean, she seems wound kinda tight. Needs to find the fun a little? Like you two.
willow_rosenberg Well, um, she...
faith Oh. Water.
xander_harris Oh, and then the alligator story! She's got something, doesn't she?
cordelia_chase What is it with you and Slayers? Maybe I should dress up as one and put a stake to your throat.
xander_harris Please, God, don't let that be sarcasm.
scott_hope Oh. Excuse me.
faith Sorry. I know you from somewhere.
scott_hope The Bronze. You're friends with Buffy, right?
faith Yeah. I'm Faith.
scott_hope I'm Scott. Nice to meet you.
faith Nice to meet you!
buffy_summers Well, I'm two for two with makeup tests. Proud, yes, but also humble in this time of... We're looking at what?
cordelia_chase Does anyone believe that is her actual hair color?
willow_rosenberg I haven't seen him laugh like that. Hey, maybe Faith and Scott could hit it off. I mean, if you're done with him. Not that you used him.
buffy_summers Well, I... hadn't definitely one hundred percent said no for all time. It's just, you know... You don't enter into these things lightly, you know. There's, there's repercussions to consider and...
buffy_summers Why am I seeing a look?
willow_rosenberg You really *do* need to find the fun, B.
willow_rosenberg Uffy.
buffy_summers Hey!
scott_hope Hey, Buffy! Uh, Faith has been telling me tall tales.
buffy_summers She's funny. And she's leaving. We have to go.
scott_hope Oh...
faith Bye.
faith He's a cutie. Is he seeing anybody?
kakistos Mr. Trick, talk to me.
mr_trick Check this out. This town, this very street, wired for fiber optics. See, we jack in a T-3, um, twenty-five hundred megs per, we have the whole *world* at our fingertips.
mr_trick What I'm saying is, we stay localwhere the humans are jumpin' and the cotton is highbut we live global. I mean, you know, you get the hankering for the blood of a fifteen-year-old Filipina, and I'm on the 'Net and she's here the next day, express air.
kakistos I want the blood of the Slayer.
mr_trick On that note, there's good news and bad. Rumor has it that this town already has a Slayer, which makes two. I'm not real sure how that happened.
kakistos I don't care if there're a *hundred* Slayers! I'll kill them all! She's going to pay for what she did to me.
mr_trick Yeah, she is. I'm running a computer check on every hotel, rooming house and youth hostel in town. Meanwhile, as soon as the sun goes down, we're out in force. Food's here, boys.
pizza_guy You guys order a piz...
joyce_summers So you're a Slayer, too. Isn't that interesting! Do you like it?
faith God, I love it!
buffy_summers Uh, Mom?
joyce_summers Uh, just a second, honey. You know, Buffy never talks that way. Why do you love it?
faith Well, when I'm fighting, it's like the whole world goes away and I only know one thing: that I'm gonna win and they're gonna lose. I like that feelin'.
buffy_summers Well, sure. Beats that dead feeling you get when they win and you lose.
faith I don't let that kind of negative thinking in.
joyce_summers Right. Right. That could get you hurt. Buffy can be awfully negative sometimes. See, honey, you gotta fight that.
buffy_summers I'm working on it.
joyce_summers Oh, Faith, can I get you another soft drink?
faith Oh, you bet.
joyce_summers Right.
faith She's really cool, huh?
buffy_summers Best mom ever. Excuse me.
joyce_summers I like this girl, Buffy.
buffy_summers She's very personable. She gets along with my friends, my Watcher, my mom. Look, now she's getting along with my fries.
joyce_summers Now, Buffy...
buffy_summers Plus, at school today, she was making eyes at my not-boyfriend. This is creepy.
joyce_summers Does anybody else think Faith is creepy?
buffy_summers No, but I'm the one getting single-white-femaled here.
joyce_summers It's probably good you were an only child.
buffy_summers Mom, I'm just getting my life back. I'm not looking to go halfsies on it.
joyce_summers Well, there are some things I'd be happy to see you share. Like the slaying. I mean, two of you fighting is safer than one, right?
buffy_summers I guess.
joyce_summers Unless, I mean, you heard her. She *loves* the slaying. Couldn't she take over for you?
buffy_summers Mom, no one can take over for me.
joyce_summers But you're going to college next year. I think it would be...
buffy_summers Mom, the only way you get a new Slayer is when the old Slayer dies.
joyce_summers Then that means you... When did you die? You never told me you died!
buffy_summers No, i-it was just for a few minutes.
joyce_summers Oh, I hate this. I hate your life.
buffy_summers Mom, I...
joyce_summers Look, I-I know you didn't choose this, I know it chose you. I have tried to march in the 'Slayer Pride' parade, but... I don't want you to die.
joyce_summers Oh...
buffy_summers I'm not gonna die. I know how to do my job. Besides, like you said, I've got help now.
buffy_summers I've got all the help I can stand.
faith Didn't we, um, do this street already?
buffy_summers Funny thing about vamps. They'll hit a street even *after* you've been there. It's like they have no manners.
faith Mm. You've been doing this the longest.
buffy_summers I have.
faith Yeah. Maybe a little *too* long.
buffy_summers Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?
faith Nothing.
buffy_summers You got a problem?
faith I'm five-by-five, B, living entirely large, actually wondering about *your* problem.
buffy_summers Well, I may not sleep in the nude and rassle alligators...
faith Maybe it's time you started, 'cause obviously *something* in your bottle needs uncorking. What is it, the, the Angel thing?
buffy_summers What do you know about Angel?
faith Just what your friends tell me: big love, big loss. You oughta deal and move on, but you're not.
buffy_summers I got an idea: how about from now on, we don't hear from you on Angel or anything else in my life. Which, by the way, is *my* life.
faith What are you getting so strung out for, B?
buffy_summers Why are your lips still moving, F?
faith Did I just hear a threat?
buffy_summers Would you like to?
faith Wow. Think you can take me?
buffy_summers Yeah. I just hope they can't.
faith My dead mother hits harder than that!
buffy_summers Faith! Stake him already and give me a hand!
faith This is *me*, you un dead bastard!
vampire For Kakistos we live! For Kakistos you'll die!
buffy_summers FAITH!
buffy_summers OH!
buffy_summers Faith!
faith You can't touch me!
buffy_summers What is wrong with you?
faith What are you talking about?
buffy_summers I'm talking about you 'living large' on that vampire!
faith Gee, if doing violence to vampires upsets you, I think you're in the wrong line of work!
buffy_summers Yeah, or maybe you like it a little too much.
faith I was getting the job done.
buffy_summers The job is to slay demons! *Not* beat them to a bloody pulp while their friends corner me!
faith I thought you could handle yourself.
rupert_giles What you must realize, Buffy, is that you and Faith have very different temperaments.
buffy_summers Yeah, and mine's the sane one. The girl's not playing with a full deck, Giles. She has almost no deck. She has a three.
rupert_giles You said yourself that she-she killed one. Sh-she-she's just a plucky fighter who got a little carried away. Which is natural. She's focused on the slaying. She doesn't have a whole other life here, as you do.
buffy_summers She doesn't need a life. She has mine.
rupert_giles I think you're being a little...
buffy_summers No, I'm being a lot. I know that. But she nearly got us both killed. The girl needs help.
rupert_giles All right. I'll see if I can reach her Watcher at the retreat. They're eight hours ahead now. I guess they're probably sitting down to a nightcap.
rupert_giles I wonder if they still kayak. I used to love a good kayak. You see, t-they don't even consider... Sorry. I digress. The, um, vampires that attacked you, can you furnish me with some details that might help me trace their lineage? I mean, ancient or-or-or modern dress. Amulets, cultish tattoos...
buffy_summers Uh, no tats. Crappy dressers. And, uh... Oh, the one that nearly bit me mentioned something about kissing toast. He lived for kissing toast.
rupert_giles You mean 'Kakistos'?
buffy_summers Maybe it was taquitos. Maybe he lived for taquitos. What?
rupert_giles Kakistos.
buffy_summers Is that bad?
rupert_giles 'Kakistos' is Greek. It means the worst of the worst. It's also the name of a vampire so old that his hands and feet are cloven.
buffy_summers Now, this guy shows up two days ago, right? Right around the same time my bestest new little sister makes the scene.
rupert_giles You think he and Faith are connected?
buffy_summers Giles, there are two things that I don't believe in: coincidence and leprechauns.
rupert_giles Well, Buffy, it's entirely possible that they both arrived here by chance simultaneously.
buffy_summers Okay, but I was right about the leprechauns, right?
rupert_giles As far as I know, yes.
buffy_summers Good. Okay, you get England on the phone. I'm gonna talk to Faith, see if 'khaki trousers' rings...
rupert_giles Kakistos.
buffy_summers Kakistos rings a bell. Or an alarm.
rupert_giles Right.
buffy_summers Right.
scott_hope Hi.
buffy_summers Scott!
scott_hope How are you?
buffy_summers Uh, o-okay. You know, I-I gotta...
scott_hope I know, be somewhere else, right? Think of this as my last-ditch effort. I realize that one more is gonna qualify as stalking. I've given it a lot of thoughtsome might say too much thoughtto, to how I might be a part of your life. It begins with conversation. We all know this. Maybe over a cup of coffee, or maybe at the Buster Keaton festival playing on State Street all this weekend.
buffy_summers You know, come to think of it, I-I don't think I've given a fair chance to... Buster Keaton. I... I like what I've seen of him so far. I... I think it might be time to see a little more.
scott_hope Keaton is key. Oh. Um, I got you a little present. The guy in the retro shop said that it represents friendship, and that's something I would very much like to have with you.
scott_hope You like?
buffy_summers I can't. I-I-I-I can't do this.
scott_hope Okay. I get the message.
rupert_giles Are you all right?
buffy_summers Uh... Giles, I, uh... Yeah, I'm fine. Um, did you reach the retreat?
rupert_giles Yes, I did.
buffy_summers W-what did her Watcher say?
rupert_giles Her Watcher's dead.
manager The room's eighteen dollars a day. That's every day.
faith Yeah, I know. I'll get it to you by tomorrow, I swear.
manager It's not like I own the place.
faith But I bet you will someday.
manager Not if I listen to broads like you.
manager Roommates are extra.
buffy_summers I'm just visiting.
faith So, what brings you to the poor side of town?
buffy_summers Cloven Guy. Goes by the name Kakistos.
faith What do you know about Kakistos?
buffy_summers That he's here.
buffy_summers We're not happy to see old friends, are we? What'd he do to you?
faith It's what I did to him, all right?
buffy_summers And what was that? Faith, you came here for a reason. I can help.
faith You can mind your own business. *I'm* the one that can handle this.
buffy_summers Yeah. You're a real bad-ass when it comes to packing. What was that you said about my problem? Gotta deal and move on? Well, we have the 'moving on' part right here. What about dealing? Is that just something you're gonna dump on me?
faith You don't know me. You don't know what I've been through. I'll take care of this, all right?
buffy_summers Like you took care of your Watcher?
buffy_summers He killed her, didn't he?
faith They don't have a word for what he did to her.
faith Oh, what now?
buffy_summers Faith, you run, he runs after you.
faith That's where the head start comes in handy.
kakistos Faith.
faith No!
buffy_summers I just bought us a little more...
buffy_summers ...time!
faith NO! NOOOOO!
buffy_summers Scream later! Escape now!
buffy_summers Let's go!
buffy_summers We're okay. What happened?
buffy_summers Faith, what happened?
faith I... I was *there* when he killed my Watcher, and I saw what he did to her... what he was gonna do to me. I tried to stop him, but I... I couldn't. And I ran.
buffy_summers Faith, first rule of slaying: don't die. You did the right thing. Okay? You didn't die. Now you do the math. One of him, two of us.
faith No.
buffy_summers Yes.
faith No.
faith This is his place.
buffy_summers He drove us here.
buffy_summers Faith! Don't die!
faith NO!
mr_trick If we don't do something, the Master could get killed.
mr_trick Well, our prayers are with him.
mr_trick There's a reason these vengeance crusades are out of style. It's the modern vampire who sees the big picture.
kakistos I guess you need a bigger stake, Slayer!
buffy_summers You hungry?
faith Starved.
rupert_giles The council has approved our request. Faith is to stay here indefinitely. I'm to look after you both until a new Watcher is assigned.
buffy_summers Good. She really came through in the end. She had a lot to deal with, but she did it. She got it behind her.
rupert_giles I'm glad to hear it.
buffy_summers Angel was cured.
rupert_giles I'm sorry?
buffy_summers When I killed him, Angel was cured. Your spell worked at the last minute, Will. I was about to take him out, and, um... something went through him... and he was Angel again. He-he didn't remember anything that he'd done. He just held me. Um, but i-it was... it was too late, and I, I had to. So I, I told him that I loved him... and I kissed him... and I killed him.
buffy_summers I don't know if that helps with your spell or not, Giles.
rupert_giles Uh, yes, I, I believe it will.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry.
buffy_summers It's okay. I've been holding on to that for so long. Felt good to get it out. I'll see you guys later.
willow_rosenberg Giles, I know you don't like me playing with mystical forces, but I can really help with this binding spell.
rupert_giles There is no spell.
buffy_summers Scott.
scott_hope Uh, hello.
buffy_summers Hey. Uh, I was, um, I was waiting for you to get out of class.
scott_hope Oh. Um, why?
buffy_summers Um... There was someone a while ago, and, uh, the ring sort of confused me. But I liked what you said about friendship. I liked it a lot. And Buster Keaton. Big fun. And I'm capable of big fun even though there's no earthly way you could possibly know that about me. Wow. If I knew I was gonna go on this long, I probably would've brought some water. Uh, what I'm trying to say is, um... if you would still like to go to the film festivaland I would understand it if you didn'tI'd pretty much love to go with you.
scott_hope Uh... Ahem. I don't know, Buffy. I'm, I'm really gonna have to think about this.
scott_hope Okay. You know what, I thought about it, and I'm in. When do you want to go?
buffy_summers Uh, well, I have one thing that I have to do tonight, and then I'm good.
scott_hope Good.
buffy_summers Goodbye.
