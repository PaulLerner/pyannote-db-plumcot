xander_harris Now I get Warren being the supervillainy type, but I thought Jonathan completely learned that lesson. I never even heard of this other guy.
willow_rosenberg You should have seen their headquarters. It was like the nerd natural habitat.
anya Well, if we know where they are, shouldn't we do something?
willow_rosenberg We tried. Buffy was gonna go in there and bust them on the spot.
xander_harris I'm sensing a 'not so completely.'
willow_rosenberg Yeah, well, she went in, and then-
anya Speaking of Buffy, isn't she ready? She's gonna be late for her first day.
willow_rosenberg Hey, respect the narrative flow much?
anya Please continue the story of failure.
willow_rosenberg So, Buffy went in, but they'd cleared out. And she brought back the stuff that they left... ... spell books, some parchments, a couple of rare things, charmed objects, and a conjurer's harp...
willow_rosenberg A-and they had other stuff, you know, Razor scooters, and pictures of the Vulcan woman on Enterprise.
xander_harris Ooh! I mean ... nerds.
anya Okay. See, this is why demons are better than people.
willow_rosenberg Interesting turn.
anya When I was a vengeance demon, I caused pain and mayhem, certainly. But I put in a full day's work doing it, and I got compensated appropriately.
xander_harris Welcome to today's episode of 'Go Money Go!' I hear it daily.
willow_rosenberg Yep, for the rest of your life.
anya But supervillains ... want reward without labor, to make things come easy. It's wrong. Without labor there can be no payment, and vice versa. The country cannot progress. The workers are the tools that shape America.
buffy_summers Good to know.
buffy_summers I was kinda feelin' like a tool.
buffy_summers And now I know why.
training_video_narrator You've seen us in your city or small town across the American West...
training_video_narrator ...you've ordered our delicious food...
training_video_narrator ...from our happy employees!
training_video_narrator But now you're seeing it all from a different way, you're seeing it from behind the counter!
training_video_narrator ...because you've just become part of the DoubleMeat experience!
BOY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 I'm part of it!
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 I'm part of it!
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 I'm a part of it too!
training_video_narrator This cow... and this chicken... ...don't know it yet, but they're destined to become part of it as well! So what happens when a cow and a chicken come together?
training_video_narrator Why, that's a DoubleMeat Medley! Let's take a look now at the process of harvesting these two special meats.
buffy_summers Holy crap!
training_video_narrator ...washing your hands thoroughly after each visit to the restroom.
training_video_narrator Follow these rules and you'll be a happy part of the DoubleMeat family for a long time!
manny Interesting, isn't it?
buffy_summers Oh yes! Like how the cow and the chicken come together even though they've never met. It's like
manny I'm Manny the manager. It's not a joke, it's just my name.
buffy_summers Right. Y-you mentioned that a couple of times when I filled out the application.
manny Why do you want to work here, Buffy? You seem like a sharp young woman, and there are a lot of other jobs.
buffy_summers Well, I-I kinda need money pretty quickly, like, today, and, and so I didn't want to go through a lengthy interview process, and I figured this was probably the fastest... way... to...
buffy_summers Be...cause I ... wanted to be part of the DoubleMeat experience?
manny Come on, let's take a tour.
manny Philip, Timothy, this is Buffy. She's going to work the counter.
buffy_summers Hi.
phillip What happened to the other one? Catherine?
manny Emily?
phillip Yeah.
timothy She's gone.
buffy_summers What happened?
timothy Whatever always happens.
manny You can use this one.
buffy_summers Uh ... there's, there's someone's stuff in there.
manny They must have left it. You can toss it, or keep what you want.
buffy_summers Sure they're not coming back?
manny We have a lot of turnover here.
manny Watch these two.
buffy_summers Are they gonna do something?
manny They're solid. Follow their example and you won't go wrong.
manny They're lifers.
buffy_summers Lifers?
manny In it for life. Like me. You wanna get something out of this, Buffy? You'll do the same. You put the work in, and ten years from now, you'll be where I am.
manny I promise you.
manny Congratulations. You're on the clock.
manny This is the kitchen. The beating heart of the DoubleMeat Palace.
buffy_summers Wow. They're all so ... identical.
manny Yeah. They all start to look the same to me too.
buffy_summers Oh, no, not the employees, the, the chicken slices.
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Uh yeah, Medley meal number 2, uh, double-size it...
manny Drive-through station's over there. High pressure job, you won't need to go in there. Over there's the grills, the fryers, the walk-in freezer...
manny You don't need to go in there either!
manny That's the dehydrated pickle storage. Those are locked!
manny Now I want to show you this.
manny Look. The DoubleMeat Medley.
buffy_summers Oh, I know the Medley! It's just, uh, the video was ... kind of graphic, with the slaughter.
manny The classic double-decker with a twist. A pure beefy patty above the mid-bun ... and a slice of processed chicken product below the mid-bun. Plus pickles, and the secret ingredient. Eat it.
buffy_summers Oh, you know, I had a-a big breakfast. I'll just wait for...
buffy_summers Uh ... but it smells so good.
buffy_summers Mm. So, what *is* your secret ingredient?
manny It's a meat process.
manny Now I think it's time to start earning your money, don't you, Buffy?
buffy_summers Mm-hmm.
buffy_summers So ... what's the deal with Manny the manager? If I ask him really nice can I write a children's book called that?
gary Fill this while I get the fries.
buffy_summers Fill this? I didn't know there was gonna be drug testing on this job.
gary You're funny. You better stop that.
buffy_summers Why?
gary Productivity. One of Manny's watch-words. 'Levity is the time-thief that picks the pocket of the company.'
buffy_summers I prefer the one that goes, 'Manny's a humorless dolt who picks the pocket of he-should-bite-me.'
gary You really need to be quiet with that.
gary Here you go.
CUSTOMER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Thanks.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 I'd like a small coffee, and cherry pie.
gary That's a dollar ninety-two, ma'am.
buffy_summers You hit so many buttons, it's like, button-palooza.
gary No, it's easy, I - look.
gary There are little pictures of the food on the buttons. I hit the coffee button, then I hit the small button. And then cherry pie. There's a picture of a little fried pie.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
gary Then, I hit the total button... I put the money in the drawer, I close it, and it resets the system. A cocker spaniel could do it. Here, why don't you take the next one, the family? They're regulars.
buffy_summers Hi. I'm new.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 I come here every day.
buffy_summers That's nice.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Oh, you really might make it, dear. Not like some of them, where suddenly you never see them again. I can see you here a long time.
buffy_summers That's great.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Thank you.
buffy_summers Hi. Welcome to the DoubleMeat Palace, may I help you?
FATHER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Yeah. We need two Number Four Medley Meals, a junior Medley, a Fisherman's Medley with bacon, and a kid's meal. Plus three fries, a chocolatey shake, and extra pickles on one of the Medleys.
buffy_summers Excuse me. Um, this button. Does it look chocolatey to you?
manny You don't need to be in there.
buffy_summers Sorry. I was just curious.
manny Curiosity killed the cat.
buffy_summers Theory number five. Cat burgers.
dawn_summers Hey Buffy!
anya We're here to support your subsistence-level employment. Bravo.
buffy_summers Thank you. This is cool of you guys.
xander_harris So, Buff, how's it going?
buffy_summers I don't know. I-I've waitressed before, but ... this is different.
dawn_summers Uh, when have you waitressed?
buffy_summers That summer in L.A. It was a diner, and ... we had, you know, lots of people who didn't tip, and funny funny health code violations ... but ... it, it wasn't like it is here. I think there's something wrong, here. W-Will, are you okay?
willow_rosenberg Uh, sorry, I, uh... Yeah, uh ... something's wrong?
buffy_summers There's, there's this manager, right, and he's all scary and mysterious, you know? And then there's the secret ingredient. And, and the people that work here? They're, they're kind of strange, you know? They just ... just stare into space ... plus they disappear.
anya Disappear poof?
buffy_summers No, not poof. Well, I don't think so.
xander_harris It's fast food. I have swum these murky waters, my friend. There's the assorted creepiness, there's staring, there's the enthusiastic not showing up at all. I think you're seeing demons where there's just life.
buffy_summers I, I didn't say demons. It's just a vibe. I mean, you guys still haven't seen this manager.
anya Well, isn't that him over there, getting the pickles wet?
xander_harris Yeah, with the saddle shoes...
willow_rosenberg ...and the glasses?
buffy_summers I don't know. Maybe it's just the video that's freakin' me out. With the cow, and the chicken, all swirly together.
xander_harris Mm, make me hungry, why don't you? How's about one of those delicious Medley Meals?
buffy_summers Okay, you got it. On me.
xander_harris Hey, thanks! See, I think she'll be fine once she settles into the routine. And by ordering, I'm helping.
dawn_summers And getting a free meal?
xander_harris Well, yeah.
anya Well, if you like the food here, honey, maybe we should get it for the reception.
dawn_summers You're serving burgers? Cool!
anya Well, time is running very short. After Willow gave us the 'whoosh' engagement party, I got slack on the planning 'cause I figured she'd help, but, well, now that's all been blown to hell.
willow_rosenberg Hey, standing right here! Standing right exactly here.
anya Sorry. Didn't mean to tempt you.
anya Everyone's so delicate. Anyway, I still have to select the bridesmaids' dresses, and, well, then there are the guests from out of town and the ones from the demon realm you wouldn't believe how many of them have yet to let us know either way.
buffy_summers There you go, and I double-sized it for ya.
xander_harris Oh, thank you!
buffy_summers And cut way back on the cat.
xander_harris Cat?!
buffy_summers Just kidding. Probably.
buffy_summers Sloooow night.
buffy_summers Gina.
buffy_summers Since it's slow, do you think they'll mind if I take another break?
gina We're not allowed. Downtime robs us all.
buffy_summers Mm, thus quoth Manny. There's no one here.
gina Sure there is. Look.
buffy_summers This'll make my day complete. What?
spike What's in the DoubleMeat nuggets?
buffy_summers I'm working. Go away.
spike Yeah, and you chose to be in the consumer service profession, and I'm a consumer. Service me.
buffy_summers Order something or go.
spike Give a bloke a chance for his eyes to adjust. Damn fluorescent lights. Makes me look dead.
spike Some demons love 'em. The way they vibrate makes the skin twitch. That the kinda demon you are, luv?
buffy_summers I am not a demon. I don't know why you can hit me, but I am not a demon.
spike Oh. I see. That why you took this job? Prove something to yourself? A normal job for a normal girl? Good way to drive yourself crazy, that is.
buffy_summers I'll be fine.
spike Buffy.
spike You're not happy here.
buffy_summers Please don't make this harder.
spike You don't belong here. You're something ... you're better than this.
buffy_summers I need the money.
spike I can get money. Walk with me now, come on.
buffy_summers I ... I need to go help Gary with the fries.
spike You gotta get outta here, this place'll do stuff to you.
spike This place'll kill you!
gary Someone there?
gary Oh, hi, what are you doing? What, what-
buffy_summers Feels like I just left, you know?
timothy You came back.
buffy_summers I came back.
manny Gary's gone.
buffy_summers Gary. Oh, the guy that helped me out at the counter yesterday?
manny He didn't show up this morning.
buffy_summers Well, shift's just starting.
manny He was supposed to unlock early this morning. Didn't show. Pull his card.
buffy_summers Well, I'm, I'm sure, you know, he's just late. He didn't seem like he was leaving.
manny I'm moving Timothy to counter. You're on grill.
buffy_summers Me?
manny I've been watching you.
buffy_summers B-but I-I don't know how to grill.
manny Just think. This is the last day you'll ever be able to say that.
phillip You put the beef on the grill, you hit the button, then it beeps. You flip the beef, hit the other button, then it beeps. You put it on the bun... There's not a button for that.
buffy_summers Repeat until insane.
phillip It eliminates variation. Every burger at every DoubleMeat Palace is the same. People don't like variation.
buffy_summers Got it. Variety is the spice of bad.
phillip Mm.
buffy_summers So ... what's the secret ingredient?
phillip It's a meat process.
buffy_summers Well, what does that mean?
phillip It's a process, they do it to the meat.
buffy_summers But, what *is* it?
phillip It's just the name of the process.
buffy_summers Oh. Yeah.
buffy_summers So, I ... guess we're gonna get ... kinda greasy, huh?
phillip Mm.
phillip Skin ... hair ... eyelashes ... nostrils...
phillip ...inside your ears... You wanna look inside my ears?
buffy_summers No. No, that's okay.
phillip Once I noticed I couldn't hear and went to the doctor. He said it was grease ... that made a plug.
buffy_summers Ohh.
phillip Mm. They gave me a kit. Kit for cleaning my ears. It's got this little bulb mechanism.
buffy_summers Imagine that.
manny Buffy?
buffy_summers Yay! It's Manny!
manny You're working a double shift.
buffy_summers What? A...nother eight hours? Right after these eight hours? But that's ... so many hours.
manny You get paid for it. Plus an extra free DoubleMeat Medley.
buffy_summers What happened? Why the double shiftiness?
manny Gary didn't show. And now one of my grinder guys is late too.
buffy_summers But they could still show up, right? I mean, they could be anywhere.
timothy Your meat's here.
xander_harris Yeah, okay, bye. Ahn, that was Buffy, she's working late, so I might have to go- yah!
halfrek I have been called, and vengeance shall I wreak. Cower, masculine one ... tremble as you face my wrath!
anya Xander, I'm starting to think that maybe we should do a pot-luck thing.
xander_harris Honey?
halfrek Hello. I am here to tear this man apart. How many pieces do you wish?
anya Halfrek!
halfrek Anyanka? Oh my god!
anya How are you, how are you?
xander_harris You two ... you know each other?
anya Funny, Halfrek, I didn't summon you to kill Xander, I called to invite you to our wedding.
halfrek Y- Oh my ... what an embarrassing mistake! Oh my god, gorgeous!
xander_harris Wow, um, you two clearly have some catching up to do. So I'll, uh ... I'll not be in the apartment.
anya Gosh, it's swell to see you again, Hallie, I didn't mean to have you materialize all the way here, I mean, not-not till the ceremony, I mean.
halfrek I guess I got the message garbled. You know how it is, half the time I have no idea if I'm maiming the right guy.
halfrek So, um ... you're marrying that man with the large upper arms?
anya Yes.
halfrek Why?
anya Well, because I love him.
halfrek Hmm.
anya Oh, we're gonna be very happy together.
halfrek Hmm.
anya What?
timothy It's boiling with nothing in it. Sometimes it does that.
timothy They say bugs fall in there. Oh, I'm back. You can go on your break now.
willow_rosenberg Come in.
amy_madison It's me. Dawn said I could come up.
amy_madison So, is she pissed at you too, or just me? What did you tell her about me?
willow_rosenberg D'you want something?
amy_madison Um ... yeah ... actually. I mean, I, I don't, don't know if you wanted to keep it, or...
willow_rosenberg You want it? Really?
amy_madison Well, yeah, you know, I mean ... it's not much, but it's home. Or it was. I don't know, I guess it's stupid, but...
willow_rosenberg No, i-it's not stupid. You can have it, of course.
amy_madison Hey. So I hear you got this whole cold-turkey thing goin' on. How's that going?
willow_rosenberg It's good. It's really good. I mean, i-it was hard at first ... frustrating ... doing everything the slow way. It was like, 'is everything gonna take forever, forever?'
amy_madison Yeah.
willow_rosenberg But, uh, it's better now. I'm ... getting my focus back.
amy_madison Mm. I can see that.
willow_rosenberg It's a pivotal page.
amy_madison So this is it, huh? This is ... gonna be your life from now on?
willow_rosenberg What? No.
amy_madison Well, you're never gonna do it again. Ever. You're never gonna ... feel how it made you feel.
willow_rosenberg Don't think that's the way to look at it.
amy_madison Hey Will? It's your birthday.
willow_rosenberg Um, no it isn't. But now that you mention it, Buffy's is coming...
._#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12
willow_rosenberg What?
willow_rosenberg Amy...
amy_madison It's a gift. It's magic ... and it didn't come from you. It came from me. Completely legal. Enjoy.
buffy_summers Look! Look what I found under the meat grinder!
manny Oh my god.
buffy_summers Wanna tell me what's going on?
manny I'm not sure.
buffy_summers Try again.
manny Well... there was an accident, maybe six weeks ago, a grinder incident.
buffy_summers Right, but see, *this* isn't six weeks old. This, is new.
manny It is? Oh... well, maybe Gary did come in this morning, or, I don't know, late last night, maybe there was an accident. Got himself to the hospital.
buffy_summers Right. Maybe he's in the hospital. Or maybe, he's in the grinder! Huh? Huh? Meat process, secret ingredient? Maybe, Gary's on the grill! Or maybe he's under the pickle chips!
manny Buffy. Buffy!
buffy_summers Stop! Stop! Everyone, you have to stop! Stop eating!
buffy_summers No, you can't have this! It's not beef! It's people!
buffy_summers The DoubleMeat Medley is people!
buffy_summers The meat layer is definitely people! It's people! It's people! Probably not the chickeny part. But who knows? Who! Knows!
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 What about the cherry pie?
manny What are you doing? I thought you were part of the team!
manny You are fired.
halfrek Tell me more about Xander.
anya You keep asking about him. Do you think I'm making a mistake?
halfrek Do you?
anya Well, no! Xander, he... He's very kind, and brave ... he has the sweetest smile and the nicest body, and ... he loves me. I mean, sometimes it isn't easy, but, he does.
halfrek Who told you that it isn't easy to love you?
anya Well, you know, I'll do something, or say something, and, and then he has to say stuff like, 'it's incorrect for you to appreciate money so much,' or, or, 'Observe: here is how a real human would behave.'
halfrek Oh, so he corrects you?
anya Well, no, it's just ... um ... well, no, I mean, now I'm all confused, I mean, wha, do you think there's something wrong with, with the way he treats me?
halfrek Do you?
anya Okay, you have to stop doing that. I love Xander.
halfrek Even though he thinks he knows better than you?
anya B-but he doesn't, he doesn't think that.
halfrek Okay. I'm sorry. I was just curious. You know, you don't have to say another thing about it if you're not comfortable.
anya B-but I am! I mean ... it's not like I'm hiding any deficiencies or anything.
halfrek Hmm.
xander_harris I have absolutely no threes. Go fish.
buffy_summers I call an emergency meeting, and this is it? Where's Willow? Where's Anya?
dawn_summers I-I couldn't find Willow. I knocked and knocked on her door.
xander_harris And Anya's entertaining a vengeance demon named Hallie. Say Buff, did you ever see Anya as a demon? 'Cause if that's it ... whoa.
buffy_summers There's something wrong at the DoubleMeat Palace. Really wrong.
dawn_summers Have you been demon-fighting? Is that why you smell funny?
buffy_summers No! I'm talking about...
buffy_summers Ucch. That's great. That's, that's just great. I try to do the simplest thing in the world, get an ordinary job in a well-lit place, and look, I'm right back where I started. Blood and death and funky smells. Look. Look what I found near the grinder.
dawn_summers Ew. Whose is it?
buffy_summers I don't know. It might be this guy named Gary, the only one in the whole place who didn't seem all brain-dead. He didn't show up this morning. Except now I think he was there the whole time. As the secret ingredient. We need to analyze that burger. We need to find out if it used to be people.
xander_harris What?!
xander_harris People?
buffy_summers Xander, you ate the burger?!
xander_harris Well, first you say it's cat, then you come in and hand me a burger, blah blah blah, five minutes later 'oh and by the way, it happens to be hot delicious human flesh'!
buffy_summers I needed that burger to analyze it. Now I'm gonna have to get another one.
xander_harris *That's* your problem with this scenario? You getting seconds?
willow_rosenberg Late! Late, sorry, I ... I was reading for school, well, highlighting anyway. Anyway, late.
xander_harris Yeah, you just missed the Gary burger.
willow_rosenberg What are we doing? Let's jump right in. Did Xander say something about food?
dawn_summers You wouldn't want any. Apparently the DoubleMeat Medley is people.
willow_rosenberg Whoa. Bad.
buffy_summers I bet it's not even just this one time. Or even this one town. There are DoubleMeat Palaces all over California.
dawn_summers I've eaten there a lot.
buffy_summers Well, everyone has! They've got the perfect deal. Everyone expects high turnover of the employees, they get the meat for nothing, and ... And they have us disposing of the bodies! How sick is that? We need to bring down the whole corporation. Will, Xander ate the burger, is there any way for sure to figure out what it was?
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah, I can start analyzing it with science, not ... I can use science. You ate it?
dawn_summers Um, we have the wrapper. There's little scribbles of meat on the wrapper.
buffy_summers Okay, good, you guys get working on that. It's after closing, so I'm gonna go there and see what I can find out.
willow_rosenberg Cool, you go. We'll be good.
dawn_summers Are you okay?
willow_rosenberg I'm just worried about Buffy.
willow_rosenberg She could be walking into anything.
buffy_summers Manny?
buffy_summers Ohh. Manny?
buffy_summers Guess you really were a lifer.
willow_rosenberg Don't need magic. Don't need it. Don't need it.
dawn_summers My friend Janice? Her sister's a lawyer.
xander_harris You think I should sue over the burger? That's interesting.
dawn_summers No, I just mean... Buffy's never gonna be a lawyer, or a doctor. Anything big.
xander_harris She's a Slayer. She saves the whole world. That's way bigger.
dawn_summers But that means she's gonna have like crap jobs her entire life, right? Minimum wage stuff. I mean, I could still grow up to be anything. But for her ... this is it.
xander_harris Okay, but maybe you'll be a lawyer or a doctor, and you can use all your money to support your deadbeat sister.
dawn_summers Oh, that's terrifically better. Thanks.
willow_rosenberg Hey, guys, I-I think I've got it.
xander_harris Good job, Will. Those aren't, like, potions, are they?
willow_rosenberg No, no potions. It's not magic, it's chemistry. You can tell by how damn slow it is.
willow_rosenberg I made a solution that reacts to the proteins in human blood. So we're pretty close to knowing for certain.
anya I'm here! I'm here.
dawn_summers We're doing chemistry.
anya Oh. So sorry I hurried.
xander_harris Hey, did your friend have a good time? And then leave?
anya She's gone.
xander_harris So, Ahn, the way she looked, with ... the face... That wasn't what you used to look like, was it?
anya Is there something wrong with that? I mean, did you think she was unattractive?
xander_harris Okay, is there any answer to that question that won't make you nuts?
anya Halfrek was always considered to be a great beauty.
xander_harris Well, hon, she was a little... ...there was some veinyness.
willow_rosenberg Hold this. Okay. If the solution reacts to the proteins, then I'll be able to see it. I mean, I'll be able to look through the microscope and, and then see it.
anya It's not like you're so perfect either, what with your ... strangely large upper arms and your tendency to criticize.
xander_harris Huh?
dawn_summers What do you see?
willow_rosenberg There's no reaction.
xander_harris Oh god, no! No reaction!
willow_rosenberg Which means it's not human.
xander_harris It's not human! It's not human?
anya Well, is it demony? I mean, maybe someone's ... you know, killing demons and using them as a cheap source of meat. I mean, we've all heard of that.
anya And by the way, I'm opposed to using demon meat, no matter how much money it saves. Does that surprise you?
xander_harris Again, I say 'huh?'
willow_rosenberg No, I'm not sure what I'm seeing. Cellulose?
willow_rosenberg There's something weird here.
buffy_summers Scalp?
buffy_summers Wig! Wig lady?
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Oh dear.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Wig lady, is that what they call me?
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 I don't care for that. I mean, I have to do something to hide this.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 It's paralyzing. Don't try to move, dear. You really can't, much.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 The paralysis spreads upward, by the way. You may want to flail your arms a bit while you still can.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Did I tell you? You're my favorite.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 DoubleMeat workers. You're all so full of DoubleMeat burgers, and you just slide down so smooth.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Oh, I just love the paralysis. It means I can eat you slowly.
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 I know you're under there.
willow_rosenberg Buffy? Are you in there?
willow_rosenberg I can't see you inside.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, if you're in there, the burger isn't people.
willow_rosenberg They aren't even meat, it's all processed vegetables. Isn't that weird?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, there's more. Something happened today ... i-it wasn't my fault. It was Amy's fault, but I feel so bad about it.
willow_rosenberg It was Amy's power, but, but it felt like I was doing everything myself. And I couldn't stop. And now it's gone and I feel kinda shaky and ... like I, I need it ... Buffy?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, something fell.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
WIG_LADY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode12 Visitors! How nice.
willow_rosenberg Missed me.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, are you all right?
buffy_summers Para...lyzed, but ... I think it's wearing off.
willow_rosenberg I did it! I killed it, Buffy, look!
buffy_summers@willow_rosenberg Ewwwww.
amy_madison Hey.
willow_rosenberg Amy.
amy_madison Can I come in? My new place isn't set up, and I wanted to borrow some stuff like detergent.
willow_rosenberg You really can't.
amy_madison I can't borrow detergent? Well, when they start calling me 'stinky Amy,' I'm just gonna say, 'hey, not my fault...'
willow_rosenberg I can't spend time with you anymore.
amy_madison What?
willow_rosenberg You can't come in here again.
amy_madison What's up, y-you didn't like your birthday present?
willow_rosenberg That's right.
amy_madison You're telling me that you didn't have a genuine blast? Come on, that was a sweet spell. That was like a trip to Disneyland without the lines.
willow_rosenberg You don't get it. What you did to me was wrong. Do you have any idea how much harder that makes, just, everything?
amy_madison You know what I notice? You're not denying that you had fun.
willow_rosenberg Shut up.
amy_madison Oh, yeah. Sharp argument you got there. Were you on the debate team? I forget. I forgot a lot while you were failing to make me be not a rat.
willow_rosenberg Amy. If you really are my friend ... you better stay away from me. And if you really aren't...
willow_rosenberg ...you *better* stay away from me.
lorraine_ross Yeah?
buffy_summers Hi. Uh, you must be the new manager. I-I'm Buffy Summers.
lorraine_ross I'm Lorraine Ross. They called me in when Manny did his disappearing act. You hear about that? Guy just disappeared.
buffy_summers Yeah. I think ... I think that used to happen a lot around here.
lorraine_ross Buffy Summers. I heard about you. Caused a big scene.
buffy_summers Oh, yeah. Practical jokes not really right for the workplace. I so get that now. Anyway, I just wanted to return my uniform.
lorraine_ross Oh. Most people don't even bother.
buffy_summers The DoubleMeat Medley ... is vegetables?
lorraine_ross How do you know that?
buffy_summers So I guess it's true.
lorraine_ross Um, close the door? Have a seat.
lorraine_ross It's a formed and texturized vegetable-based meat-like product, suitable for grinding. It's blended with large amounts of rendered beef fat for flavor.
buffy_summers Wait, the secret ingredient in the beef is ... beef?
lorraine_ross Buffy. You know something powerful here, do you understand that? The DoubleMeat reputation is built on a foundation of ... well, meat. You can't spread this around.
buffy_summers I get that. It's a valuable secret, isn't it?
lorraine_ross Is there something you want?
buffy_summers I really need money.
lorraine_ross You want money?
buffy_summers No! Well, I mean, yes, but, but no, I ... well, I, I want to work. See, I-I have zero money coming in, and there are expenses, and by the time I interview for a new job and get hired and go through a training process, it... well, I'd ... I'd really like to not be fired anymore.
lorraine_ross Well, I don't want any more practical jokes. I mean it.
buffy_summers I promise.
lorraine_ross Well, I'm a little short-handed right now, and you're already trained ... I think you can not be fired.
buffy_summers Thank you. That's, that's great. And I can do the job, I promise that too.
lorraine_ross I certainly hope so. I don't like short-timers, Buffy. I like people who *want* to be here. Maybe you didn't take this job seriously before, but from now on?
lorraine_ross See this? I want you to be shooting for this from here on out.
buffy_summers Right. Here on out.
