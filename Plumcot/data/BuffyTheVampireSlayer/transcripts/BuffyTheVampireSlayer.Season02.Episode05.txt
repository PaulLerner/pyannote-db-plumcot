xander_harris Is she dying?
buffy_summers I think she's singing.
xander_harris To a telephone in Hindi. Now that's entertainment!
xander_harris Why is she singing?
willow_rosenberg She's sad because her lover gave her twelve gold coins, but then the wizard cut open the bag of salt, and now the dancing minions have nowhere to put their big maypole... fish thing.
xander_harris Uh-huh. Why is she singing?
buffy_summers Her lover? I thought that was her chiropractor.
willow_rosenberg Because of that thing he did with her feet? No, that was personal.
xander_harris Hmm. And we thought just because we didn't have any money or anyplace to go this would be a lackluster evening.
willow_rosenberg I know! We could go to the Bronze and sneak in our own tea bags and ask for hot water.
xander_harris Hop off the outlaw train, Will, before you land us all in jail.
buffy_summers I, for one, am giddy and up. There's a kinda hush all over Sunnydale. No demons or vampires to slay, I'm here with my friends... So, how does the water buffalo fit in again?
richard_anderson Callie! Callie, where're you going? The party's just getting started.
cordelia_chase See? Dr. Debi says when a man is speaking you make serious eye contact, and you really, really listen, and you laugh at everything he says.
willow_rosenberg You dreamed about Angel again?
buffy_summers Third night in a row.
willow_rosenberg What did he do in the dream?
buffy_summers Stuff.
willow_rosenberg Oh! Stuff! Was it one of those vivid dreams where you could feel his lips and smell his hair?
buffy_summers It had surroundsound. I'm just thinking about him so much lately.
willow_rosenberg You two are so right for each other. Except for the, uh...
buffy_summers Vampire thing.
willow_rosenberg That doesn't make him a bad person. Necessarily.
buffy_summers I'm brainsick. I can't have a relationship with him.
willow_rosenberg Not during the day, but you could ask him for coffee some night. It's the non-relationship drink of choice.
willow_rosenberg It's not a date, it's a caffeinated beverage. Okay, sure, it's hot and bitter like a relationship that way, but...
xander_harris What's like a relationship?
buffy_summers Nothing I have. Coffee?
xander_harris Huh?
cordelia_chase There's really no comparison between college men and high school boys. I mean, look at that.
xander_harris So, Cor, you're datin' college guys now.
cordelia_chase Well, not that it's any of your business, but I happen to be dating a Delta Zeta Kappa.
xander_harris Oh! An extra-terrestrial. So that's how you get a date after you exhausted all the human guys.
cordelia_chase You'll go to college someday, Xander. I just know your pizza delivery career will take you so many exciting places.
buffy_summers Oh! I told Giles I'd meet him in the library ten minutes ago! Aw, he won't be upset. There hasn't been much paranormal activity lately.
rupert_giles Just because the paranormal is more normal and less... para of late is no excuse for tardiness or letting your guard down.
buffy_summers I haven't let my guard down.
rupert_giles Oh, really? You yawned your way through weapons training last week, you, you, you, you skipped hand-to-hand entirely... Are you gonna be prepared if a demon springs up behind you and does this?
rupert_giles Yeah, well, I'm, I'm not a demon. Which is why you should let go now.
rupert_giles Thank you.
rupert_giles When you live on top of a... a mystical convergence it's only a matter of time before a fresh hell breaks loose. Now is the time that you should train more strictly, you should hunt and patrol more keenly, you should hone your skills day and night.
buffy_summers And the little slice of life that still belongs to me from, I don't know, seven to seven-oh-five in the morning, can I do what I want then?
rupert_giles Buffy, you think I don't know what it's like to be sixteen?
buffy_summers No. I think you *don't* know what it's like to be sixteen. And a girl. And the Slayer.
rupert_giles Fair enough, no, no, I-I don't.
buffy_summers Or what it's like to have to stake vampires while you're having fuzzy feelings towards one?
rupert_giles Uh...
buffy_summers Digging on the undead doesn't exactly do wonders for your social life.
rupert_giles That's exactly where, where being... different, uh, comes in handy.
buffy_summers Right! Who needs a social life when you've got your very own Hellmouth?
rupert_giles Yes! Y-you, you, you have a duty, a-a-a purpose, y-y-you have a commitment in life. Now how many people your age can say that?
buffy_summers We talkin' foreign or domestic? How 'bout none?
rupert_giles Well, here's a hard fact of life: we all have to do things we don't like! And you have hand-to-hand this afternoon and patrol tonight. So I, I suggest you come straight here at the end of, of period six a-and you get your homework done. And don't dawdle with your friends. And, and don't think sitting there pouting is gonna get to me, because it won't.
rupert_giles It's not getting to me.
xander_harris Boy, what a long day.
willow_rosenberg And you skipped three classes.
xander_harris Yeah, and, of course, *they* flew by. Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Aren't you supposed to be doing your homework in the library?
buffy_summers I'm dawdling with my friends.
xander_harris Works for me.
buffy_summers You okay?
willow_rosenberg Jeez.
richard_anderson Cordelia.
cordelia_chase Hi, Richard. Nice car.
richard_anderson So, uh, we're having a little get-together tomorrow night at the house, and it's gonna be a really special evening.
richard_anderson Excuse me?
cordelia_chase Oh! I would, I would love, *love* to go!
richard_anderson So, who's your friend?
cordelia_chase Her? Oh, she's not my friend.
tom_warner She's amazing!
cordelia_chase She's more like a sister, really! We're that close.
richard_anderson Well, why don't you introduce us?
cordelia_chase Okay.
xander_harris Okay, so tonight, channel fifty-nine, Indian TV, sex, lies, incomprehensible story lines. I'll bring the betel nuts.
cordelia_chase Come on. Richard and his fraternity brother wanna meet you.
buffy_summers Well, I don't really wanna meet any fraternity boys.
cordelia_chase And if there was a God, don't you think he'd keep it that way?
xander_harris Uh, I-I believe we were dawdling here!
richard_anderson Hi, sweetheart. I'm Richard. And you are?
buffy_summers *So* not interested.
cordelia_chase Heh, she's such a little comedienne.
richard_anderson What, she likes to play hard to get?
tom_warner No, Richard. I think you're playing easy to resist.
tom_warner Ah, feel free to ignore him. I do all the time. I'm Tom Warner. I'm a senior at Crestwood College, and I... and I just feel like a complete dolt meeting you this way, so... here I stand in all my doltishness.
xander_harris Huh-huh-huh, right. Like she's gonna fall for that.
buffy_summers I'm Buffy Summers.
tom_warner Oh, nice to meet you. Are you a senior here?
buffy_summers Junior.
tom_warner Oh, me, too. Except that I'm a senior and I'm in college. So we have that in common, and... I major in history.
buffy_summers Mm. History stumps me. I have a hard enough time remembering what happened last week.
tom_warner No, nothin' happened last week, don't worry, I was there.
xander_harris She's gonna walk away. Now.
tom_warner So, uh, my friend invited your friend to a party we're having this weekend.
tom_warner You know, actually he's not even really my friend. I only joined the fraternity because my father and grandpa were in it before me. Y'know, it meant a lot to them.
xander_harris Okay, boots, start a-walking.
tom_warner Oh, I know, I talk too much anyway. They're really dull parties full of really dull people, so... would you like to come and save me from a really dull fate?
buffy_summers Oh, I wish I could, but I'm sort of involved.
tom_warner Well, sure, of course you are. Well, thanks for letting me ramble.
buffy_summers Y'know, people underestimate the value of a good ramble.
rupert_giles Buffy!
buffy_summers Oh, I gotta go. It was nice to meet you.
tom_warner Oh. Same here.
xander_harris I hate these guys. Whatever they want just falls into their laps. Don't you hate these guys?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, with their charmed lives and their movie star good looks and more money than you can count? I'm hating.
rupert_giles I'm going to attack you. A word of warning: for your own good, I won't be pulling any punches.
buffy_summers Please don't.
rupert_giles Good. So, um, you're on patrol and, uh, I'll see you in the morning.
angel There's blood on it.
buffy_summers Hi. It's nice to... Blood?
angel I can smell it.
buffy_summers Oh. It's pretty thin. It probably belonged to a girl.
angel Probably.
buffy_summers I-I was... just thinking, wouldn't it be funny some time to see each other when it wasn't a blood thing. Not funny ha, ha.
angel What are you sayin', you wanna have a date?
buffy_summers No.
angel You don't wanna have a date?
buffy_summers Who said 'date'? I-I-I never said 'date'.
angel Right. You just wanna have coffee or somethin'.
buffy_summers Coffee?
angel I knew this was gonna happen.
buffy_summers What? What do you think is happening?
angel You're sixteen years old. I'm two hundred and forty-one.
buffy_summers I've done the math.
angel You don't know what you're doing, you don't know what you want...
buffy_summers Oh. No, I, I think I do. I want out of this conversation.
angel Listen, if we date you and I both know one thing's gonna lead to another.
buffy_summers One thing already has led to another. You think it's a little late to be reading me a warning label?
angel I'm just tryin' to protect you. This could get outta control.
buffy_summers Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
angel This isn't some fairy tale. When I kiss you, you don't wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.
buffy_summers No. When you kiss me I wanna die.
cordelia_chase Buffy! Did you lose weight? And your hair... Alright, I respect you too much to be dishonest. The hair's a little... Well, that really isn't the point here, is it? The Zeta Kappas have to have a certain balance at their party, and Richard explained it all to me, but I was so busy really listening that I didn't hear much. Anyway, the deal is they need you to go. And if you don't go, I can't. And I'm talking about Richard Anderson, okay? As in Anderson Farms, Anderson Aeronautics and Anderson Cosmetics. Well, you see why I *have* to go. Buffy, these men are rich. And I am *not* being shallow. Think of all the poor people I could help with all my money!
buffy_summers I'll go.
cordelia_chase You'll go? Great! I'll drive. Oh, Buffy, it's like we're sisters! With really different hair.
richard_anderson I pledge my life and my death...
pledge I pledge my life and my death...
richard_anderson To the Delta Zeta Kappas, and to Machida whom we serve...
pledge To the Delta Zeta Kappas, and to Machida whom we serve...
richard_anderson On my oath before my assembled brethren...
pledge On my oath before my assembled brethren...
richard_anderson I promise to keep our secret from this day until my death.
pledge I promise to keep our secret from this day until my death.
richard_anderson In blood I was baptized. In blood I shall reign. In his name.
pledge In blood I was baptized, and in blood I shall reign. In his name.
richard_anderson You are now one of us.
pledge In his name!
Brothers#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode05 In his name.
richard_anderson Brewski time!
richard_anderson So what's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
callie_anderson Let me go.
richard_anderson Let you go? Okay, let me think. Um, no! God, I love high school girls. Mm!
willow_rosenberg You're going to the fraternity party? What made you change your mind?
buffy_summers Angel.
willow_rosenberg He's going with you? She's got a date with Angel! Isn't that exciting?
xander_harris I'm elated.
buffy_summers I-I'm not going with Angel. I'm going with ye gods Cordelia.
willow_rosenberg Cordelia?! Did I sound a little jealous just then, 'cause I'm not really... Cordelia?!
xander_harris Cordelia's much better for you than Angel.
willow_rosenberg What happened with Angel?
buffy_summers Nothing, as usual. A whole lotta nothing with Angel.
xander_harris Bummer.
willow_rosenberg I don't understand. I mean, he likes you. More than likes.
buffy_summers Angel barely says two words to me.
xander_harris Don't you hate that?
buffy_summers And when he does, he treats me like I'm a child.
xander_harris That bastard!
buffy_summers You know, at least Tom can carry on a conversation.
xander_harris Yeah! Tom? Who's Tom?
willow_rosenberg The frat guy.
xander_harris Oh, Buffy, I don't think so. Frying pan, fire? You know what I'm sayin'.
rupert_giles Will you be ready if a vampire's behind you?
rupert_giles I didn't see you three... creeping about.
rupert_giles Um, how did it go last night?
buffy_summers Found this.
rupert_giles E-N-T.
willow_rosenberg I've seen something like that before.
buffy_summers It's broken in two. I don't know what the rest of the letters might have spelled. And there's blood on it.
rupert_giles Uh, I didn't see any.
buffy_summers Angel showed up. He could smell it.
xander_harris The blood? There's a guy you wanna party with.
rupert_giles Blood.
willow_rosenberg In Sunnydale. What a surprise.
xander_harris Okay, here's what we're gonna do: she should probably make the rounds again tonight, and we should try to figure out who that bracelet belongs to.
rupert_giles Yes, good idea, yes. She'll patrol, and, and we'll reconvene...
buffy_summers Uh, hello? She's standing right here? And she's not available.
rupert_giles Why not?
xander_harris Buffy, this is a little more important than...
buffy_summers I've got a mountain of homework to do, and, um... my mom's not really feeling well, and she could probably use my help, and, um, to be truthful I'm not really feeling all that well myself.
rupert_giles Oh, w-w-well, um, sorry, of course. If-if-if you're not well.
buffy_summers Oh, I'll take an early pass this evening, and, um, one later on, but for the bulk of the evening...
rupert_giles Oh, you should stay home with your mother.
buffy_summers Well, say it.
xander_harris I'm not gonna say it.
willow_rosenberg You lied to Giles.
xander_harris 'Cause she will.
buffy_summers Look, I wasn't lying. I was just... protecting him from information that he wouldn't be able to... digest properly.
xander_harris Like a corn dog.
willow_rosenberg Like you don't have a sick mother, but you'd rather go to a frat party where there's gonna be drinking and older guys and probably an orgy.
xander_harris Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho, rewind. Since when do they have orgies, and why aren't I on the mailing list?
buffy_summers There's no orgies!
willow_rosenberg I heard a lot of wild things go on at frat parties.
buffy_summers Okay, you know what? Look, seven days a week I am busy saving the world. Once in a great while I wanna have some fun. And that's what I'm gonna have tonight. Fun!
cordelia_chase This isn't about fun. This is about duty, your duty, to help me achieve permanent prosperity. Okay? Do's and dont's: don't wear black, silk, chiffon or spandex. These are my trademarks. And don't do that weird thing with your hair.
buffy_summers What weird thing with my...
cordelia_chase Don't interrupt. Do be interested if someone should speak to you. It may or may not happen, but do be polite. And laugh at the appropriate intervals. Do lie to your mom about where we're going. It's a fraternity, and there will be drinking.
xander_harris So, Cor, you printing up business cards with your pager number and hours of operation, or just going with a halter top tonight?
cordelia_chase Oh, are we feeling a little envious? You could belong to a fraternity of rich and powerful men. In the Bizarro world.
buffy_summers Do you guys wanna join us?
xander_harris Nah, I gotta... digest and all.
cordelia_chase Makeup, makeup... Well, give it your all, and keep to the shadows. We're gonna have a blast!
willow_rosenberg I can't believe she lied to Giles. My world is all askew.
xander_harris Buffy's lying, Buffy's going to frat parties... That's not askew, that's cockeyed.
willow_rosenberg Askew means cockeyed.
xander_harris Oh.
willow_rosenberg Well, there's nothing we can do about it. We'll help Giles.
xander_harris I'm goin' to the party.
willow_rosenberg What?
xander_harris I gotta keep an eye on Buffy. Those frat guys creep me.
willow_rosenberg You wanna protect her?
xander_harris Mm-hm.
willow_rosenberg And prove that you're just as good as those rich, snotty guys?
xander_harris Mm-hm.
willow_rosenberg Maybe catch an orgy?
xander_harris If it's on early.
cordelia_chase Ohh! Why do they park so darn close to you? Are you ready for this?
buffy_summers I dunno. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
cordelia_chase Me, too. Let's go!
cordelia_chase C'mon!
tackle Beaucoup babes!
linebacker Ooo, yeah!
cordelia_chase You know what's so cool about college? The diversity. You've got all the rich people, and all the other people. Richard!
richard_anderson Welcome, ladies.
cordelia_chase Thank you.
buffy_summers Oh, i-is there alcohol in this?
richard_anderson Just a smidge.
cordelia_chase C'mon, Buffy, it's just a smidge.
buffy_summers I'll just...
richard_anderson I understand. When I was your age I wasn't into grownup things either. Have you seen our multi-media room?
cordelia_chase Oh, the one with the cherry walnut paneling and the two forty-eight-inch televisions on satellite feed? No. Wanna show me?
richard_anderson What about...
cordelia_chase Oh, her? She's happiest by herself.
xander_harris Cheers!
tackle New girl!
young_man Easy, man!
tackle Dance!
tackle C'mon, sweetheart, ha, ha, yeah!
tom_warner Can I have this dance?
tackle C'mon!
buffy_summers Thanks.
tom_warner No. We're not all a bunch of drunken louts. Some of us are sober louts.
tom_warner I'm really glad that you decided to come.
tom_warner And you're not.
buffy_summers No, it's... I shouldn't be here.
tom_warner Because you're seeing someone.
buffy_summers No.
tom_warner You're not seeing someone?
buffy_summers Someone's not seeing me.
tom_warner So, why shouldn't you be here?
buffy_summers Because I have obligations. People that I'm responsible for, or to, or... with, or... It's complicated.
tom_warner You're big on responsibility. I like that. But there's such a thing as being too mature.
tom_warner You should relax. Enjoy yourself once in a while.
buffy_summers You think I'm too mature?
tom_warner I talk too much. Have you picked up on that yet?
tom_warner Anyway, the, uh, the Hulk is gone, so you don't have to dance with me.
buffy_summers He might come back.
xander_harris Godzilla's attacking downtown Tokyo! Argh! Argh!
tackle Who's this dork?
richard_anderson Never seen him before in my life.
linebacker We got us a crasher!
xander_harris So, have either of you seen a pair of girls here? One's about so high... Hey, guys!
tackle New pledge.
linebacker New pledge!
tackle New pledge!
Together#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode05 New pledge! New pledge! New pledge! New pledge! New pledge!
tom_warner You okay?
buffy_summers Yeah. I was... just thinking.
richard_anderson To my Argentinean junk bonds that just matured into double digits!
tom_warner Uh, to maturity.
buffy_summers What the hell. I'm tired of being mature.
willow_rosenberg Bent.
rupert_giles Sent.
willow_rosenberg Rent.
rupert_giles Uh, Lent. Dent.
willow_rosenberg Went. Kent. Kent! That's it!
rupert_giles Her boyfriend's name was Kent?
willow_rosenberg No! Kent Preparatory School. Just outside of town. That's where I've seen these bracelets.
rupert_giles Wh-what are you doing?
willow_rosenberg Pulling up their school newsletter for the past few months. See if there's anything about...
rupert_giles A missing girl.
tackle C'mon, dance, pretty boy!
tackle Keep it movin'! C'mon! Shake it, don't break it! Wrap it up and I'll take it!
xander_harris Okay, big fun guys. Uhhh, who's next?

tackle Oh! Keep it up! Yes! C'mon! Keep it goin'! Ah, ha!
buffy_summers Tom?
buffy_summers Ooo! Ooo, sorry...
buffy_summers Okay. Nice bed. Just need to stop spinning for at least...
tom_warner Get away from her!
richard_anderson I wasn't doing anything!
tom_warner I saw what you were doing.
richard_anderson I was just having a little fun.
tom_warner Well, she's not here for your fun, you pervert. She's here for the pleasure of the one we serve.
richard_anderson In his name.
tom_warner And that goes for the other one, too.
rupert_giles Callie Megan Anderson. Missing for over a week. No one's seen her, no one knows what happened to her.
willow_rosenberg This being Sunnydale and all I guess we can rule out something good.
rupert_giles I'm calling Buffy.
willow_rosenberg No!
rupert_giles Why not?
willow_rosenberg Because Buffy... a-a-and her mother...
rupert_giles Are sick. No, you're quite right. No, there's no point in disturbing them until we know more.
willow_rosenberg You mean, like, if there're others? Brittany Oswald, junior at St. Michael's, disappeared a year ago. So did Kelly Percell, sophomore at Grant.
rupert_giles A year.
willow_rosenberg Almost to the day.
rupert_giles An anniversary or perhaps some other event significant to the killer.
willow_rosenberg Killer? Now there's a killer? We don't know that there's a...
rupert_giles No, but this being Sunnydale and all.
willow_rosenberg Gulp.
rupert_giles We need to know where Buffy found that bracelet, and then we can begin our search there.
willow_rosenberg Good idea. Call Angel. Uh, he was there when Buffy found it. We're gonna need all the help we can get.
linebacker Party's over, jerkwater.
xander_harris Wait, a friend of mine was here.
tackle Y'know, in that light, with that wig on and all... you're still butt-ugly!
cordelia_chase Buffy? Where are we?
buffy_summers In the basement, far as I can tell.
cordelia_chase What's happening? What did they do to us?
buffy_summers They drugged us.
cordelia_chase Why? What are they gonna do to us?
buffy_summers I don't know.
cordelia_chase I wanna go home.
callie_anderson No one's going home. Ever. Look, one of them's different than the others. Nicer.
buffy_summers Tom.
callie_anderson He's the one to watch out for.
tom_warner She's last.
cordelia_chase Last? For what?
cordelia_chase Who's first?! Answer me! Who's first?!
buffy_summers Three stones. Three of us.
cordelia_chase Buffy...
buffy_summers Stay calm. We'll get outta this.
cordelia_chase Why'd I ever let you talk me into coming here?
angel She found the bracelet in the cemetery. Near the south wall.
rupert_giles South wall.
rupert_giles What are you doing?
willow_rosenberg Oh! Sorry. The reflection thing that you don't have. Angel, how do you shave? South wall. That's near the college and... the fraternity house!
rupert_giles A fraternity?
angel Could they be taking these girls? Let's get out there!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
rupert_giles Wwwe don't know that it's concrete. Uh, let's not disturb her until...
willow_rosenberg Is there! With Cordelia. They went to a party at the Zeta Kappa house.
rupert_giles She lied to me?
willow_rosenberg Well...
angel Did... she have a date?
willow_rosenberg Well... Well, why do you think she went to that party? Because you gave her the brush-off! And you never let her do anything except work and patrol! And I know she's the Chosen One, but you're killing her with the pressure! I mean, she's sixteen going on forty! And you! I mean, you're gonna live forever! You don't have time for a cup of coffee?!
willow_rosenberg Okay, I don't feel better now, and we've gotta help Buffy.
xander_harris One day I'll have money. Prestige. Power. And on that day they'll still have more.
tom_warner Machida.

cordelia_chase What are they, some kind of cult or something?
buffy_summers Yeah, a psycho cult.
cordelia_chase You've gotta do something.
tom_warner It's been a year since our last offering.
tom_warner A year in which our bounty overflowed. We come before you with fresh offerings.
cordelia_chase Offerings? He's talking about us?
callie_anderson Do you see anyone else chained up in here?
tom_warner Accept our offering, Dark Lord, and bless us with your power. Machida!

Brothers#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode05 In his name. Machida.
cordelia_chase There's something down there and he's gonna throw us down there with it.
buffy_summers I don't think so.
cordelia_chase No? Well, that's good! That, that's...
buffy_summers I don't think we go to it. I think it comes to us.
cordelia_chase Ooohhhhhhh! No!
cordelia_chase Oh, my God!
cordelia_chase C'mon, Buffy! Oh, my God! Oh, c'mon! Oh!
tom_warner For he shall rise from the depths, and we shall tremble before him.
tom_warner He who is the source of all we inherit and all we possess. Machida.

tom_warner And on the tenth day of the tenth month he shall be enhungered. And we shall feed him.
cordelia_chase Feed him?
cordelia_chase Feed him?!
cordelia_chase Oh, no!
willow_rosenberg Looks like everyone's gone.
angel Hey!
xander_harris Hey! What are you guys doing here?
willow_rosenberg A bunch of girls are missing, and the Zeta Kappas may be involved, and Buffy. Are you wearing makeup?
xander_harris No. I think Buffy's still inside somewhere with Cordelia. Her car's still here.
rupert_giles Why are you wearing that?
xander_harris Oh, I found it in their trash. I saw them through the window. They were wearing robes and went down to the basement. I was gonna use it to sneak in.
rupert_giles They may be involved in some kind of ritual.
willow_rosenberg With the missing girls.
angel With Buffy!
xander_harris Okay, that *is* the guy you wanna party with.
buffy_summers Hey, reptile boy!
tom_warner No woman speaks to him!
buffy_summers You don't want her. Look at her. She's all skin and bones. Half an hour later you'll be hungry.
tom_warner I told you to shut up!
tom_warner You speak again and I'll cut your throat.
xander_harris Got locked out dumping the trash. Let me in. I don't wanna miss the, uh...
tackle Come on.
xander_harris ...you know what. Where are they?!
tom_warner Something's going on upstairs. Go. Go!
tom_warner Feed, Dark Lord!
xander_harris That's for the wig! That's for the bra!
willow_rosenberg Some guy's attacking Buffy with a sword! Also there's a really big snake!
xander_harris That's for the makeup! And that's for the last sixteen and a half years!
willow_rosenberg Guys! Buffy! Snake! Basement! Now!
tom_warner You bitch! I'll serve you to him in pieces.
buffy_summers Tom, you talk too much.
buffy_summers Let her go, wormy!
cordelia_chase You did it! You saved us! I've never been so happy to see anyone in my whole... You guys. I just... hate you guys! The weirdest things always happen when you're around!
cordelia_chase And you! You're going to jail for fifteen thousand years!
buffy_summers I told one lie, I had one drink.
rupert_giles Yes, and you were very nearly devoured by a giant demon snake. The words 'let that be a lesson' are a tad redundant at this juncture.
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
rupert_giles So am I. I... I drive you too hard because I-I know what you have to face. From now on no, no more pushing, no more prodding. Just, uh, an inordinate amount of nudging.
jonathan_levinson C'mon, hurry!
Barmaid#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode05 Here you go.
cordelia_chase Thank you, Jonathon. Did we forget something?
jonathan_levinson Um... Cinnamon, chocolate, half-caf, nonfat.
jonathan_levinson Extra foam!
cordelia_chase Young men are the only way to go.
xander_harris Says here that they've all been sentenced to consecutive life sentences. Investigators found the bones of missing girls in a huge cavern beneath the frat house. And older bones dating back fifty years.
xander_harris A surprising number of corporations whose chairmen and founders are former Delta Zeta Kappas are suffering from falling profits, IRS raids... Ooo, and suicides in the boardroom. Hmm. Starve a snake, lose a fortune. Boy, I guess the rich really are different, huh?
willow_rosenberg Have you heard from Angel? When he got so mad about you being in danger, and changed into a grr, it was the most amazing thing I ever saw. I mean, how many guys can...
xander_harris Angel, Angel, Angel. Does every conversation we have have to come around to that freak? Hey, man, how you doin'?
angel Buffy.
buffy_summers Angel.
xander_harris Xander!
angel I hear this place, uh, serves coffee. I thought maybe you and I should get some. Sometime. If you want.
buffy_summers Yeah. Sometime. I'll let you know.
