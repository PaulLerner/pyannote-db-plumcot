riley_finn We're not expecting anyone, are we?
buffy_summers Willow said she was going to be at the science library allnight.
riley_finn Is that right?
buffy_summers Uh, apparently not.
willow_rosenberg We got trouble.
buffy_summers What is it?
willow_rosenberg I was in the rec room. It came through the window.
riley_finn Vampire?
willow_rosenberg Vampires don't breathe fire.
riley_finn I should call for backup.
buffy_summers No time.
buffy_summers We have to make this fast. I have better things to do tonight than kill.
all@ SURPRISE!!!
willow_rosenberg Guess you won't be killing anything tonight,after all.
buffy_summers Don't be so sure.
rupert_giles Yeah, this is a lively space. It's like the activity room we had at public school.
rupert_giles Sorry I,uh, one time I, uh, I was up to a little bit of a prank with the dart board
anya I'm bored. Let's eat.
xander_harris Anya, we've talked about this.
anya I'm sorry, that was rude. Please continue your story.
rupert_giles Go and eat.
willow_rosenberg Giles! Hi. Are you having a goodtime?
rupert_giles Yes. Yes. There's, uh, a lot of new faces here, aren't there?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. Mostly kidsfrom the dorm. A couple of Riley's friends.
buffy_summers Hi, Giles.
rupert_giles Buffy. HappyBirthday.
buffy_summers Thank you.
rupert_giles Nineteen. It's hard to believe, isn't it?
buffy_summers There's somebody here I want you to meet. Uh, this is Riley Finn . . .. my boyfriend.
riley_finn It's very nice tomeet you, Mr. Giles. Did you help planthis? It was quite a surprise.
rupert_giles The first of many. Uh, been . . . dating long?
buffy_summers Giles was the librarian at my high school.
riley_finn Ah, I've seen the library. It's gone down hill since you left.
rupert_giles Yes. I-I-I'm embarrassed to say that I actually miss it at times.
riley_finn So, you're retired?
rupert_giles I'm sorry?
riley_finn Or . . . you're working somewhere else now?
rupert_giles Well, not, uh . . . sort of betweenprojects, uh, right now, uh, it's apersonal
buffy_summers Oh! Oh, look. Gileshas no cake.
riley_finn Oh, here. Here, I'llget you a piece.
buffy_summers Oh, he's just nervous. But this is so nice. Having everyone together for my birthday. Ofcourse, you could smash in all my toes with a hammer and it will still be thebestest Buffy Birthday Bash in a big long while.
rupert_giles Right. A-a-actually,Willow a-a-and Xander did all the planning. I'm not sure I would have gone withthe surprise party. You know,you have enough things jumping out at you in the dark.
buffy_summers Professor Walsh says that adrenaline is like exercise butwithout the exorbitant gym fees.
rupert_giles Very whitty.
buffy_summers You should meet her. She's absolutely the smartest person I've ever met.
rupert_giles Perhaps we should have invitedProfessor Walsh to the party?
buffy_summers Oh, no. I mean,she's like forty. She's got better things to do than hang out with a bunch ofkids.
riley_finn Here you go, sir.
xander_harris You own nothing. This shouldn't be taking solong.
spike Hang on. Let a fella get organized.
xander_harris That's my radio!
spike And you're what? Shocked and disappointed? I'm evil!
anya So, what kind of place are you lookingfor?
spike I don't know. Maybea crypt. Some place, you know, dark and dank. But not as dark and dank as this.
anya Heh. It's prettydepressing, isn't it?
spike I've known corpses with a fresher smell. In fact, I've beenone.
xander_harris That's it! Let'sgo.
anya Wait. I want to give you something for your new place.
xander_harris That's my lamp.
anya A gift is traditional. I've read about it.
xander_harris That's among friends. With bitter enemies we don't give them my lamp.
spike It's not gonna have electricity anyway. It's a crypt, remember?
anya What about running water? A fridge to keep your blood fresh?
spike No.
anya Well, that's gotta suck. You should just get a hotel room or something.
spike Demon girl's got a point. I need fresh blood. If I had a few bob for a room with an honorbar
xander_harris Out! Before I getthe Slayer over here to kick your ass out!
spike Don't know why she didn'tcome. Say good-bye, shed a few tears.
xander_harris Well, she has an appointment with somebody who's actuallystill *scary*!
professor_maggie_walsh So, the Slayer.
buffy_summers Yeah. That's me.
professor_maggie_walsh We thought you were a myth.
buffy_summers Well, you were myth-taken.
professor_maggie_walsh And to think all that time you were sitting in myclass. Well, most of those times. I always knew you could do better than a Bminus. Now I understand your energies were directed in the same places as ours,in fact. It's only our methods thatdiffer. We use the latest in scientifictechnology and state-of-the-art weaponry and you, if I understand correctly,poke them with a sharp stick.
buffy_summers Well, it's more effective than it sounds.
professor_maggie_walsh Oh, , I'm, heh, quite sure of that. As I'm just as sure thatwe can learn much from each other. I'mworking on getting you clearance to come into the Initiative. I think you'llfind the results of our operation most impressive. Agent Finn here, alone, haskilled or captured how many is it?
riley_finn Seventeen. Eleven vampires, six demons.
buffy_summers Oh . . . Wow. I mean, that's . .. seventeen.
professor_maggie_walsh What about you?
buffy_summers Me?
professor_maggie_walsh How many hostiles would you say you've slain?
rupert_giles Third new moon after the . . . nine-hundredth feast ofDelthrox. Oh, crap.
rupert_giles No, we can't wait for her, Willow. The demon Prince Barvainis going to rise tonight. Well Whereis she, exactly?
riley_finn Wow.
buffy_summers Those are my best stories. And I didn't tell you theBuffy breaks her butt stories.
riley_finn But you've killed a You did the thing with that Uh, youdrowned. And the snake! Not to mention the . . daily . . slayageof Wow.
buffy_summers It's no big, really. Hey, who wants ice cream!
riley_finn Buffy. When I sawyou stop the world from, you know, ending . . . I just assumed that was a bigweek for you. Turns out I suddenly find myself . . . needing to know the pluralof apocalypse.
buffy_summers Look. If you've beenfighting since you were fifteen you'd have a hefty resume' too.
riley_finn Fifteen!?
buffy_summers I know, wow. The point is, that, that we have different amounts of experience.You know. And plus, I do have thatwhole preternatural Slayer strength deal.
riley_finn I've seen. Don't get me wrong. The girls I grew up with could hold their own. But . . . I'm not even sure I could takeyou.
buffy_summers That all depends on your meaning.
professor_maggie_walsh Yeah?
rupert_giles Professor Walsh, I presume. You're hard to find.Thesethese halls are quite the labyrinth. I felt like Theseus and the Minotaur in the . . . labyrinth.
professor_maggie_walsh Can I help you with something, Mr. . . . ?
rupert_giles Giles. Rupert. I'm looking for Buffy Summers. I'm,uh, a friend of hers. And I was her high school librarian.
professor_maggie_walsh I'm sorry, Buffy's not here. But if I see her . . .
rupert_giles Buffy's been very influenced by your cause. She quotes you quite often.Sometimes she sounds like an introductory textbook herself.
professor_maggie_walsh I don't lecture from the textbook. But I'm glad she's inspired bythe material. She's bright. All she'sreally been lacking is encouragement in the academic sect.
rupert_giles Oh, uh, I think it's best if-if. . . if we let a youngperson find their own strengths. If you lead a child by the hand then they'llnever find their own footing.
professor_maggie_walsh And if it's true about hiking, ergo, it must be true aboutlife.
rupert_giles That's not, uh . . . I'm just saying Buffy is, uh, well she's not the typicalstudent. Once you get to know her, she's a very unique girl. I hope you're not going to push her.
professor_maggie_walsh I think I do know her. And I have found her to be a unique woman.
rupert_giles Woman. Of course. How wrong of me tochoose my own words.
professor_maggie_walsh She's very self-reliant, very independent
rupert_giles Exactly!
professor_maggie_walsh which is not always a good thing. I think it can be unhealthy to take on adult roles too early. What Isuspect I'm seeing is a reaction to the absence of a male role model.
rupert_giles Absence?
professor_maggie_walsh Buffy clearly lacks a strong father figure.
professor_maggie_walsh I'm sorry, I have things to do. I'll tell Buffy her *friend* was looking for her.
willow_rosenberg This prince/demon guy was supposed to rise at sunset soaren't we, like, late?
rupert_giles Of course if I hadn't had to search the globe for our MissSummers and do battle with that harridan. . . .
xander_harris And if you hadn't gotten lost on campus afterwards . . .
rupert_giles Never mind. I'll just have to take care of it myself. I've vanquished a few demons in my daywithout her. Of course, it wouldn't surprise me if we're entirely toolate. Demon on the loose, carnageeverywhere.
xander_harris Your better demons will clean up after themselves.
rupert_giles I don't understand. Umm, there should be ruptured earth and-and broken stone. Oh, well, apparently it hasn't happenedyet. A bit of luck.
willow_rosenberg Or, you know what I bet? I-I bet the Initiative took careof it.
rupert_giles Who?
xander_harris Oh, Riley and his guys. Probably all over it.
willow_rosenberg Yeah. It has thattoo neat look. They musthave cleaned up the place.
rupert_giles What?
willow_rosenberg Oh, they read hot spots. Areas of otherworldy energy.They must've picked this place up days ago.
rupert_giles Stop, both of you. Uh, what, uh . . . What are you talkingabout? W-what's the Initiative? What. . . what on earth does it have to dowith Buffy's new boyfriend?
willow_rosenberg You know. I'm sureyou know. Riley's one of the commandos.
rupert_giles What?! Well that's marvelous, isn't it? Here I am, spentweeks trying, uh, t-to get a single scrap of information about our mysteriousdemon collectors and no one bothers to tell me that Buffy's dating one ofthem?! Who else knows?!
xander_harris No one. No one elseknows this. Anya, and that's it!
willow_rosenberg And Spike.
rupert_giles Ssspike?! Spike knew?
xander_harris Only the basic stuff. You know, that Riley is a commando and Professor Walsh is in charge.
rupert_giles Professor Walsh!? That fishwife!?
willow_rosenberg You know, she's actually not that bad once you get toSo, th-the demon is probably a little late. W-we'll just,you know
rupert_giles Oh, forget it. Go on. You two clear off. I'll juststay a little longer just in case.
willow_rosenberg You sure? 'Cause we can stay.
rupert_giles No. Go.
rupert_giles Who am I kidding?
rupert_giles Nothing is gonna happen.
ethan_rayne I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that at all.In fact, Ripper, old mate, I'd say something rather interesting was about tohap
rupert_giles Did someone?
ethan_rayne Oh, bugger! I thought you'd gone!
rupert_giles Ethan Rayne. Youhave no idea how much thrashing you is gonna improve my day.
ethan_rayne No, no, no! Wait! Hang on! You-you can beat thecrap out of me. Go ahead, I can't stop you! Or-oryou can listen to what I have to say. Find out what's going on.
rupert_giles What are you talking about?
ethan_rayne Something bad is happening. Bad for both of us.
rupert_giles Bad for you.
ethan_rayne No, no, no! Listen! You have to listen! You're going to need time to prepare!
ethan_rayne Brilliant! Now isn'tthis more fun than kicking my ass?
rupert_giles No.
ethan_rayne Oh. It's more funfor me.
rupert_giles Just tell me what you want to tell me.
ethan_rayne Oh, so crass. We used to be friends, Ripper. When did all that fall apart?
rupert_giles The same time you started to worship chaos.
ethan_rayne Oh, religious intolerance. Sad, there. I mean, just look atthe Irish troubles. Oh, hang on, I'lltell ya. Something happening in the darkworlds. It'salways been rumors out there but . . . only one thing's coming through clear..That something's harming demons and it's not the Slayer. Know anything aboutit?
rupert_giles What are they saying?
ethan_rayne Heh, you know demons. It's all exaggeration and blankverse. Pain as bright assteel things like that. They're scared. There's something called314 that's got them scared most of all. The kind of scared thatturns to angry. I know we're not particularly fond of each other, Rupert. But we are a couple of old mystics. This knewoutfit, it's blundering into new places it doesn't belong. It's throwing theworlds out of balance. And that's way beyond chaos, mate. We're headed quiteliterally for one hell of a fight.
riley_finn Are you pulling back?
buffy_summers Are you?
riley_finn Maybe a little.
buffy_summers Maybe a little, too.
riley_finn I'll go all out if you will.
buffy_summers Are you sure?
riley_finn Here we go.
buffy_summers Riley!
buffy_summers Are you hurt?
riley_finn I, uh, I don't think so.
buffy_summers I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean to, uh
riley_finn It's fine. I'm good.
rupert_giles You know what gets me? This is what gets me. Twenty years I've beenfighting demons. Maggie Walsh and herNancy-ninja boys come in and six months later, demons are pissing themselveswith fear. They never even noticed me.
ethan_rayne Who's Maggie Walsh?
rupert_giles Oh, she's awful. She said I was an absent male role model.Absent my ass. I'm twice the man she is.
ethan_rayne You know you're really very attractive.
rupert_giles Hm?
ethan_rayne Here's my name and number. You give me acall, I'll show you a good time.
waitress Yeah, thanks.
rupert_giles We gotta face it, we've changed. We'll not you . . . you're still sadistic and self-centered.
ethan_rayne Here's to me.
rupert_giles The world has past us by. Someone snuck in and left us a couple of has-beens in our place. ThisInitiative, I mean, their methods may be causing problems, but they're gettingthe job done. Where am I? I'm anunemployed librarian with a tendency to get knocked on the head.
ethan_rayne Well, we won't have to worry about that anymore now,mate. When you went tothe loo I slipped a small pellet of poison in your drink. You'll be dead in an hour.
ethan_rayne Just kidding!
rupert_giles I'm gonna feel like hell in the morning.
ethan_rayne Relax. Enjoy thenight. We're just a couple of sorcerers. The night is still our time. Time of magic.
rupert_giles To magic.
willow_rosenberg I'm glad you wanted to gettogether. I know it's late.
tara_maclay Thanks. I was happy you called.
willow_rosenberg We'll start out slow.
tara_maclay Okay.
tara_maclay Willow?
willow_rosenberg Yeah?
tara_maclay Start out slow doing what?
willow_rosenberg Oh. We're gonna float the rose. Then use the majiks to pluck the petals off,one at a time. It's a test of synchronicity. Our minds have to be perfectly attuned to work as a single delicateimplement.
tara_maclay Cool.
willow_rosenberg And it should be very pretty.
tara_maclay It worked.
willow_rosenberg Now for the hard part. The petals.
willow_rosenberg What the heck was that?
tara_maclay I don't know, but, uh, the petals are off.
rupert_giles I feel like hell in the morning.
rupert_giles Uh! Wha WhaNo!
rupert_giles Damn!
rupert_giles Ethan.
rupert_giles Oh, and I liked that shirt!
buffy_summers I like pancakes 'cause they're stackable. Ooo, and waffles 'cause you can put things in the little holes if youwanted to.
willow_rosenberg You should always have a new boyfriend. You're so much fun right now.
buffy_summers Hey. I didn't hearyou come in last night. Where were you?
willow_rosenberg The chem lab, by myself. I-I was tryingthis new spell; floating a rose, when all of a sudden zing,zing, zing! Like all over the room. Itwas like a rose-based missile.
buffy_summers Yikes.
willow_rosenberg I know. I thinkthere's something out there. I-I felt this presence.. This dark majiks energyblocking the spell. It's new.
buffy_summers Someone else doing majiks?
willow_rosenberg Maybe. If so, it'ssomeone pretty powerful.
buffy_summers Hmm. I'll tell Gilesabout it. Or maybe I'll tell Maggie. She seemed kind of interested in learningthe mystical side of the whole demon hunting biz.
willow_rosenberg Tell Giles. He's feeling a little hurt right now. How come you never told him about Riley being a commando?
buffy_summers I did. I didn't?
willow_rosenberg He says no. He'sfeeling neglected and out-of-the-loopy.
buffy_summers Well, I didn't at first because Riley said not to. And . .and then meow cat out of the bag and I-I guess I just forgot thathe didn't know. I'll make it up to him when I see him. Tomorrow. I'm spending today with Riley.
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah. I forgotthat's what you always do on the days when the earth rotates.
buffy_summers It's just going so well, right now. I think. I hope. I sort of kicked him acrossthe room last night.
willow_rosenberg Uh, that's not good.
buffy_summers Well, we were sparring and he said not to hold back. And he's a little dented. But he said he was okay with it and I thinkhe's okay with it do-do you think he's okay with it?
willow_rosenberg I'm sure he is. Imean, if he's not . . . you know, you had to do it. He's right. You can't walk around pretending you're lessthan you are. It wouldn't be right for you to hold back.
buffy_summers Right.
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers I held back a little.
rupert_giles Still asleep? It's ten thirtyin the morning.
rupert_giles Xander. Xander, wake up.
xander_harris Mom?
rupert_giles No, it's not mum. Now, when you look at me . . . you may bea little alarmed but there's no need, it-it's me. Giles. Now, Ethan has turnedme into a demon and I need your help.
rupert_giles Hello. Yes, it's me.
xander_harris AHHH!
rupert_giles Xander, listen! Don't you understand me?
xander_harris Demon! Demon!
rupert_giles Please, don't you understand? No, no! Don't! Xander!Xander, calm down! Ow! You're just alittle overwrought. Oww!
xander_harris That's right! Runfor your life!
rupert_giles Oh, God. I'm sorry!
mother Call 911!
rupert_giles Bloody humans!
buffy_summers So it had pointy things. What kind of pointy things?
xander_harris The pointy kind. And tufty ears. Oh, and it might have a sauce pan shape bruise.
willow_rosenberg Giles will know what it . . . was.
buffy_summers Giles?
buffy_summers Looks like Xander wasn't the only one to get a visitortoday.
xander_harris He's not upstairs.
willow_rosenberg Oh, God, Giles.
buffy_summers Okay. There's ademon and Giles is gone. But it doesn'tmean that he's hurt. I mean, there's no blood anywhere so maybe the demon justtook him somewhere?
anya I think it ate him up.
spike Well. What do I spywith my little eye? A demon. That would be . . . oh, right . . . the things I can kill.
rupert_giles Spike. Wonderful. A perfect end to a perfect day.
spike Giles?
rupert_giles Go on, then. Let's get on with the fighting Youunderstand me?
spike Of course I understand you.
rupert_giles I'm speaking English?
spike No, you're speaking Fyarl. I happen to speak Fyarl. And . .. by the way, why the hell are you suddenly a Fyarl demon? You just come overall demony this morning?
rupert_giles As a matter of fact, I did. Thanks to Ethan Rayne. You have to help me find him. He must undothis and then he needs a . . . goodbeing killed.
spike And I'm just supposed to help you out of the evilness of myheart?
rupert_giles Y-you help me and I-I don't kill you.
spike Oh, tremendously convincing. Try it again without thestutter.
rupert_giles Money. I could payyou money.
spike Oh, I like money. Howmuch?
rupert_giles A h-hundred dollars.
spike A hundred dollars? You'll have to do a lot better thanthat. Two-hundred.
rupert_giles Fine.
spike Right, then.
rupert_giles Right, then.
spike So what's first? I run and tell the Slayer whatyou've gotten yourself into?
rupert_giles No. When I find Ethan I can clear all this up without Buffyever having to find out that anything happened to me at all.
xander_harris Okay, that's a giant vulture. I'd have mentioned it if it was a giant vulture.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, even if we figure out what kind of demon got GilesI mean, how are we gonna find it?
buffy_summers We'll figure it out. Oh, this onehas tufty ears.
willow_rosenberg What was that?
riley_finn Buffy?
buffy_summers Riley. What are you doing here?
riley_finn There were 911 calls from a couple of different places.Including here.
xander_harris You get 911 calls?
riley_finn We have a tap into the system. It flags things with possible nonhuman causes. We check them out. Whatare you doing here?
buffy_summers This is Giles' apartment. He's missing. The calls, did anyone see what did it?
riley_finn Negative. No. Neighbors just heard, you know, growling,things breaking. Sounded like a struggle.
willow_rosenberg Poor Giles.
buffy_summers We'll get him back.
riley_finn What are you working on?
buffy_summers Uh, we have stuff. Pictures . . .
anya We have nothing.
riley_finn I'll help. The whole Initiative. We'll do whatever you need.
buffy_summers Thanks. I just wish I knew what I needed. I keep thinking,let's ask Giles and then I remember.
xander_harris He'd be great right now. He'd find himself in a second.Nobody is cooler in a crisis.
rupert_giles If you can't find third gear, don't try for third gear!
spike I'm doing my best. Idon't know if I'm driving this thing or wearing it.
rupert_giles It's perfectly serviceable.
spike Funny hearing a Fyarl demon say serviceable.Had a couple of them working for me once. They're more like Like tocrush. Crush now? Strongthough. You won't meet a jar you can'topen for the rest of your life.
spike What was that? Did you growl?
rupert_giles No. Listen, about this Fyarl demon. Do-do I have specialpowers? Like setting things on fire with my sizzling eye beams?
spike Well, you got the mucous thing.
rupert_giles What? Mucous?
spike Paralyzing mucous. Shoots out through the nose. Sets on fast. Hard as a rock. Pretty good in a fight.
rupert_giles Are you making this up?
spike Maybe. But hey, you feel a sneeze coming on, youwarn me.
rupert_giles Turn here.
rupert_giles Down shift! Down shift!
spike Calm down, will you?
rupert_giles I'm not sure I can. I feel like I'm changing.
spike Fine with me. So long as you pay me.
rupert_giles I really like this feeling. Sort ofmindless need to destroy. This anger and rage.
spike Good times. Go with it.
rupert_giles No.
spike Oh, it's fun. I can't do it, do it for me. Now let yourself go.
rupert_giles I refuse to become a monster because I look like a monster.I have a soul. I have aconscience. I am a human being. Oh, stop the car!
rupert_giles Right. Let's go, then.
xander_harris That's the thing that attacked me.
willow_rosenberg A Fyarl demon. Sortof a foot soldier type, works for other demons lots of the times. Very strong .. . ugh! And hey, mucous.
buffy_summers Mucous?
riley_finn Agent Finn, go ahead.
buffy_summers How do I kill it?
willow_rosenberg Silver. A weapon made of silver.
riley_finn Yes. I understand.The demon attacked Professor Walsh. Got out of a small, graycar. A Citroen.
willow_rosenberg It stole Giles' car.
xander_harris Why would a demon steal a car?
anya Why would a demon steal *that* car?
buffy_summers A demon that steals a car has a reason. A purpose. But itdoesn't sound like these Fyarl demons are really big independent thinkers. So,Will, the spells that are going wrong . . . could they be caused by someoneusing majiks to control a demon? Making this Fyarl demon attack Giles?
willow_rosenberg Yes. Yeah, thatwould draw in a lot of dark energy.
buffy_summers Okay. Willow, Xander: stay here. Who's ever controlling this demon may call and askfor a ransom. Give them anything theywant.
xander_harris You got it.
buffy_summers Riley, you and I are going to the magic shop. Maybe they needed supplies. Uh, somethingsilver . . .
riley_finn A letter opener? It's not very sharp.
buffy_summers Then I'll have to put some muscle behind it.
spike Two of them. English like me. But older, less attractive. One of them gave you hisnumber.
waitress I threw it out. I mean, I took one look and saw that hewas staying at that rat trap. Nothanks.
spike Which rat trap?
waitress The one by the highway. The Sunnydale Motor Inn.
spike Thank you.
buffy_summers Okay. Credit card slips, sales receipt. Help me look.
riley_finn You shouldn't have done that to the door.
buffy_summers I do not have time to play by the rules tonight.
riley_finn I have a master key. It opens every shop on Main Street.
buffy_summers Oh. Well . . . next time, absolutely.
riley_finn I don't know what I'm looking for.
buffy_summers I do. Ethan Rayne.
riley_finn Who's that?
buffy_summers At least we know who we're looking for.
riley_finn Command, are you there?
buffy_summers What are you doing?
riley_finn It's agent Finn. I need a search. Local hotelregistrations matching the name Ethan Rayne. R-A-Y-N-E. Call me back.
buffy_summers You can do that?
riley_finn It'll take a couple of minutes.
buffy_summers Get in the car. Beready to go.
riley_finn Buffy. Earlier, when I talked toProfessor Walsh, she gave me very specific orders.
buffy_summers Yeah?
riley_finn She said when we located the demon I . . . I'm not supposedto bring you along.
buffy_summers Oh.
riley_finn Uh, what are you doing?
buffy_summers I'm *going* to the car.
riley_finn Buffy, I can't take you with me.
buffy_summers You're not taking me with you. I am going and I am letting you come along.
riley_finn Buffy, it's not really your call. This is a militaryoperation now.
buffy_summers Then call out the troops. Because nothing less than that is gonna stop me. This demon did something to Giles and I'mgonna kill it.
spike How ya feeling, mate?
rupert_giles Like snapping necks until everyone isdead.
spike Now that sounds like a Fyarl demon. Good for you.
spike Hey, picked up a tail.
rupert_giles Yes. Just a little one. It hurts when I sit.
spike I mean someone is following us. Humvee. Military.
rupert_giles Well speed up. Lose them.
spike I got it floored. Why'd you buy this car?
rupert_giles Well do something. If they catch us, we'll both end up in a lab!
spike It's getting closer.
spike And it's got a friend!
rupert_giles Damn!
spike Oh, sure! Dismantlethe getaway car. That'll scare them.
rupert_giles Then slow down and I'll jump out. They'll follow you.
spike Hold on. These commandos. They're the same guys that areafter me too.. Maybe I want you aroundto split their attention a bit?
rupert_giles I'll pay you another hundred dollars.

rupert_giles For me?
buffy_summers Oh, God! Giles!
buffy_summers Oh, God! Giles! Giles! I'm soI'm so sorry!Please don't die!
rupert_giles Actually, I feel quite well. Except for the rage.
buffy_summers I think he's okay. Iis this thing real silver?
ethan_rayne I really got to learn to just do the damage andget out of town. It's the stayand gloat that gets me every time.
buffy_summers You okay?
rupert_giles Oh, um, uh, embarrassed, mostly. Ethan's wardrobe's not helping any. Uh, how did you know it was me?
buffy_summers Your eyes. You're the only person in theworld that can looked *that* annoyed with me.
ethan_rayne Is this gonna go on much longer? I'd rather like to begoing.
buffy_summers And why would I let you go?
ethan_rayne Well, maybe because you have no choice. I'mhuman, you can't kill me. What's aSlayer going to do to me?
riley_finn By the authority of the US military,you're being taken into custody pending a determination of your status.Take it from here.
riley_finn They'll, uh, take Mr. Rayne to a secret detention facilityin the Nevada desert. I'm *sure* he'll be rehabilitated in no time.
rupert_giles Uh, if you don't mind, I'm just gonna go andwatch them manhandle him into a vehicle.
buffy_summers Thanks.
riley_finn I told you I'd help.
buffy_summers You did. If I'd had gotten here any later and if Giles hadkilled Ethan, I . . . never would have gotten him back.
riley_finn You'd find some other way. You're reallystrong. Like Spider-Man strong.
buffy_summers Yeah. But I don'tstick to stuff. But . . yeah.
riley_finn And you're in charge. You're like, make the plan, executethe plan. No one giving you orders.
buffy_summers I'm the Slayer.
riley_finn I like it.
buffy_summers Yeah?
riley_finn But give me another . . oh . . week to get ready. And I'lltake you down.
buffy_summers Nice phone.
rupert_giles Yes. Fabulous technology. See, if anyone has information Ineed to know, they can, uh, simply tell me about it. Through this ingenious speaking tube. I'm very excited.
buffy_summers I am sorry, Giles. Ireally thought I told you about Riley and the Initiative. And I know that it doesn't help. Look, Ipromise it won't happen again. I willtell you everything.
rupert_giles Buffy, Idon't want to ask you to betray any confidences, and I certainly don't want tointerfere
buffy_summers Uh-oh, you have but-face. You look like you're gonna say but.
rupert_giles But . . . this, um, Initiative, I'm-I'm a littleconcerned. Ethan's not exactly areliable source but, um . . . I'm not sure that he's wrong about them.
buffy_summers I'm not dating the Initiative. I'm dating Riley. He's a good guy.
rupert_giles And I-I believe that. But he's part of something we-we don'treally understand.
buffy_summers You sure you're not just saying this because youdon't like Riley's boss?
rupert_giles No! No. I'm not saying that at all. Though I do . . . hate her quitea lot. But I want you to have your personal life, but . . . keep your eyesopen. Make sure you know what you're getting into.
professor_maggie_walsh So she walks in and the rules just suddenly break?
riley_finn Umm . . . pretty much.
professor_maggie_walsh Be careful with her. She reacts on instinct. There's nodiscipline there. Her loyalties are uncertain.
riley_finn You won't be disappointed in her. She's good at what she does. She is the truest soul I've everknown.
professor_maggie_walsh Oh, no oh, no! Spontaneous poetic exclamations. Lord, spare me college boys in love.
riley_finn I'm just saying she'll work out. You'll be proud of her.
professor_maggie_walsh You want to know what I think? I think you'reprobably right.
