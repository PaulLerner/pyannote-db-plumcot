angel Passion.
angel It lies in all of us.
angel Sleeping...
angel ...waiting... And though unwanted...
angel ...unbidden... it will stir...
angel ...open its jaws, and howl.
angel It speaks to us... guides us... Passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have?
buffy_summers He was in my room.
rupert_giles Who?
buffy_summers Angel. He was in my room last night.
rupert_giles Are you sure?
buffy_summers Positive. When I woke up, I found a picture he'd left me on my pillow.
xander_harris A visit from the pointed-tooth fairy.
cordelia_chase Wait, I thought vampires couldn't come in unless you invited them in.
rupert_giles Yes, but, uh, once you've invited them in, thereafter they're, they're always welcome.
xander_harris Y'know, I think there may be a valuable lesson for you gals here about inviting strange men into your bedrooms.
cordelia_chase Oh, God! I invited him in my car once. That means he can come into my car whenever he wants.
xander_harris Yep, you're doomed to havin' to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they feel like it. And those guys never chip in for gas.
buffy_summers Giles, there has to be some sort of spell to reverse the invitation, right? Like a barrier, a no shoes, no pulse, no service kind of thing?
cordelia_chase Yeah, that works for a car, too?
rupert_giles Yes, well, I-I-I could check on my...
xander_harris Hello!
xander_harris Excuse me, but have you ever heard of knocking?
jonathan_levinson We're supposed to get some books. On Stalin.
xander_harris Does this look like a Barnes & Noble?
rupert_giles This is a school library, Xander.
xander_harris Since when?
rupert_giles Uh, y-yes, yes, uh, third row. Historical biographies.
jonathan_levinson Thanks.
rupert_giles What... Oh!
jonathan_levinson Hey, did you say that was the... Hello?
rupert_giles So Angel has decided to step up his harassment of you?
cordelia_chase By sneaking in her room and leaving stuff at night? Why doesn't he just slit her throat or strangle her while she's sleeping or cut her heart out? What? I'm trying to help.
rupert_giles Yes. Uh, uh, look, it's-it's classic battle strategy to throw one's opponent off his game. He-he-he's just trying to provoke you. Uh, to taunt you, to, to goad you into, uh, some mishap of some sort.
xander_harris The nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah approach to battle?
rupert_giles Yes, Xander, once more you've managed to boil a complex thought down to its simplest possible form.
buffy_summers Giles, Angel once told me that when he was obsessed with Drusilla, the first thing h-he did was to kill her family.
xander_harris Your mom.
buffy_summers I know. I'm gonna have to tell her something. The truth?
rupert_giles No. You-you-you-you can't do that.
xander_harris Yeah. The more people who know the secret, the more it cheapens it for the rest of us.
buffy_summers But I've gotta tell her something. I've gotta do something. Giles, Angel has an all-access pass to my house, and I'm not always there when my mother is. I can't protect her.
rupert_giles I told you I will find a-a spell.
buffy_summers What about *until* you find a spell?
cordelia_chase Until then, you and your mother are welcome to ride around with me in my car.
rupert_giles Buffy, I-I understand your concern, but it's imperative that you keep a level head through all this.
buffy_summers That's easy for you to say. You don't have Angel lurking in your bedroom at night.
rupert_giles I know how hard this is for you. All right, I don't. But as the Slayer, you don't have the luxury of being a slave to your, your passions. You mustn't let Angel get to you. No matter how provocative his behavior may become.
buffy_summers So what you're basically saying is, 'just ignore him, and maybe he'll go away'?
rupert_giles Yes. Precisely.
xander_harris Hey, how come Buffy doesn't get a snotty 'once again you boil it down to the simplest form' thing?
xander_harris Watcher's pet.
jenny_calendar Don't forget, I need your sample spreadsheets by the end of the week.
jenny_calendar Oh, and I want both a paper printout and a copy on disk. Thank you.
jenny_calendar Willow.
willow_rosenberg Yes?
jenny_calendar Um, I might be a little late tomorrow. Do you think you could cover my class till I show?
willow_rosenberg Really? Me? Teach the class? Sure!
jenny_calendar Cool.
willow_rosenberg Oh, wait. W-what if they don't recognize my authority? What if they try to convince me that you always let them leave class early? What if there's a fire drill? What if there's a fire?
jenny_calendar Willow, you're gonna be fine. And I'll try not to be too late, okay?
willow_rosenberg Okay. Good. Earlier is good. Will I have the power to assign detention? Or make 'em run laps?
buffy_summers Hey, Will.
jenny_calendar Hi, Buffy. Rupert.
buffy_summers Willow, I thought I might take in a class. Figured I could use someone who knows where they are.
willow_rosenberg Sorry. I have to talk to her. She's a teacher, and teachers are to be respected, even if they're only filling in until the real teacher shows up, because otherwise chaos could ensue...
jenny_calendar How have you been?
rupert_giles Uh, not so good, actually. Uh, since Angel lost his soul, he's regained his sense of whimsy.
jenny_calendar Well, that sounds bad.
rupert_giles He's been in Buffy's bedroom. I-I-I need to drum up a spell to, uh, keep him out of the house.
jenny_calendar This might help. I've been doing a little reading since Angel changed. I don't think you have that one.
rupert_giles Thank you.
jenny_calendar So, how's Buffy doing?
rupert_giles How do you think?
jenny_calendar I know you feel betrayed.
rupert_giles Yes. Well, that's one of the unpleasant side effects of betrayal.
jenny_calendar Rupert... I was raised by the people that Angel hurt the most. My duty to them was the first thing I was ever taught. I didn't come here to hurt anyone, a-and I lied to you because I thought it was the right thing to do. I... I didn't know what would happen. I didn't know I was gonna fall in love with you.
jenny_calendar Oh, God. Is it too late to take that back?
rupert_giles Do you want to?
jenny_calendar I just wanna be right with you. I don't expect more. I just want so badly to make all this up to you.
rupert_giles I understand. But I'm not the one you need to make it up to.
rupert_giles Thank you for the book.
joyce_summers Okay. What's wrong?
buffy_summers It's nothing.
joyce_summers Come on. You can tell me anything. I've read all the parenting books. You cannot surprise me.
buffy_summers Do you remember that guy Angel?
joyce_summers Angel, the, um... the college boy who was tutoring you in history?
buffy_summers Right. Uh, he... I-I... Oh, God. Um... We're sort of dating, *were* dating, um, going through a serious off-again phase right now.
joyce_summers Don't tell me. He's changed. He's not the same guy you fell for?
buffy_summers In a nutshell. A-anyway, um... since he changed, he's been kinda following me around. He's having trouble letting go.
joyce_summers Buffy, has he done anything...
buffy_summers No! No, it's not like that. He's just been hanging around... a lot. Just sending me notes, that kind of thing. I just don't wanna see him right now. I mean, if he shows up, I'll talk to him. Just... don't invite him in.
willow_rosenberg I agree with Giles. You need to just try and not let him get to you. Angel's only doing this to try to get you to do something stupid. I swear, men can be such jerks sometimes. Dead or alive.
buffy_summers I just hope Giles can find a keep-out spell soon.
buffy_summers I know I'll sleep easier when I can... sleep easier.
willow_rosenberg I'm sure he will. He's like book-man. Until then, try and keep happy thoughts and...
buffy_summers And what?
buffy_summers Willow?
buffy_summers Willow?
willow_rosenberg Thanks for having me over, Buffy. Especially on a school night and all.
buffy_summers No problem. Hey, sorry about your fish.
willow_rosenberg Oh, it's okay. We hadn't really had time to bond yet. Although for the first time I'm glad my parents didn't let me have a puppy.
buffy_summers It's so weird... Every time something like this happens, my first instinct is still to run to Angel. I can't believe it's the same person. He's completely different from the guy that I knew.
willow_rosenberg Well, sort of, except...
buffy_summers Except what?
willow_rosenberg You're still the only thing he thinks about.
drusilla I brought something for you. Poor thing. She's an orphan. Her owner died... without a fight. Do you like her? Hmm? I brought her especially for you... to cheer you up. And I've named her... Sunshine! Open wide. Come on, love. You need to eat something to keep your strength up. Now, rrrrr, open up for mummy.
spike I won't have you feeding me like a child, Dru.
angel Why not? She already bathes you, carries you around and changes you like a child.
drusilla Why, Angel. Where have you been? The sun is almost up, and it can be so hurtful. We were worried.
spike No, we weren't.
drusilla You must forgive Spike. He's just a bit testy tonight. Doesn't get out much anymore.
angel Well, maybe next time I'll bring you with me, Spike. Might be handy to have you around if I ever need a really good parking space.
spike Have you forgotten that you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?
angel And as a guest, if there's anything I can do for you... Any... responsibility I can assume while you're spinning your wheels... Anything I'm not already doing, that is.
spike That's enough!
drusilla Aww...
drusilla You two boys... fightin' over me and all. Makes a girl feel...
spike Dru, what is it, pet?
drusilla The air. It worries. Someone... an old enemy is seeking help... help to destroy our happy home. Ohhhh...
shopkeeper Welcome. How may I serve you today?
jenny_calendar Uh...
shopkeeper Love potion? Perhaps a voodoo doll for that unfaithful...
jenny_calendar I need an Orb of Thesulah.
shopkeeper Oh, you're in the trade. Sorry about the spiel, but around Valentine's Day, I get a lot of tourists shopping for love potions and mystical revenge of past lovers. Sad fact is, Ouija boards and rabbits' feet, that's what pay the rent around here. So how did you hear about us?
jenny_calendar My Uncle Enyos told me about you.
shopkeeper So you're Janna, then. Sorry to hear about your uncle.
jenny_calendar Thank you.
shopkeeper He was a good customer. Well, no, there you go. One Thesulan Orb. Spirit vault for the rituals of the undead. I don't get many calls for those lately. Sold a couple as new age paperweights last year. Yeah, I just love those new-agers, boy. They helped to send my youngest to college. By the way, you do know that the transliteration annals for the ritual of the undead were lost. Without the annals, the surviving text is gibberish.
jenny_calendar And without a translated text, the Orbs of Thesulah are pretty much useless. Yeah, I know.
shopkeeper Well, I only mention it because I have a strict policy of no refunds.
jenny_calendar It's okay. I'm working on a computer program to translate the Rumanian liturgy to English based on a random sampling of the text.
shopkeeper Yecchh. I don't like computers. They give me the willies.
jenny_calendar Well, thank you.
shopkeeper You're welcome.
shopkeeper By the way... Not that it's any of my business, really, but, uh, what are you planning on conjuring up? If you can decipher the text?
jenny_calendar A present for a friend of mine.
shopkeeper Really? What are you gonna give him?
jenny_calendar His soul.
buffy_summers We'll be in hiding, probably...
buffy_summers Siberia.
xander_harris Well, good morning, ladies. And what did you two do last night?
willow_rosenberg We had kind of a 'pajama party sleepover with weapons' thing.
xander_harris Oh. And I don't suppose either of you had the presence of mind to locate a camera to capture the moment.
willow_rosenberg I have to go. I have a class to teach in about five minutes, and I have to arrive early to glare disapprovingly at the stragglers. Oh, darn. She's here. Five hours of lesson planning yesterday down the drain...
buffy_summers You know what? I'll see you in class.
buffy_summers Hey.
jenny_calendar Hi.
jenny_calendar Uh, is there something that... Did you want something?
buffy_summers Look... I know you feel badly about what happened, and I just wanted to say...
buffy_summers Good. Keep it up.
jenny_calendar Don't worry, I will.
buffy_summers Oh, wait. Um... He misses you. He doesn't say anything, I mean, but I know he does. And I don't want him to be lonely. I don't want anyone to.
jenny_calendar Buffy, you know that if I have a chance to make this up...
buffy_summers We're... good here. Let's just leave it.
rupert_giles I put it here somewhere. Oh, yes, yes. That's it. Could you, um, hang those up? Thank you. Buffy. So, uh, so how was your night?
buffy_summers Sleepless, but no human fatalities.
rupert_giles I-I found a ritual to revoke the invitation to vampires.
cordelia_chase Oh, thank goodness. I actually had to talk my grandmother into switching cars with me last night.
rupert_giles Um, the-the-the, uh, the ritual's fairly basic, actually. It's just the recitation of a few rhyming couplets, burning of, uh, moss herbs, sprinkling of holy water...
buffy_summers All stuff I have in my house.
rupert_giles Hanging of crosses...
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna have a hard time explaining this to my dad.
buffy_summers You really think it'll bother him?
willow_rosenberg Ira Rosenberg's only daughter nailing crucifixes to her bedroom wall? I have to go over to Xander's house just to watch 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' every year.
buffy_summers I see your point.
willow_rosenberg Although it is worthwhile to see him do the Snoopy Dance.
cordelia_chase Willow, are you aware that there are no fish in your aquarium?
buffy_summers You know, Cordelia, we've already done your car. Call it a night if you want.
cordelia_chase Right. Thanks. And you know I'd do the same for you if you had a social life.
cordelia_chase Oh. This must be for you.
willow_rosenberg It's for you.
buffy_summers Mom.
angel Mrs. Summers, I need to talk to you.
joyce_summers You're Angel.
angel Did Buffy tell you about us?
joyce_summers She told me she wants you to leave her alone.
angel I-I can't. I can't do that.
joyce_summers You're scaring her.
angel You have to help me. Joyce... I need, I need to be with her. Y-you can convince her. You have to convince her.
joyce_summers Look, I'm telling you to leave her alone.
angel You have to talk to her for me, Joyce. Tell her I need her.
joyce_summers Please, look, I-I just wanna get inside, okay?
angel You don't understand, Joyce. I'll die without Buffy. She'll die without me.
joyce_summers Are you threatening her?
angel Please... Why is she doing this to me?
joyce_summers I'm calling the police now.
angel I haven't been able to sleep since the night we made love.
angel I need her. I know you understand.
joyce_summers Just leave us alone.
willow_rosenberg 'Hicce verbis consensus rescissus est.'
Translation#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode17 By these strong unanimous words is rescinded.
buffy_summers Sorry, Angel. Changed the locks.
rupert_giles Hello.
jenny_calendar Oh! Hi.
rupert_giles You're working late.
jenny_calendar Special project.
rupert_giles Oh.
jenny_calendar I spoke to Buffy today.
rupert_giles Oh! Yes?
jenny_calendar Mm. She said you missed me.
rupert_giles Well, uh, she's... a meddlesome girl.
jenny_calendar Rupert... Okay, I don't wanna say anything if I'm wrong, but I may have some news. Now, I need to finish up here. Could I see you later?
rupert_giles Y-yes, yes. You could stop by my house.
jenny_calendar Okay.
rupert_giles Good.
shopkeeper Sorry, honey. We're closed.
shopkeeper W... What do you want?
drusilla Miss Sunshine here tells me you had a visit today. But she worries. She wants to know what you and the mean teacher talked about.
jenny_calendar Come on, come on...
jenny_calendar That's it! It's gonna work! This... will work.
jenny_calendar Angel... How did you get in here?
angel I was invited. The sign in front of the school... 'Formatia trans sicere educatorum.'
jenny_calendar 'Enter all ye who seek knowledge.'
angel What can I say? I'm a knowledge seeker.
jenny_calendar Angel, I-I-I've got good news.
angel I heard. You went shopping at the local boogedy-boogedy store. The Orb of Thesulah. If memory serves, this is supposed to summon a person's soul... from the ether... store it until it can be transferred.
angel You know what I hate most about these things?
angel They're so damn fragile. Must be that shoddy gypsy craftsmanship, huh?
angel I never cease to be amazed how much the world has changed in just two and a half centuries.
angel It's a miracle to me. You, you put the secrets to restoring my soul in here...
angel It comes out here. 'The Ritual of Restoration.' Wow. This, this brings back memories.
jenny_calendar Wait. That's your...
angel Oh, my cure? No, thanks. Been there, done that, and deja vu just isn't what it used to be. My... Isn't this my lucky day. The computer... and the pages. Looks like I get to kill two birds with one stone.
angel And teacher makes three.
jenny_calendar No!
angel Oh, good. I need to work up an appetite first.
angel Sorry, Jenny, this is where you get off.
angel Ah... I never get tired of doing that.
rupert_giles Willow, good evening.
willow_rosenberg Hi. Come on in. Here's the book.
rupert_giles Right. I guess I should do my apartment tonight. The ritual go all right?
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah. It went fine. Well, it went fine until Angel showed up and told Buffy's mom that he and Buffy had... Well, you know, that they had... you know. You do know, right?
rupert_giles Oh, yes. Yes. Sorry.
willow_rosenberg Oh, good, 'cause I just realized that being a librarian and all, you maybe didn't know.
rupert_giles Oh, thank you. I got it.
willow_rosenberg You would have been proud of her, though. She totally kept her cool.
willow_rosenberg Okay, well, I'll tell Buffy you stopped by.
rupert_giles Would you, um... Perhaps I should intervene on, on Buffy's behalf w-w-with her mother. Um, maybe... say something?
willow_rosenberg Sure! Like, what would you say?
rupert_giles W... Uh...
rupert_giles You will tell Buffy I dropped by?
willow_rosenberg You bet.
buffy_summers That stuff with the Latins and the herbs, uh, he's just real superstitious.
joyce_summers Oh.
buffy_summers We just thought if...
joyce_summers Was he the first? No, wait. I don't wanna know. I don't think I want to.
buffy_summers Yeah. He was the first. I mean, the only.
joyce_summers He's older than you.
buffy_summers I know.
joyce_summers Too old, Buffy. And he's obviously not very stable. I really wish... I just thought you would show more judgment.
buffy_summers He wasn't like this before.
joyce_summers Are you in love with him?
buffy_summers I was.
joyce_summers Were you careful?
buffy_summers Mom, this is no time...
joyce_summers Don't 'Mom' me, Buffy. You don't get to get out of this. You had sex with a boy you *didn't* even see fit to tell me you were dating.
buffy_summers I made a mistake.
joyce_summers Yeah, well, don't just say that to shut me up, because I think you really did.
buffy_summers I know that! I-I can't tell you everything.
joyce_summers How about anything? Buffy, you can shut me out of your life, I am pretty much used to that. But don't expect me to ever stop caring about you, because it's never gonna happen. I love you more than anything in the world. That would be your cue to, uh, roll your eyes and tell me I'm grossing you out.
buffy_summers You're not.
joyce_summers Oh, well... I guess that was the talk.
buffy_summers So how'd it go?
joyce_summers I don't know. It was my first.
rupert_giles Hello?
rupert_giles Jenny?
rupert_giles It's me!
policeman Mr. Giles, I need to ask you to come with us. Just to answer a few questions.
rupert_giles Of course. Yes. Procedure. I need to make a phone call... if that's all right.
rupert_giles Yes.
angel Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love... the clarity of hatred... and the ecstasy of grief.
buffy_summers Hello. Giles, hey! We did the, the thing. It worked. What?
willow_rosenberg Giles?
willow_rosenberg What? No! No! Noooo!
buffy_summers Where's Giles?
xander_harris No luck. By the time we got to the station, the cops said he'd already left. I guess they just wanted to ask him some questions.
buffy_summers Cordelia, will you drive us to Giles' house?
cordelia_chase Of course.
willow_rosenberg But don't you think he wants to be left alone?
buffy_summers I'm not worrying about what he wants. I'm worried about what he's gonna do.
xander_harris Hello? Giles?
xander_harris I guess Giles had a big night planned tonight.
buffy_summers Giles didn't set this up. Angel did. This is the wrapping for the gift.
xander_harris Oh, man. Poor Giles.
willow_rosenberg Look, all his weapons are gone.
cordelia_chase But I thought he kept his weapons at the library.
xander_harris No, those are his, uh, everyday weapons. These were his good weapons. The ones he, uh, breaks out when company comes to visit.
willow_rosenberg So he's not here.
cordelia_chase Well, then where is he?
buffy_summers He'll go to wherever Angel is.
willow_rosenberg That means the factory, right?
cordelia_chase So Giles is gonna try to kill Angel then?
xander_harris Well, it's about time somebody did.
willow_rosenberg Xander!
xander_harris I'm sorry, but let's not forget that I hated Angel long before you guys jumped on the bandwagon. So I think I deserve a little something for not saying 'I told you so' long before now. And if Giles wants to go after the, uh, fiend that murdered his girlfriend, I say, 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!'
buffy_summers You're right.
xander_harris Thank you.
buffy_summers There's only one thing wrong with Giles' little revenge scenario.
xander_harris And what's that?
buffy_summers It's gonna get him killed.
spike Are you insane?! We're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag gifts in the friends' beds.
drusilla But, Spike, the bad teacher was going to restore Angel's soul.
spike What if she did? If you ask me, I find myself preferring the old Buffy-whipped Angelus. This new, improved one is not playing with a full sack. I love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke, but his little pranks will only leave us with one incredibly brassed-off Slayer!
angel Don't worry, roller boy. I've got everything under control.
angel Jeez, whatever happened to wooden stakes?
spike Uh-uh. No fair going into the ring unless he tags you first.
angel All right. You've had your fun. But you know what it's time for now?
buffy_summers My fun.
angel Are you gonna let your old man just burn?
rupert_giles Why did you come here?! This wasn't your fight!
buffy_summers Are you trying to get yourself killed?!
buffy_summers You can't leave me. I can't do this alone.
angel It hurts sometimes more than we can bear.
angel If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow.
angel Empty rooms, shuttered and dank...
angel Without passion, we'd be truly dead.
rupert_giles In my years as... Watcher... I've buried... too many people. But Jenny was the first I've loved.
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't kill him for you... for her... when I had the chance.
buffy_summers I wasn't ready.
buffy_summers But I think I finally am.
willow_rosenberg Hi. Principal Snyder asked me to fill in for Ms. Calendar... u-until the new computer science teacher arrives. So I'm just gonna stick to the lesson plan she left.
buffy_summers I can't hold on to the past anymore. Angel has gone. Nothing's ever gonna bring him back.
