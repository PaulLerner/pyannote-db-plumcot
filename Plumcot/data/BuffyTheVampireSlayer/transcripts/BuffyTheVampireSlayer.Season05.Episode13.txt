rupert_giles Previously on
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 ...and sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn.
glory Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie? And she won't give it back! I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
buffy_summers She doesn't know anything.
buffy_summers Okay, let's see who you are.
orlando The Knights of Byzantium, an ancient order. And now your enemy. So long as you protect the key, the brotherhood will never stop until we destroy it and you.
spike Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
RILEY_VOICEOVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Because you are.
spike Well ... yeah.
buffy_summers Just tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
quentin_travers Glory isn't a demon.
buffy_summers What is she?
quentin_travers She's a god.
buffy_summers Look, I know Mom wants to gather and make with the merry tomorrow night, but with everything that's going on...
willow_rosenberg This is exactly what you need. A 20th birthday party with, with, with presents, and funny hats, and, and those candles that don't blow out... Those used to scare me.
tara_maclay Me too.
buffy_summers I just don't think this is the best time to break out the party pinata. We need to stay focused if we're gonna find a way to stop Glory.
xander_harris We're going up against a god. An actual mightier-than-thou god.
willow_rosenberg Well, you know what they say, the bigger they are-
anya The faster they stomp you into nothing.
buffy_summers She's right. I've thrown everything I've got at her and she just shrugs it off.
willow_rosenberg Then we have to find something heavier to throw.
rupert_giles That might pose some difficulty. From what the Council's been able to discover from the book of Tarnis and, and, and other sources, Glory and two of her fellow hellgods ruled over ... one of the more seriously unpleasant demon dimensions.
tara_maclay There's more than one?
anya Oh, there are thousands of demon dimensions. All different.
rupert_giles All pushing on the edges of our reality, trying to find a way in.
buffy_summers I guess Glory found one. The question is, why?
rupert_giles There's nothing to indicate that here. Just ... vague references to ... chaos and destruction.
buffy_summers Okay, so, we know where Glory's from. What do we know about her? You know, she's tough, yeah, but, but no bolts of lightning, no blasts of fire, shouldn't a god be able to do that kind of stuff?
rupert_giles Uh, usually, yes, but um, being in human form must be severely limiting her powers. All we have to worry about right now is she's immortal, invulnerable, and insane.
xander_harris A *crazy* hellgod? And the fun just keeps on leaving.
rupert_giles From what I've been able to gather, her living in this world is ... seriously affecting her mental state as well. She's only being able to keep her mind intact by, uh, extracting energy from us. Well, from, from the human brain.
tara_maclay She, she, she's a brain-sucker?
rupert_giles She, um ... absorbs the energies that bind the human mind into a cohesive whole. Once drained, all that's left behind is, uh-
buffy_summers Crazy people.
rupert_giles Which is, I'm afraid, why there's been a marked increase in the ranks of the mentally unstable here in Sunnydale.
tara_maclay At least vampires just kill you.
buffy_summers We have to find a way to stop her.
willow_rosenberg Oh, well, Tara and I can work on some tactical spells.
anya I can do some research. I know *way* more about demon dimensions than Giles does. Well, I do.
xander_harris This is great long-term plan-y stuff, but what about this ... key thingy Glory's looking for?
tara_maclay Yeah, I mean, shouldn't we be trying to find it before she does?
buffy_summers I don't think that's what we should be worrying about right now.
willow_rosenberg They've got a point. Whatever Glory's planning on opening with the key, I'm guessing it won't be filled with candy and flowers.
xander_harris So where should we start looking? Do we know where it used to be kept? Who saw it last?
buffy_summers We did. Giles and me. We, we know where it is.
xander_harris You what?
willow_rosenberg You know, and you didn't tell us?
rupert_giles There were ... reasons.
buffy_summers Look, i-if Glory knew that you guys knew where it was, I ... I-I just didn't wanna put you in that kind of danger.
xander_harris As opposed to the other kind we're always in?
willow_rosenberg You should have said something.
buffy_summers Will, there- You're right. It's time.
rupert_giles Are you sure?
buffy_summers If they're gonna be risking their lives, they deserve to know.
xander_harris Know what?
buffy_summers There's something that you need to know ... about Dawn.
orlando The link must be severed. Such is the will of God.
KNIGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 The key is the link. The link must be severed. Such is the will of God. The key is the link. The link must be severed. Such is the will of God.
jinx You really think *he* is going to help you?
jinx I fear your faith is gravely misplaced.
orlando Shall we test your faith now?
glory Never send a minion to do a god's work.
glory Hey, nice sword. Bet it hurts.
dawn_summers You guys doin' a spell?
willow_rosenberg Dawn, hey. Y-yeah, we're doing an early warning incantation. If anything hellgodishly powerful comes within a hundred feet of the shop, then screechy siren things will, you know, screech.
tara_maclay This should give us a heads-up so we can hide ... the, um, key.
willow_rosenberg We already put one up around your house.
dawn_summers Cool, can I help?
willow_rosenberg Well, I don't think Buffy would like the, uh, black arts bumpin' auras with the littlest Summers.
dawn_summers Yeah, whatever.
tara_maclay How can she not be real?
willow_rosenberg She's real, she's just ... kinda ... new.
dawn_summers Hey. We on the case?
xander_harris Yeah. Right on top, perched, ready for action. How's my sweet fancy Dawn doing?
dawn_summers Fine. What's up with you? Did you get into the sugar again?
anya You make a very pretty little girl!
xander_harris Anya, you wanna help me with that thing?
anya Xander needs help with his thing!
rupert_giles I'm not sure our regular workout is ... challenging you any more. Perhaps we should make it harder.
buffy_summers You always think harder is better. Maybe next time I patrol I should carry a load of bricks, use a stake made of butter.
rupert_giles Very amusing.
rupert_giles I'm sure Dawn feels that way about her schoolwork sometimes.
buffy_summers That true? How was school today?
dawn_summers Um, the usual. Big square building filled with boredom and despair.
buffy_summers Just how I remember it.
buffy_summers So, what's the homework sitch?
dawn_summers We have to imagine what we'll be like ten years from now and write a letter to our future self. The teacher's clearly so out of ideas. Wanna help?
buffy_summers Maybe later. I have some stuff I have to do first.
dawn_summers Is it about that weird girl that came to the house?
buffy_summers Glory. And no it's not.
dawn_summers Like you'd tell me anyway. Dawn's too young and Dawn's too delicate.
buffy_summers Right. A young delicate pain in my butt.
dawn_summers I just think you're freakin' out 'cause you have to fight someone prettier than you. That is the case, right?
buffy_summers Glory is evil. And powerful. And in no way prettier than me.
dawn_summers I just think you're getting soft in your advanced age. She didn't look that tough to me.
glory Okay. One more time. Just between me and you. Our itsy-bitsy little secret. Where ... is ... the key?
orlando Even if I knew, I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
glory Well, you won't need a thousand, sweetie. I'll make the first one last. Long time.
glory What is it with you religious types? It's intimacy, isn't it?
glory Oh! You're just scared of letting someone in! Shh, shh, shh. It's okay. I know how difficult the first time can be. You don't have to be afraid. Just relax. You may not have the info I want ... but you still got something I need.
buffy_summers Prezzies!
willow_rosenberg See, just what you needed.
buffy_summers You are very, very wise. Now gimme, gimme, gimme!
anya This is extremely suspenseful! I want the presents.
buffy_summers Ohh ... it's beautiful. Thank you, guys.
tara_maclay Well, we thought you'd get lots of crossbows, other killy stuff.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, so we figured, less killy, more frilly.
anya Gotta look. Oh, it's just so lovely! Oh, I wish it was mine!
anya Oh, like you weren't all thinking the same thing.
rupert_giles I'm fairly certain I wasn't. I've got one just like it.
dawn_summers Here. Open mine.
buffy_summers It's not gonna explode, is it?
dawn_summers It's when we visited Dad that summer in San Diego. Um, I put the shells on it myself. We picked them off the beach.
buffy_summers I remember.
dawn_summers Well, geez, don't get all movie-of-the-week. I was just too cheap to buy a real present.
buffy_summers Thank you.
joyce_summers It still seems to me like there's a lot you don't know about this. I mean, is she dangerous?
buffy_summers No.
rupert_giles Well, now, wait just a second. I assume you're talking about her existence rather than her intentions.
joyce_summers Exactly.
buffy_summers Dawn? What are you doing in there? Party gettin' slow?
dawn_summers Uh, we need plates. Cake time.
dawn_summers Why does everybody start acting all weird when I'm around?
xander_harris Me? Me not weird.
dawn_summers I'm not an idiot. I know you're talking about me.
xander_harris No, no, we really weren't.
anya We were talking about sex.
dawn_summers They were talking about me, just like everybody is.
xander_harris Again, not so much. In fact, none.
anya We were talking about sex. I mean, you know us, sometimes we like to pretend stuff-
joyce_summers Um...
xander_harris Anya!
anya You know, like, say there's a fireman, or a shepherd-
buffy_summers You know what? Let's not have this exchange of images right now.
dawn_summers Oh. Right. Of course. Can't let Dawn hear anything. Fine. I'm just gonna go to bed. That way I won't accidentally get exposed to, like, words.
willow_rosenberg Cake?
dawn_summers Geez! Lurk much?
spike I wasn't lurking. I was standing about. It's a whole different vibe.
dawn_summers What is- Are you giving Buffy a birthday present? Oh my god. Weird. And chocolates? Lame. And the box is all bent, and, well, you know she'd never touch anything from you anyway.
spike Shouldn't you be tucked away in your beddy-bye? All warm and safe where nothing can eat you?
dawn_summers Is that supposed to scare me?
spike Little tremble wouldn't hurt.
dawn_summers Sorry, it's just ... come on. *I'm* badder than you.
spike Are not!
dawn_summers Am too. You're standing in the bushes hugging a bent box of chocolates, and I'm-
spike What? Sneaking out to braid hair and watch Teletubbies with your mates?
dawn_summers No. I'm breaking into the magic shop ... to steal things.
spike Magic shop, eh? All number of beasties between here and there. Bet they'd really go for a little red riding hood like you. Bet that wouldn't sit too well with big sister.
dawn_summers I can take care of myself.
dawn_summers You wanna come steal some stuff?
spike Yeah, all right.
dawn_summers Do you know how to do that or not?
spike Give us a sec. I usually just burst through doors.
spike That's right! Who's bad now?
spike Girl with a mission, eh? What's the caper? Jewels? Ancient artifacts? Or just plain hard cash liberated from the till?
dawn_summers A book.
spike All this for a book?
dawn_summers I don't want the book. Just what's inside. I think it was Giles' notes. He was standing here, and when I turned around it was gone.
spike Where did he learn to write so bloody small, from a fruit fly?
dawn_summers Wait, here's something. Uh, Tarnis, 12th century. One of the founders of the monks of the order of Dagon. Their sole purpose appears to have been as protectors of the key.
spike Brown-robe types are always protecting something. It's the only way they can justify giving up girls. Hey! Troll hammer.
spike Didn't go with my stuff anyway.
dawn_summers The key is not directly described in any known literature, but all research indicates an energy matrix vibrating at a dimensional frequency beyond normal human perception. Only those outside reality can see the key's true nature. Outside reality. What's that mean?
spike Mm. Second-sight blokes, mostly. Or even just your run-of-the-mill lunatics.
CRAZY_SECURITY_GUARD#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 There! There's no one in there.
CRAZY_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 I know what you are.
spike What else does it say about this key? Is it made out of gold? Maybe we can hock it, split the take.
dawn_summers Um, The key is also susceptible to necromanced animal detection, particularly those of canine or serpent construct.
spike The monks possessed the ability to transform energy, bend reality. Blah, blah, blah. Good lord, Giles writes as dull as he talks, doesn't he? They started work. But the Council ... has suggested ... to us that they were interrupted. Presumably by ... Glory. They obviously did manage to accomplish the taste... accomplish the task. They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life. So they sent the key to her ... in human form. In the form of a sister.
spike Huh! I guess that's you, nibblet.
willow_rosenberg Not even a card, huh?
buffy_summers I wasn't really expecting one. No contact with civilians. There's probably a ... code name for it. You know, like radio silence, it's greeting card silence.
willow_rosenberg Sorry.
buffy_summers Maybe it's time to start a new tradition. Birthdays without boyfriends. It could be just as much fun.
willow_rosenberg Preaching to the choir here, baby.
tara_maclay Yeah, some of my best- Oh-oh my god.
dawn_summers Is this blood?
buffy_summers Dawn!
joyce_summers Oh, baby.
buffy_summers What did you do?!
dawn_summers This is blood, isn't it? It can't be me. I'm not a key. I'm not a thing.
joyce_summers Oh, sweetie, no. Wha-what is this all about?
dawn_summers What am I? Am I real? Am I anything?
willow_rosenberg If you need anything-
buffy_summers Thanks.
rupert_giles Perhaps I should stay, you know, just in case.
buffy_summers This is a family thing. We should deal with this.
rupert_giles Okay.
dawn_summers Why didn't you tell me?
buffy_summers We were going to. It just...
joyce_summers We thought it would be better if we waited until you were older.
dawn_summers How old am I now?
joyce_summers You're fourteen, sweetheart, you know that.
dawn_summers No. The monks. When did ... when did they ...
buffy_summers Six months ago.
dawn_summers I've only been alive for six months, huh?
joyce_summers Honey, you've been alive a lot longer than that to us.
dawn_summers You don't know that! You don't know anything. I'm, I'm just a key, right? Everything about me is made up.
buffy_summers Dawn ... Mom and I know what we feel. I know I care about you. I know that I worry about you-
dawn_summers You worry about me because you have to. I'm your job. Protect the key, right?
buffy_summers I worry because my sister is cutting herself!
dawn_summers Yeah? How do you know? Maybe this is just another fake memory from my fake family.
joyce_summers Sweetheart-
dawn_summers Get out.
buffy_summers Dawn...
dawn_summers Get out, get out, get out!
buffy_summers We need answers, Giles.
buffy_summers We need to find out everything we can about the key. What's it for, who created it.
xander_harris And why Glory has a big girl-god jones for it.
buffy_summers This isn't about her. It's about Dawn. She deserves to know where she came from. She needs to know. Or it's just gonna eat away at her.
rupert_giles How did she find these? How did she get in here?
anya Ew! Who's been using the urn of Ishtar as an ashtray?
spike Morning, sunshine. If you've come around for eggs or sausage, I'm fresh out.
spike Hey, careful! These are wet.
buffy_summers How could you let her find out like that? From books and papers? You hate me that much?
spike I was just along for the ride. Not like I knew she was mystical glowy key thing. Nobody keeps me in the bloody loop, do they?
buffy_summers You could have stopped her.
spike Oh, yeah, here it comes. Something goes wrong in your life, blame Spike. News flash, blondie. If kid sis wants to grab a midnight stroll, she'll find a way sooner or later. I just thought she'd be safer with big bad looking over her shoulder.
buffy_summers She shouldn't have found out like that.
spike You didn't think you could keep the truth from her forever, did you? Maybe if *you* had been more honest with her in the first place, you wouldn't be trying to make yourself feel better with a round of Kick The Spike.
joyce_summers Honey? You're gonna be late for school.
dawn_summers I'm not going. Blobs of energy don't need an education.
joyce_summers You want me to make you some soup? I think there's some chicken and stars...
dawn_summers I'm not sick! I'm not anything.
joyce_summers Honey, calm down, okay...
dawn_summers Don't tell me what to do. You're not my mother.
dawn_summers I changed my mind. I'd rather be at school.
ben All right, fellas, today we've got blues, greens, and... oh, hey, chartreuse. It's a party.
orlando It won't stick. The birds have been pecking too hard.
ben Byzantium.
jinx Yes, they've arrived. Unfortunate, but not completely unexpected.
ben How many?
jinx Their numbers are few for the moment, but they will grow. The Knights of Byzantium are like ants. First you see one, then two, then the picnic's ruined. No matter how many we kill, they'll keep coming ... wave after wave. It's time to set old animosities aside. Your fate is directly linked to her magnificently-scented Glorificus. She's been extremely forgiving of your considerable foibles up until now, but if you persist in your defiance, she'll be forced to-
ben To what? What is she going to do? Send a six-pack of minions to bore me to death? Glory can't lay a finger on me. You know it, I know it, she knows it. So save the threats, or I'll finish the job I started on your head.
joyce_summers We can't just let her sit up there all alone.
buffy_summers She needs time. We can't force her to be all right with this.
joyce_summers That's your answer? Just ... leave her alone and hope that everything works itself out?
buffy_summers No, but if I were her, I'd want a little bit of time right now. I wouldn't want my mother and my sister coming at me from all sides.
joyce_summers Her school called today. She was suspended.
joyce_summers She yelled at a teacher. The things she said, Buffy, I mean she never used language like that
buffy_summers She probably feels like she can say or do anything right now. She's not real. We're not her family, we don't even know what she is.
joyce_summers How can you talk about Dawn as if she's a thing?
buffy_summers I'm not! I'm just ... saying that's probably how she feels.
joyce_summers Well, then we have to show her that it isn't true. She needs to know that she's still a part of this family and that we love her.
buffy_summers It's not that simple! We're not gonna be able to fix this with a hug and a kiss and a bowl of soup! Dawn needs to know where she came from, she needs real answers.
joyce_summers What she needs is her sister, Buffy, not the Slayer.
buffy_summers The Slayer is the only thing standing between Dawn ... and this god from the bitch dimension that wants to shove her in some kind of lock and give her a good twirl. Mom, I need to be out there, doing my job-
buffy_summers Oh my god, Glory. It's Willow's spell.
joyce_summers Wait. It's not Glory.
buffy_summers Damn it.
buffy_summers Dawn!
joyce_summers Buffy.
buffy_summers No. No, she could have burned the house down.
joyce_summers Buffy ... she's gone.
buffy_summers She tore up her room ... she burned all of her diaries.
xander_harris The
willow_rosenberg She's been keeping those since ... I mean...
buffy_summers Since she was seven. I remember too, Will. We have to find her. Fast. Before Glory or the knights of hack-n-slash figure out what - *who* she really is. Mom's gonna stay at home in case she shows up. I figure we split up and sweep the city. Anya. Will you stay here in case she shows up? Xander, Giles, you guys take the center of town. Willow, Tara, west side. Spike, you and I'll get the east side.
buffy_summers Just find her ... please.
young_buffy Bet you can't push me all the way around!
young_buffy Oh yes I can!
young_buffy No you can't!
xander_harris There's so many things I remember. Seeing Dawn ... hanging with her ... listening to Buffy complain about her. Mostly that last one. How could it be that all those things never really happened?
rupert_giles Well, it takes some getting used to. The idea of a ... bright fourteen-year-old actually being living energy thousands of years old.
xander_harris I'm guessing some kind of super-powerful in her raw form.
rupert_giles People have killed, died for it ... summoned armies to control the key.
xander_harris You know, uh ... she kinda has a crush on me.
rupert_giles Your point being?
xander_harris Well nothing, no, uh ... just saying, powerful being ... big energy gal digging the Xan-man. Some guys are just cooler, you know?
buffy_summers Dawn! Dawn!
spike Yeah, that should do it.
buffy_summers Shut up.
spike The nibblet scampered off to get away from you. She hears you bellowing, she's gonna pack it in the opposite direction. Can't say I blame her.
buffy_summers You were right. This is my fault. I should have told her.
spike Look, she probably would have skipped off anyway, even if she never found out. She's not just a blob of energy, she's also a fourteen-year-old hormone bomb. Which one's screwing her up more right now, spin the bloody wheel. You'll find her, just in the nick of time, that's what you hero types do.
spike You'll find her.
buffy_summers And then what?
PATIENT_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 It's here. It's here. It's here.
PATIENT_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Can't stop.
PATIENT_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 It's here. It's here.
PATIENT_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Make it stop. The skin's too tight.
PATIENT_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Can't hear it. What's the frequency? Empty. All spilled out.
dawn_summers Please. Y-you see me, right? Look at me.
PATIENT_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Can't stop it!
dawn_summers You know what I am, don't you? You all know!
PATIENT_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Can't hear it, can't hear it, can't hear it
dawn_summers Tell me!
PATIENT_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Can't hear it, can't hear it ...
dawn_summers What am I?
orlando The key.
orlando I found it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
dawn_summers You know what the key is? Where did I come from? Who made me, wha-what am I?
orlando Thank you, thank you...
dawn_summers Please!
orlando Destroyer! Cracked ... bones ... the sun bleeding into the sky! The key is the link.
dawn_summers No, no.
orlando The link must be severed. Such is the will of God. Such is the will of God. Such is the will of God.
orlando Such is the will of God.
PATIENT_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 Can't hear it.
ben Two steaming cups of chocolate goodness courtesy of ... whoever I swiped it from out of the cupboard. Couldn't find any marshmallows. I'll try to steal some for next time.
dawn_summers Don't like 'em anyway.
ben What? Is that even possible?
dawn_summers Too squishy. When I was five, Buffy told me they were monkey brains, and I-
ben Dawn, was your mom brought back in? Is that why you're here?
dawn_summers No. My *mom*'s just fine.
ben Is there anybody I can call? Your sister?
dawn_summers I don't have a sister.
ben Oh ... you two have a fight? It's okay, I know how that goes. I got a sister too. They can be a real pain sometimes. I tell you, there've been a lot of nights I wish she didn't exist either.
dawn_summers It's not Buffy. It's me. I'm the one that doesn't exist.
ben Look, I know it can feel that way sometimes, but when you're older-
dawn_summers No, you don't understand. It's not real. None of this. They made it.
ben Dawn-
dawn_summers I'm nothing! I'm just a thing the monks made so Glory couldn't find me. I'm not real.
ben You're the key?
dawn_summers How do you know about the key?
ben Go! Before she finds you. Don't ask me how she knows, 'cause she always knows. Just go.
dawn_summers Wait! Calm down, just tell me-
ben You don't understand, you're a kid. You stay, she'll find you. She finds you, she'll hurt you.
dawn_summers What's wrong with you?
ben You're what she's been searching for. I am telling you, run. You don't know, you - Oh god. Oh god no, she's coming. I can feel it, you've gotta get out. No ... oh no, she's here!
ben She's here!
glory Hey, don't I know you?
glory Ugh, cotton!
glory Could a fabric be more annoyingly pedestrian? Now *this* is what I'm talkin' about. Makes your skin sing.
dawn_summers You're-you're Ben...
glory Uh, it's an eensy more complicated than that. Family always is, isn't it?
glory You'd never make it. I'd rip out your spine before you got half a step. And those little legs? They wouldn't be much good without one of those.
glory Would they, Dawnie?
glory Now. What I'm trying to noodle, is what in the world was the Slayer's little sis doing here with gentle Ben?
dawn_summers Y-you don't remember?
glory Remember what? You were talking to him, not me. Oh, he wasn't being naughty, was he?
burly_guard Excuse me, ma'am. This area's for hospital personnel-
glory Rude! I was talking! What do you say ... we find a nice place off the beaten where you and I can have a long uninterrupted chat.
willow_rosenberg We looked, but no Dawn.
buffy_summers What about the carousel?
tara_maclay Checked there too.
buffy_summers Nothing?
xander_harris Sorry, Buff.
buffy_summers Anything could have happened to her. Not just Glory.
buffy_summers We better check the hospital.
glory Okay. Small talk over. I'm in a bit of a crunch here, so let's cut right to the ooey gooey center. Your sister, the Slayer, has my key. It's mine, I want it. Do you know where she squirreled it away? There's ice cream and puppydogs in it for you if you start singin'.
dawn_summers I'm not sure. What does it look like?
glory Well... the last time I caught a peep ... it was a bright green swirly shimmer. Really brought out the blue in my eyes. But then those sneaky little monks pulled an abracadabra, so now it could look like anything. You see the predicament I'm in.
dawn_summers Maybe...
glory Yes?
dawn_summers Well, maybe if you ... told me more about it, I'd know if I've seen it.
glory Okay.
buffy_summers She wasn't brought in.
xander_harris Which is a happy thing, right?
buffy_summers I don't know, I...
DOCTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13 ...found him on the floor in the break room. You guys gotta see him. His head's almost twisted clean off.
buffy_summers Glory.
dawn_summers So this ... key thing ... it's been around for a long time?
glory Well, not as long as me, but ... yeah. Just this side of forever.
dawn_summers Is it evil?
glory Totally!
glory Well, no, not really. I guess it depends on your point of view.
dawn_summers What's it for? I mean ... if it's a key, there's gotta be a lock, right?
glory Yes. We have a winner.
dawn_summers S-so what does it open?
glory I smell a fox in my hen house. Is that why you've been playing sugar and spice with old Uncle Ben? Trying to get a peek at Glory's unmentionables?
dawn_summers No, I-
glory Shh! I kinda wanna hear me talking right now. Me talking. You know what I'm starting to think? I'm thinking ... that maybe you ... don't have any idea where my key is.
glory Very irritating. Irrational. Know what I mean, tiny snapdragon? Like...
glory ...bugs under my skin. And say, I'm feelin' a little...
dawn_summers What's wrong with you?
glory Hey. Hey! This doesn't have to be a complete waste of my precious time. I've been meaning to send the Slayer a message. And I could use a little pick-me-up. Two birds, one stone, and Boom. You have yummy dead birds.
buffy_summers Get away from my sister.
glory Hey, we were just talking about you.
buffy_summers Conversation's over, hell-bitch.
spike I thought you said this skank was tough.
glory He wakes up, tell your boyfriend to watch his mouth.
buffy_summers He is NOT my boyfriend.
glory Hey, those are really nice shoes.
buffy_summers Giles, now!
glory Oh, please. Like that's-
glory Hey! Watch the hair.
glory Time to start the dyin'. Start with the whelp!
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers Get back!
glory Nice catch. Is that the best you little crap-gnats can muster? 'Cause I gotta tell ya, so not impressed.
glory Look what you did to my dress, you little-
!_#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode13
tara_maclay Willow!
buffy_summers Dawn.
buffy_summers What did you do to her?
willow_rosenberg Teleportation spell. Still working out the kinks.
buffy_summers Where'd you send her?
willow_rosenberg Don't know. That's one of the kinks.
glory Oh, sh-
rupert_giles That was an incredibly ... dangerous spell for an adept at your level.
willow_rosenberg Yep. Won't be trying that one again soon.
buffy_summers Are you okay? Did she hurt you?
dawn_summers Why do you care?
buffy_summers Because I love you. You're my sister.
dawn_summers No I'm not.
buffy_summers Yes you are. Look, it's blood. It's Summers blood.
buffy_summers It's just like mine. It doesn't matter where you came from, or, or how you got here. You are my sister. There's no way you could annoy me so much if you weren't.
dawn_summers I was so scared.
buffy_summers Me too.
buffy_summers Come on.
dawn_summers Wait. Ben. He was here, he was trying to help me. He... I ... I think he might have left before Glory came ... I can't, I can't remember.
buffy_summers It's okay. Don't worry about it. Next time we see him, we'll thank him. I have to get you back home though. Mom's freaking out.
dawn_summers Oh. Is she mad about the whole fire thing?
buffy_summers I think you sorta have a get-out-of-jail-free card on account of big love and trauma.
dawn_summers Really? Okay. Good.
dawn_summers You think she'd raise my allowance?
buffy_summers Don't push it.
