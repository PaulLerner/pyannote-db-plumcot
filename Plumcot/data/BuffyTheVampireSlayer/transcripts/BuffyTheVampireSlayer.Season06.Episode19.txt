willow_rosenberg When did morning happen?
tara_maclay After the moon went down.
willow_rosenberg Mmm, I forgot how good this could feel. Us. Together. Without the magic.
tara_maclay There was plenty of magic.
willow_rosenberg It's getting late.
tara_maclay Wanna get up?
willow_rosenberg No! Oh god, no. I was just thinking about Buffy.
tara_maclay Oh. She still isn't back?
willow_rosenberg I didn't hear her. She wouldn't talk about what happened at the magic shop when she got home last night. She just wanted to know how close I was to tracing the camera signal back to the Empire of the Nerds. And then she left again.
tara_maclay I'm sure she'll be okay.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I'm not really worried about her going up against Warren and the others. I know this is going to sound crazy, but ... I think something might be going on. With Spike and Buffy. I mean, she looked so hurt when she saw him with Anya. I think maybe-
tara_maclay They've been sleeping together.
willow_rosenberg No. I wouldn't go that far.
tara_maclay No, I mean she told me they've been sleeping together.
willow_rosenberg Sleeping together? You mean like the naked kind of together?
tara_maclay I'm sorry I didn't say anything, but I, I promised her I wouldn't.
willow_rosenberg Does everybody else know? Am I the only one she didn't-
tara_maclay God, no. She, she didn't even mean to tell me, it just came out.
willow_rosenberg How could she hide something like this from me?
tara_maclay I think she was afraid of the look you'd get on your face. Kinda like the one you're wearing now.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no, I'm not ... I'm just trying to understand.
tara_maclay So is she.
willow_rosenberg Wow, she probably really needs someone to talk to.
tara_maclay Probably.
tara_maclay We've been kinda busy, maybe we didn't hear her come home.
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
dawn_summers She back yet?
willow_rosenberg Uh, not yet. I'm sure she'll be home soon. Everything's fine, just go back to bed.
dawn_summers It's ten o'clock.
willow_rosenberg Oh. Uh...
dawn_summers You don't think she's ... gonna hurt Spike, do you?
willow_rosenberg She told you about Spike?
dawn_summers It was kinda obvious after last night.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I totally knew.
dawn_summers It must have hurt so much. To see him and, and, and Anya like that? And poor Xander. Everything is so screwed up.
willow_rosenberg It's gonna be all right. It's just ... complicated. You know, when, when people have such strong feelings for each other, sometimes-
tara_maclay Is she back yet?
tara_maclay Oh. Hey.
D#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Oh! You and-
tara_maclay Uh, that's my cue to put some clothes on.
dawn_summers No! No no no! I'm totally not here! You guys, you do whatever you want. Um ... I'll go watch TV. Downstairs, really loud! In the basement. Where I can't hear anything. Oh my god!
dawn_summers I love you guys!
buffy_summers All right. Let's make this quick.
buffy_summers Fine. But I'm not leaving till we have a little chat.
buffy_summers Very little, considering the pummeling that needs to occur.
buffy_summers I mean, guys, helloooo. Slayer here. Did you honestly think I wouldn't find you...
buffy_summers Well, that can't be good.
buffy_summers Okay. That's gonna cost ya.
willow_rosenberg Okay, we're here, ready for action! Uh, bad guy fighting action.
buffy_summers Guys, you didn't have to ... You know, if you still wanna be alone-
willow_rosenberg No. No, we're good.
tara_maclay We're better than good.
buffy_summers Great.
willow_rosenberg Super.
buffy_summers Awww.
willow_rosenberg Okay, all right, we'll stop.
dawn_summers Oh, you better not!
tara_maclay So, um, nerds. How are them? They?
buffy_summers Well, I found their lair, but they obviously knew we were tracing their signal. They left in a hurry. Van was gone, but everything else was still there.
willow_rosenberg We should go back, uh, Tara and I can Sherlock around-
buffy_summers There's nothing left there now. Giant buzz saw. It was a thing. This was all that I could save. I, I know it's not much, but we need to go through it and see if we can find anything that might tell us what, what they're doing, where they're going....
tara_maclay Um, this might take a while.
buffy_summers Anything we can do to fast forward? We really need to find Warren and the others before anyone else gets hurt.
willow_rosenberg Should we call Xander?
buffy_summers I don't think he's really in the Scooby space. We need to give him some time.
dawn_summers Maybe they've heard something in the demon bars about those guys. Spike-
buffy_summers Spike .... Spike's not part of the team.
dawn_summers So he's not ... going to be around anymore?
buffy_summers Uh ... I don't know, Dawn. Not, not for a while.
tara_maclay What about Anya? She might be able to help with some of the demon texts.
buffy_summers I'm guessing she's not feeling real researchy right now.
anya I know how you feel. Maybe I can help.
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 How could Carl do that to me? That bastard!
anya He's a man. Look no further.
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 But with my sister? She's not even pretty.
anya Well ... it isn't always about looks. Or a beating heart. Sometimes intimate sweaty relations with the wrong person just seems like a good idea at the time.
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 She's fat! He cheated on me with my fat ugly sister!
anya Likes 'em fleshy, huh? Bet you wish he'd bloat up a coupla thousand pounds and pop like a big ol' meat zeppelin, don't you?
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 He said he loved me.
anya Oh, gee, then he must have meant it, 'cause hey, guys never say anything they don't really mean, do they?
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 But we-
anya They say, I love you, and, and you think it's true. They say, Oh, Anya, I want to be with you for the rest of my life, and, and you believe them, you believe they feel the same way about you, because that's the way love's supposed to be, right?
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Who's Anya?
anya And then you get all excited with the tingly anticipation, but wait! Not so fast! There's the apocalypse, a-and the back from the grave, and the blah blah blah blah blah, and by the time you're finally standing there in that beautiful expensive white dress you've dreamed about ever since you became human, he's gets all heebie-jeebie and decides, you know, I'd rather just go steady.
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Men suck. I wish Carl's flesh would-
anya And you know, he said it isn't me, but how can I believe him? I mean ... he knew he didn't want to get married! Deep down he knew, but he lied to me every day for months!
CRYING_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 I wish-
anya He lied and lied and then lied some more, 'cause hey , who's gonna notice with all the other lies flying around like little monkeys? And then he thinks he can just sweep the carnage underneath the rug by saying , oh-
VOICE#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 I'm sorry. Sorry.
andrew_wells Sorry, please! I'll never try to desecrate your chamber again!
andrew_wells Just don't hurt me! Please!
jonathan_levinson Hit him again! Hit him again!
warren_meers Wow. These things are tougher than I thought. You know, one jolt from this should have dropped an elephant .
andrew_wells You want a piece of this? Huh? Not so tough, are you now, Puff 'N Stuff?!
warren_meers Hey, hey! We need him fresh, all right, not smoke house.
andrew_wells I'm done being the bait. Next time one of you can wiggle on the hook.
warren_meers If this works ... then next time we'll be the thing that everyone's afraid of.
jonathan_levinson Okay, so ... what now?
warren_meers Well, now it's your turn, Sparky.
dawn_summers Does it help?
spike Doesn't hurt.
spike Not planning a camp-out, are we?
dawn_summers No. I'm sleeping over at Janice's. Figured Willow and Tara might want some time to, uh...
spike Oh, so the birds are flying again, eh? Ain't love grand.
dawn_summers I wanted to stop by on my way and, you know. Everybody's pretty mad at you.
spike Yeah. Kinda picked up on that.
dawn_summers You're not going to be coming aroundanymore. Are you?
spike It's complicated, Nibblet.
dawn_summers Everybody's been saying that.
spike Must be true then.
dawn_summers Was it worth it? What you did with Anya?
spike Buffy told you?
dawn_summers Kinda caught the show. There was a camera somewhere in the Magic Box. Warren and Jonathan and that other guy have been watching Buffy.
spike Wankers!
dawn_summers Do you love her?
spike Oh, no. No. It was just a ... It was a bad day. For both of us. And we just had a few drinks and, things just-
dawn_summers No. Not Anya. Buffy.
dawn_summers Do you really love her?
dawn_summers Then how could you do that to her?
spike Oh, right , 'cause Big Sis was treating me so well up until that point. Must still be a bit of the evil left in me after all.
dawn_summers I don't know what happened betweenyou two. But what you did last night ... If you wanted to hurt Buffy, congratulations. It worked.
warren_meers This is it. We found it.
andrew_wells You sure it's in there?
warren_meers Careful! Only Nezzla demons can pass through the barrier.
warren_meers Everything else gets curly-fried.
jonathan_levinson This sucks.
warren_meers Just make sure all your skin's covered.
jonathan_levinson Why can't I just use a glamor?
andrew_wells You can't Siegfried and Roy the barrier. It's gotta be the real deal.
jonathan_levinson Ahh! It's still wet.
warren_meers Good. Then it should still be fresh enough.
jonathan_levinson Should be? Wait a minute, what do you mean, what do you mean, should be?
warren_meers Huh. Wasn't sure that would work.
jonathan_levinson Jackass.
andrew_wells You think he knows?
warren_meers Well, if he did, why would he be here?
andrew_wells Why is he? Our mojo's tight, bro. We could've pulled this ourselves.
warren_meers Well, somebody had to guinea pig the meat suit. Were, were you gonna volunteer?
andrew_wells No. I don't trust the leprechaun.
warren_meers Okay, just stay frosty. This works the way we planned it, by the end of the evening Jonathan won't be a problem.
warren_meers You got it?
jonathan_levinson Yeah, I got it.
andrew_wells That's it?
jonathan_levinson It better be.
jonathan_levinson No way I'm going back through there. Thing stings like a mother.
andrew_wells Dude, unholy hair gel.
jonathan_levinson Get off.
andrew_wells Make me, skin job.
warren_meers Shut up.
warren_meers Ohh.
warren_meers Gentlemen...
warren_meers ...the Orbs of Nezzla'khan. Strength. Invulnerability. The deluxe package.
andrew_wells They're everything I've ever dreamed of.
jonathan_levinson You know, those things have been down here for like a zillion years. How do we know they still work?
warren_meers Ohh, they work.
andrew_wells You don't look any different. I thought they were supposed to make us all huge and veiny. Are you sure they're working right?
warren_meers Let's find out.
jonathan_levinson Mahatma!
warren_meers Welcome to the show, boys.
andrew_wells That was so hot!
jonathan_levinson Lemme try 'em!
warren_meers Watch the paws, little man.
jonathan_levinson Ow. We're supposed to share.
warren_meers Oh, relax. All right, you'll each get a whirl. As soon as I'm done playing with 'em.
buffy_summers Hey.
xander_harris Hey.
xander_harris I think there's still a cold one in the fridge.
buffy_summers Thanks, but, uh, I think it's still a little early for me.
buffy_summers She loves you. You know that. Anya was just ... She was hurting. She was ... hurting and, and she did this really stupid thing.
xander_harris With your boyfriend.
buffy_summers He's not my boyfriend.
xander_harris I know why Anya ... I understand, I do. But you...
xander_harris All those times I told Spike to get lost ... that he didn't have a chance with a girl like you.
buffy_summers You don't know how hard it's been.
xander_harris What, lying to me?
buffy_summers Being here. After I was brought back.
buffy_summers You have no idea how hard it is just being here.
xander_harris You could have told me.
buffy_summers You didn't want to know.
xander_harris So you went to him instead?
buffy_summers Xander, what I do with my personal life is none of your business.
xander_harris It used to be.
buffy_summers It just happened, okay?
xander_harris Oh, like, uh, Say, you're evil. Get on me?
buffy_summers You fought side by side with him when I was gone. You let him take care of Dawn.
xander_harris But I never forgot what he really is. God, what were you thinking?
buffy_summers You're asking me that? Oh, 'cause your decision making skills have really sparkled lately.
xander_harris I'm not saying I didn't make any mistakes. But last time I checked, slaughtering half of Europe wasn't one of them. He doesn't have a soul, Buffy. Just some leash they jammed in his head. You think he'd still be all snuggles if that chip ever stopped working? Would you still trust him with Dawn then?
buffy_summers It doesn't matter. I'm not seeing him anymore. It's over.
xander_harris Yeah. There's a lot of that going around.
Fade_to#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Sunnydale street, night. People walking around. Sad music. Xander walks down the street looking sad.
Fade_to#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Magic shop, night. Anya wanders around dusting things at random.
willow_rosenberg It's all a mess.
tara_maclay These things take time. We'll figure it out.
willow_rosenberg Sure. We'll decipher codes, foil evil schemes...
tara_maclay Finally get out of bed...
willow_rosenberg I was with you up until there. Whoa.
tara_maclay What is it?
willow_rosenberg Uh, one of their data CDs. It's filled with encrypted blueprints, schematics...
tara_maclay To what?
willow_rosenberg I'm not sure. The designations have been stripped.
tara_maclay Maybe we can cross-reference them with the county clerk's office.
willow_rosenberg Would that involve getting up?
tara_maclay Eventually.
willow_rosenberg Then I'm coming out firmly against it.
tara_maclay What about the Trio's evil scheme?
willow_rosenberg Well, I'm kinda busy working on my own.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 You're all wet.
xander_harris It's a good thing I'm part fish.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Which part?
xander_harris The part with the hook in it.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Careful. Someone might reel you in.
xander_harris Yeah, but then there'd be the flopping and the ... gasping, and ... sure, maybe it'd work out, but chances are I'd up and leave you at the helm in your white dress. Then find you spawning with another fish who turns out to be spawning my very good friend night and day behind my back. Then comes the fighting and again with the flopping and the gasping, 'cause hey , Chicken of the Sea here's not doing too good with the women these days.
WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Huh?
xander_harris Sorry, I'm just looking to curl up with the quiet alone tonight.
jonathan_levinson We don't have time for this.
andrew_wells Ease up, twitchy.
warren_meers All right.
warren_meers Let's make some noise.
buffy_summers Not bad. How hard you gonna hit when you're blowin' in the wind?
buffy_summers That was rhetorical.
buffy_summers Ow.
spike You hurt? You're not moving so well.
buffy_summers Get out.
spike We have to talk.
buffy_summers I really don't.
spike Well, this isn't just about you... as much you'd like it to be.
buffy_summers You spoke. I listened. Now leave.
spike I'm sorry. Not that it matters any more, but I needed you to know that.
buffy_summers Why?
spike Because I care about you.
buffy_summers Then you might want to try the not sleeping with my friends.
spike I didn't go to Anya for that. I was looking for a spell.
buffy_summers You were going to use a spell on me?
spike It wasn't for you! I wanted something . Anything to make these feelings stop. I just wanted it to stop!
spike You should have let him kill me.
buffy_summers I couldn't do that.
spike Why?
buffy_summers You know why.
spike Because you love me.
buffy_summers No. I don't.
spike Why do you keep lying to yourself?
buffy_summers How many times-
buffy_summers I have feelings for you. I do. But it's not love. I could never trust you enough for it to be love.
spike Trust is for old marrieds, Buffy. Great love is wild ... and passionate and dangerous. It burns and consumes.
buffy_summers Until there's nothing left. Love like that doesn't last.
spike I know you feel like I do. You don't have to hide it anymore.
buffy_summers Spike, please stop this.
spike Let yourself feel it.
buffy_summers No....
spike You love me.
buffy_summers Ow, no, stop it.
buffy_summers Spike, no - ow - what are you do-
buffy_summers Ow!
spike Let it go. Let yourself love me.
buffy_summers No, stop it!
spike I know you felt it ... when I was inside you...
buffy_summers No, ow, ow! Please, please, Spike, please...
spike You'll feel it again, Buffy...
buffy_summers Please don't do this...
spike I'm gonna make you feel it.
buffy_summers Stop!!!
spike Buffy, my god, I didn't-
buffy_summers Because I stopped you. Something I should have done a long time ago.
jonathan_levinson What are we doing here? Somebody might recognize us. Oh, oh, that's just great.
andrew_wells Warren's the boss. He's Picard, you're Deanna Troi. Get used to the feeling, Betazoid.
warren_meers ...the clothes, the cars, and the money ... see, it's all just window dressing.
warren_meers Baby, this is what's really important. Two souls, coming together ...
frank Hey!
frank She only comes together with me. So get lost, shrimp.
warren_meers Frankie? Oh my god, is that you? How long has it been?
frank That was you?
warren_meers Yeah, that was me! But hey, no hard feelings. I mean, I know you were just fooling around. Like I'm gonna be with your girl in about five minutes.
frank What'd you say?
warren_meers You heard me, meathead. Take a walk.
frank Oh, you're dead, you little-
warren_meers This ain't high school.
GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Frankie!
warren_meers Oh, don't worry about the tab, now, ladies. It's on daddy tonight.
warren_meers Don't worry, babies. Daddy's gonna give you some too.
xander_harris See now, I think it's the daddy thing that's throwing her. 'Cause incest , not that sexy.
jonathan_levinson Aw, crap.
xander_harris So, uh, why don't we leave the ladies to their impending nausea and move the freakshow outside, whaddaya say?
warren_meers Okay. But lemme ask you something first. You think maybe you could put in a word for me with that Anya chick? 'Cause if she's taking it from a vamp ... I think I might have a chance .
warren_meers No wonder she's screwing a dead guy. You hit like a girl.
xander_harris Well, at least I know how to get one.
warren_meers Let's see how popular you are without a face.
jonathan_levinson Warren, we have to go.
warren_meers We go when I'm ready.
jonathan_levinson Hey, it's your call, but ... we're gonna miss that thing you wanted to do tonight if we don't leave right now. That's all I'm saying.
warren_meers It's your lucky night, Shemp.
andrew_wells We're just gonna leave him there? What if he sics the Slayer on us?
warren_meers Bring her on.
xander_harris Buffy? I found Warren.
xander_harris This what you call not seeing Spike anymore-
xander_harris What did he do?
xander_harris Did he hurt you?
buffy_summers He tried. He didn't...
xander_harris Son of a bitch.
buffy_summers Don't.
buffy_summers Please, just ... don't.
willow_rosenberg Hey, I think we finally have something-
willow_rosenberg What happened?
buffy_summers Nothing.
buffy_summers What'd you find out?
willow_rosenberg We were able to decipher pretty much everything except these.
tara_maclay It isn't written in any ancient language we could identify.
xander_harris It's Klingon. They're love poems. Which has nothing to do with the insidious scheme you're about to describe.
buffy_summers What do you got for me that doesn't rhyme?
tara_maclay Um, this.
willow_rosenberg It was filled with encoded blueprints and schematics.
buffy_summers To what?
tara_maclay Um, banks, armored car routes, corporate vaults ... This is big.
willow_rosenberg They're looking to score some serious dinero. We don't think they're planning just one job.
xander_harris Spree, anyone?
buffy_summers I, I can't cover all of these at once.
willow_rosenberg You don't have to. We think there's one they may hit tonight.
tara_maclay It's time sensitive.
xander_harris Be careful. Warren's gone all Mighty Mouse. Emphasis on the might.
buffy_summers Good. Then I won't have to hold back.
spike I'm gonna make you feel it.
clem Uh ... knock knock?
clem I was just in the neighborhood so I thought, you know...
clem ...there's a Nightrider marathon on the TV, so, uh... I got hot wings!
spike What have I done?
spike Why *didn't* I do it? What has she done to me?
clem She done who? Ohh. The Slayer, huh? Gosh. She break up with you again?
spike We were never together. Not really. She'd never lower herself that far.
clem She's a sweet girl, Spike, but hey. Whew. Issues. And no wonder, with the whole coming back from the grave and whatnot. Hey, I had this cousin, who got resurrected by some kooky shaman... Whoo-boy! Was that a mess.
spike Why do I feel this way?
clem Love's a funny thing.
spike Is that what this is? I can feel it. Squirming in my head.
clem Love?
spike The chip. Gnawing bits and chunks.
clem Uhh ... maybe a wet cloth?
spike You know, everything used to be so clear. Slayer. Vampire. Vampire kills Slayer, sucks her dry, picks his teeth with her bones. It's always been that way. I've tasted the life of two Slayers. But with Buffy... It isn't supposed to be this way!
spike It's the chip! Steel and wires and silicon. It won't let me be a monster. And I can't be a man. I'm nothing.
clem Hey. Come on now, Mr. Negative. You never know what's just around the corner. Things change.
spike Yeah, they do.
spike If you make them.
guard_1 All right, that's the last one.
SUIT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Always the biggest gate of the year.
guard_1 Yeah.
SUIT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode19 Don't lose any.
guard_1 Yeah.
guard_2 Wanna grab a bite after? I think Ruby's is still open.
guard_2 What the hell?
guard_1 There's something back there!
andrew_wells Man, I can't wait to get my hands on his orbs.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, I'm sure he'll be giving 'em up any second now.
buffy_summers Hey.
buffy_summers Is this your bank?
buffy_summers 'Cause if not, there's gonna be a fee for that.
warren_meers I was wondering when Super Bitch would show up.
buffy_summers You really got a problem with strong women, don't you?
warren_meers Nothing I can't handle.
buffy_summers It's getting better.
warren_meers That all you got?
andrew_wells No!
buffy_summers There's two ways this can end. And right now? I'm thinking they're both gonna hurt.
andrew_wells I think you're right.
warren_meers What's the matter baby? You never fight a real man before?
warren_meers Wow. That almost hurt, kitten.
andrew_wells Kill her! Kill her!
warren_meers You know who I am? Huh, Slayer?
buffy_summers You're a murderer.
warren_meers Well, that too, but more to the point-
warren_meers And it's not the muscles, baby.
warren_meers It's the brains.
buffy_summers I'll remember that when I knock 'em clean out of your-
warren_meers Whoa! Sparky, I didn't think you had it in you.
jonathan_levinson The orbs! Smash his orbs.
warren_meers Say good night, bitch.
buffy_summers Good night, bitch.
buffy_summers You're nothing but a sad little boy, Warren. But it's time you grow up, and pay for what you've done.
warren_meers Get away from me!
buffy_summers Oh, come *on.*
andrew_wells Well played, Slayer!
jonathan_levinson Why didn't I get one of those?!
andrew_wells This round to you. But the game is far from over.
jonathan_levinson Jet packs. You jerks were setting me up to take the fall.
andrew_wells He left me. He flew away and left me.
jonathan_levinson Oh god. The Big House.
andrew_wells How could he do this to me? He promised we'd be together, but ... he was just using me. He never really loved- ...hanging out with us.
andrew_wells You think he'll come back for us? I mean ... he wouldn't just take off, would he?
spike Get nice and comfy, Slayer. I'll be back. And when I do ... things are gonna change.
willow_rosenberg Hey. Clothes.
tara_maclay Better not get used to 'em.
willow_rosenberg Hmm, yes ma'am.
tara_maclay Mmmm... Xander!
willow_rosenberg Okay, not quite the response I was fishing for.
tara_maclay No, he's here.
willow_rosenberg Think they're making up?
tara_maclay I hope so, that's the best part.
xander_harris Time for the Spring Poking already?
buffy_summers Just making sure there are no more Evil Trio cameras. Or Evil Uno.
xander_harris The sinister yet addictive card game?
buffy_summers Warren. Jonathan and Andrew got clinked, but ... Warren pulled a Rocket Man.
xander_harris You'll find him. He won't be much good without his friends.
buffy_summers No, he won't.
xander_harris How did we get here?
buffy_summers Scenic route. Long drive.
xander_harris The past few weeks...
buffy_summers I know.
xander_harris I thought I hit bottom, but ... it hurt. That you didn't trust me enough to tell me about Spike. It hurt.
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I should have told you.
xander_harris Maybe you would have, if I hadn't given you so many reasons to think I'd be an ass about it.
buffy_summers Guess we've all done a lot of things lately we're not proud of.
xander_harris I think I've got you beat.
buffy_summers Wanna compare?
xander_harris Not so much.
buffy_summers Let's not find out.
xander_harris Buffy!
warren_meers You think you can just do that to me? You think I'd let you get away with that? Think again.
tara_maclay Your shirt.
willow_rosenberg Tara?
xander_harris Sweet fancy Moses! Where the hell did he-
xander_harris Oh god!
willow_rosenberg Tara?! Baby?
willow_rosenberg Baby, come on! Get up!
xander_harris Oh god. Buffy? Buffy! Buffy!
willow_rosenberg No... no....
