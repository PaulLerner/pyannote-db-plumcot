rupert_giles This is madness! What can you have been thinking? You are the Slayer! Lives depend upon you! I make allowances for your youth, but I expect a certain amount of responsibility, and instead of which you enslave yourself to this, this... Cult?
buffy_summers You don't like the color?
rupert_giles I d... Do you, um... Do you ignore everything I say as a, as a rule?
buffy_summers No, I believe that's your trick.
buffy_summers I told you, I'm trying out for the cheerleading squad!
rupert_giles You have a sacred birthright, Buffy. You were chosen to destroy vampires, not to... wave pompoms at people. And as the Watcher I forbid it.
buffy_summers And you'll be stopping me how?
rupert_giles Well, I... By appealing to your common sense, if such a creature exists.
buffy_summers I will still have time to fight the forces of evil, okay? I just wanna have a life, I wanna do something normal. Something safe.
willow_rosenberg Giles didn't approve, huh?
buffy_summers He totally lost his water. We haven't seen a vampire in over a week. I'd say he should get a girlfriend if he wasn't so old.
willow_rosenberg Well, we're behind you.
xander_harris People scoff at things like school spirit, but look at these girls giving their all like this!
xander_harris Ooo, stretchy! Where was I?
willow_rosenberg You were pretending that seeing scantily clad girls in revealing postures was a spiritual experience.
xander_harris Who said I was pretending? Oh, hey! Here's a good luck thing for tryouts.
buffy_summers What's this?
willow_rosenberg What's that?
buffy_summers Oh, how sweet! 'Yours Always.'
xander_harris I-i-it came that way, really, they all said that!
cordelia_chase Just look at that Amber. Who does she think she is, a Laker Girl?
willow_rosenberg I heard she turned them down.
cheerleader_joy Okay, listen up! Let's begin with Amber Grove. If you're not auditioning, move off the floor.
willow_rosenberg Amy! Hi!
amy_madison Hi!
willow_rosenberg I didn't know you wanted to be a cheerleader! You lost a lot of weight.
amy_madison Had to.
willow_rosenberg Do you know Buffy?
amy_madison Hi.
buffy_summers Hi.
amy_madison Oh, how I hate this, let me count the ways.
amy_madison She trained with Benson. He's one of the best coaches money can buy.
buffy_summers They have cheerleading coaches?
amy_madison Oh, yeah! Don't you have? I train with my mom, three hours in the morning, three at night.
buffy_summers Hmm, that much quality time with my mom would probably lead to some quality matricide.
amy_madison Oh, I know it's hokey. But she's really great.
cordelia_chase Hmm!
buffy_summers What the...?
willow_rosenberg That girl's on fire!
cordelia_chase Enough of the hyperbole!
buffy_summers It's okay, it's okay, you're gonna be... okay. God!
buffy_summers I've been slaying vampires for more than a year now, and I have seen some pretty cringeworthy things, but... nobody's hands ever got toasted before.
rupert_giles I imagine not.
buffy_summers So, this isn't a vampire problem.
rupert_giles No.
buffy_summers But it is funky, right? Not of the norm?
rupert_giles Quite. Spontaneous human combustion is, is rare, and, and scientifically unexplainable, but there have been cases for hundreds of years. Usually all that's left is a pile of ashes.
willow_rosenberg That's all that would have been left if it hadn't been for Buffy.
xander_harris So, we have no idea what caused this. That's a comfort.
rupert_giles But that's the thrill of living on the Hellmouth! There's a veritable cornucopia of, of fiends and devils and, and ghouls to engage. Pardon me for finding the glass half full.
buffy_summers Any common denominators in cases of spontaneous combustion?
rupert_giles Uh, rage. In most cases the person who combusted was, was terribly angry or, or upset.
xander_harris So maybe Amber's got this power to make herself be on fire. It's like the human torch, only it hurts.
buffy_summers I need to get the skinny on Amber. Find out if she's had any colorful episodes before.
willow_rosenberg That means hacking illegally into the school's computer system. At last, something *I* can do!
xander_harris I'll ask around about her.
buffy_summers You guys don't have to get involved.
xander_harris What d'ya mean? We're a team! Aren't we a team?
willow_rosenberg Yeah! You're the Slayer, and we're, like, the Slayerettes!
buffy_summers I just don't like putting you guys in danger.
xander_harris Oh, huh, I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.
buffy_summers Okay, just walk softly, at least until we know a little more. I mean, what if Amber isn't causing these problems herself?
rupert_giles Well, then we have to determine who or what did, and, uh, deal with it accordingly.
buffy_summers Hey!
joyce_summers Hi, how was school?
buffy_summers Mm, a reverent joy. What's all this?
joyce_summers It's for the tribal art display.
buffy_summers Cool! We had tryouts today.
joyce_summers Oh, great! How'd it go?
buffy_summers I didn't actually get to try out. There was an accident. Pretty fierce competition, though.
joyce_summers Oh, I know you'll do fine. Keep on pluggin', just have to get back on the horse.
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Yeah?
buffy_summers What was I trying out for?
joyce_summers Oh, uh... Some activity? I have no idea, I'm sorry.
buffy_summers That's okay. Your platitudes are good for all occasions.
joyce_summers I'm distracted. Got a lotta inventory to go through here. This is my Gallery's first major show. You know, it might not physically kill you to give me a hand here.
buffy_summers It was cheerleading.
joyce_summers Oh good! I'm glad you're taking that up again, it'll keep you out of trouble.
buffy_summers I'm not *in* trouble.
joyce_summers No, not yet.
joyce_summers I mean, you stopped cheerleading just before the trouble, so it's good you're going back.
joyce_summers Oh, dear.
buffy_summers What?
joyce_summers The fertility statue, you don't need to see it.
buffy_summers Y'know, there's this girl, Amy, and, um, she trains with her mom, like, three hours a day.
joyce_summers Uh-huh.
buffy_summers Sounds like her mom's pretty into it.
joyce_summers Sounds like her mom doesn't have a lot to do.
buffy_summers Jeepers!
cheerleader_joy Despite the terrible thing that happened yesterday we still have to pick new cheerleaders. If you make the team you'll find your names posted in the quad after lunch. Let's begin with group performance.
amy_madison Why do my hands have to sweat when I get nervous?
buffy_summers Don't worry. You'll do great.
cheerleader_joy Five, six, seven, eight!
All#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season01.Episode03 Sunnydale! Sunnydale! We never fail! We never fail! Jump and Shoot! Swish and score! The other team is such a bore! Yeah!
cordelia_chase You saw that, right? That wasn't me! You saw that, right? Right?
amy_madison That's my mom!
buffy_summers No! Catherine Madison. Get down with your bad self!
amy_madison Her nickname was 'Catherine the Great'. She took that team and made them tri-county champions. Y'know, no one's ever done that before, or since. She and my dad were Homecoming King and Queen. They got married right after graduation.
buffy_summers That's kinda romantic.
amy_madison Well, he was a big loser. Never made any money. Ran off with Miss Trailer Trash when I was twelve.
buffy_summers Okay, that part's less romantic. My folks split up, too.
amy_madison Drag, huh? Uh, he left my mom with nothing. She put herself through cosmetology school. Bought me everything I ever wanted. And never once gained a single pound.
buffy_summers Uh, she sounds really great, Amy, but, um... it doesn't mean that you need to lock step as far as this cheerleading thing.
amy_madison She was the best! And I can't get my body to *move* like hers! I choked in there so bad!
buffy_summers No, Amy, you did fine.
amy_madison I'm gonna get changed.
buffy_summers Wait! No...
willow_rosenberg Hey, Amy! Is she okay?
buffy_summers No, she's, she's wiggin' about her mom, big cheer queen back when.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, her mom's kinda...
buffy_summers ...Nazi like?
willow_rosenberg Heil. If she gains an ounce she padlocks the fridge and won't eat anything but broth.
buffy_summers So, mommy dearest is really... Mommy Dearest?
willow_rosenberg There's a bitter streak. But Amy's nice. We used to hang in Junior High. When her mom would go on a broth kick, Amy'd come over to my house and we'd stuff ourselves with brownies!
buffy_summers Hey, any word on Amber?
willow_rosenberg Nothing thrilling. Average student. Got detention once, for smoking. Regular smoking... with a cigarette, not, like, being smoky.
buffy_summers Hmm.
willow_rosenberg All pretty normal.
buffy_summers So we just have to wait and we'll see what happens. Maybe nothing will.
cordelia_chase I have a dream. It's me on the cheerleading squad, adored by every varsity male as far as the eye can see! We have to achieve our dreams, Amy. Otherwise we... wither and die!
amy_madison Look, I'm sorry about...
cordelia_chase Shhh! If your supreme klutziness out there today takes me out of the running, you're gonna be so *very* beyond sorry! Have a nice day.
willow_rosenberg I told Buffy about Amber.
xander_harris Cool! Was she wearin' it? The bracelet, she was wearin' it, right? Pretty much like we're goin' out.
willow_rosenberg Except without the hugging or kissing or her knowing about it.
xander_harris So I'm just a figure of fun. I should ask her out, right?
willow_rosenberg You won't know till you ask.
xander_harris That's why you're so cool! You're like a guy! You're my guy friend that knows about girl stuff!
willow_rosenberg Oh, great. I'm a guy.
xander_harris Oh, hey, they're posting the list!
amy_madison I can't take this.
lishanne Yes!
xander_harris Cover me, I'm goin' in.
cordelia_chase You're lucky!
amy_madison I made it?
cordelia_chase *I* made it!
xander_harris One of those girls hit me really hard! You should test for steroids. Okay, not only did you make the team, but you, Miss Summers, are the first alternate, and Amy's number three.
xander_harris And what a better way to celebrate than with a romantic drive through...
willow_rosenberg Xander, alternates are the ones who didn't make the team, they only fill in if something happens to the ones who did.
buffy_summers Excuse me.
xander_harris For I am Xander, King of Cretins. May all lesser cretins bow before me.
buffy_summers At least it's over. And you know what I think we should do about it? Brownie pig-out, my house, after school.
amy_madison It's just how many more hours a day can I practice? Y'know, how much more can I do? This would never happen to my mother. Never.
amy_madison Give me the power. Give me the dark.
amy_madison I call on you, the laughing gods.
amy_madison Let your blackness crawl beneath my skin.
amy_madison Accept thy sacrifice... of Cordelia. Feed on her.
joyce_summers Look what I found. It's my yearbook from junior year. Oh, look! There I am.
buffy_summers Mom, I've accepted that you've had sex. I am not ready to know that you had Farrah hair.
joyce_summers This is Gidget hair. Don't they teach you anything in history?
buffy_summers Well, it's really cool, but I gotta book.
joyce_summers Well, I was thinking. I know the cheerleading thing didn't work out... Maybe you should think about joining the yearbook staff. I did, it was a lot of fun.
buffy_summers Not really my tip, mom.
joyce_summers I was, uh, photo editor. I got to be on every page, made me look much more popular than I was.
buffy_summers And have you seen the kids that do yearbook? Nerds pick on them.
joyce_summers Some of the best times I had in school were working on the yearbook!
buffy_summers Oh, this just in: I'm not you! I'm into my own thing.
joyce_summers Your own thing, whatever it is, got you kicked out of school, and we had to move here to find a decent school that would take you!
joyce_summers Honey, uhhh... Uhhh! Great parenting form! Little shaky on the dismount.
xander_harris Cordelia, you haven't been mean to me all day. Is it something I've done? Okay, see how she has no clue that I'm even a mammal, much less a human being?
willow_rosenberg I see that.
xander_harris This is the invisible man syndrome. A blessing in Cordelia's case. A curse in Buffy's.
willow_rosenberg You're not invisible to Buffy.
xander_harris It's worse! I'm just like a part of the scenery, like an old shoe. Or a rug that you walk on every day but don't even really see it.
willow_rosenberg Like a pen that's all chewed up, and you know you should throw it away, but you don't, not 'cause you like it so much, more 'cause you're just used to...
xander_harris Will, yeah, that is the point, you don't have to drive it through my head like a railroad spike. I'm gonna take your advice and not beat around the bush.
willow_rosenberg Or I could be wrong! Maybe you should beat around the bush more.
xander_harris Nah, I gotta be a man and ask her out. Y'know, I gotta stop giving her ID bracelets, uh, subtle innuendoes, taking Polaroids outside of her bedroom window late at night, that last part is a joke to relieve the tension because here she comes.
xander_harris Okay, into battle I go. Would you ask her out for me?
xander_harris No. Man. Me battle. Buffy! Would you like to, uh...
buffy_summers Is that even Cordelia's locker?
xander_harris Huh? Oh, I don't know. What I'm saying is accompany me Friday night...
buffy_summers Xander, I have to, um... We can make this up later. You don't mind, do you?
mr_pole Nice of you to join us, Cordelia. We didn't keep you waiting or anything, did we? It's your turn to drive. Okay, people, let's buckle up.
cordelia_chase I don't wanna drive today, Mr. Pole.
mr_pole You've flunked Driver's Ed. twice already. Show me some moves, or you'll be taking the bus to college.
mr_pole Okay. Check the brake. Check the mirror. Start the engine.
mr_pole Hello? Put the car in drive.
mr_pole Let's move forward through the cones with a gentle even turn to the...
mr_pole Slow down. Slow, slow, turn right! Turn right!
mr_pole Brakes! Brakes!
mr_pole Everybody out!
cordelia_chase Oh, my God, I, I can't see anything!
buffy_summers It's, it's okay, it's... Oh God!
cordelia_chase What's happening? I can't see anything!
rupert_giles Witchcraft. Blinding your enemy to disorient and disable them is, it's classic!
xander_harris First vampires, now witches. No wonder you can still afford a house in Sunnydale.
rupert_giles Why should someone want to harm Cordelia?
willow_rosenberg Maybe because they met her? Did I say that?
rupert_giles And setting Amber ablaze?
xander_harris Yeah, those guys don't hang...
buffy_summers They're both cheerleaders.
rupert_giles Someone doesn't like cheerleading.
buffy_summers Or likes it too much.
willow_rosenberg Amy!
buffy_summers Amy!
xander_harris So, you guys are leaning towards Amy?
buffy_summers She's desperate to get on that team, and I've got this feeling she'd do just about anything to make her mom's dream come true.
rupert_giles Uh, let me make sure I have this right. This witch is casting horrible and disfiguring spells so that she can become a cheerleader?
buffy_summers I think you're underestimating the amount of pressure a parent can lay on you. If you're not a picture perfect carbon copy they tend to wig.
willow_rosenberg Cheerleading was kind of her mom's last hurrah.
xander_harris Look, we still have to stop Amy. We should grab her and...
rupert_giles I think we should be sure she's the witch before we arouse her suspicions. She's, she's capable of some fairly unpleasant things.
buffy_summers Okay, alright, so, you're in high school, you are desperate to make the team and please your mom, so you turn to witchcraft. What's the first thing you're gonna do?
willow_rosenberg Check out the books on witchcraft!
xander_harris Uh, no! No, that would be the *last* thing you would do! You don't wanna leave a paper trail. Forget that!
willow_rosenberg It'll just take a minute.
xander_harris We don't have a minute! Cheerleaders are in danger. Buffy's in danger. You were the first alternate, you are on the team now that Cordelia's out. You could be next. We gotta get you to a safe house.
willow_rosenberg Xander...
xander_harris Yeah.
willow_rosenberg 'Witches: Historic Roots to Modern Practice.' Checked out by Alexander Harris.
buffy_summers 'The Pagan Rites', checked out by Alexander...
xander_harris Alright, alright, it's not what you think.
willow_rosenberg You like to look at the semi-nude engravings?
xander_harris Oh, well, uh, I-I guess it *is* what you think.
rupert_giles Have you all quite finished? We have to find a conclusive test. There may be something in here... Yes, this should do it. You'll need some of her hair, a little quicksilver and some aqua fortis.
willow_rosenberg Well, that's just mercury and nitric acid. You can get that in the science lab.
rupert_giles 'Heat ingredients and apply to witch, and if a spell has been cast in the previous 48 hours, witch's skin turns blue.' Hmm. Oh, and you'll need some Eye of Newt.
dr_gregory Those of you in track one may begin your dissections... now.
dr_gregory Those of you in track two take your hydrochloric acid and your ammonium hydroxide and carefully pour them into your beakers.
dr_gregory Now slow, slow...
xander_harris I can't.
dr_gregory ...capping one, I'm being safe. And you get...
willow_rosenberg Eye of Newt!
dr_gregory ...that.
xander_harris How's Buffy doing with the hair?
lishanne Isn't this exciting!
buffy_summers Oh, yeah! Amy, help me. Um, which is the hydrochloric acid and which is the, uh, ammonium hydroxide?
amy_madison Well, the bottle that says 'hydrochloric acid' is usually the hydrochloric acid.
buffy_summers Read the bottles. Good concept! Oops.
xander_harris Wave 'Hi' to the nice little witch!
willow_rosenberg All set. Do you have a plan?
buffy_summers Spill it on her. Try 'n' make it look natural.
xander_harris We're right behind you, only... further back.
dr_gregory Lishanne, can you tell me why these chemicals have this reaction?
dr_gregory Lishanne?
dr_gregory Are you... Oh, my God!
xander_harris Did you see? Amy was as freaked out as the rest of us.
willow_rosenberg So it's not her?
buffy_summers The test was positive! She's our Sabrina. I just don't think she realizes what she's doing.
willow_rosenberg Well, should we talk to her?
buffy_summers Maybe we should talk to her mother. I wonder if *she* knows what she's created.
amy_madison Where are you?
amy_madison Another productive day in front of the TV?
amy_madison I got a history report due tomorrow. Write it!
amy_madison I should be on that team by now. But instead Miss *Buffy* and friends are sneaking around stealing bits of my hair.
amy_madison I'll be upstairs.
buffy_summers Oh! Oops! Oh... Mm...
buffy_summers Macho, macho, man! I want to be a macho man. Macho... Oh, hey, juice! Mm... Quality juice. Not from concentrate!
joyce_summers You're in a good mood.
buffy_summers I am! I'm on the squad, which is great, 'cause I feel like cheering and leading others to cheer. Ooo, hey, juice!
joyce_summers Listen, honey, about yesterday, I really...
buffy_summers Mm! That is totally yester. Besides, it's not like you were wrong, y'know. I did get kicked outta school. I'm just wacky that way!
joyce_summers Still, I just want you to know that, despite the problems you've had, I really...
buffy_summers Mom, you just don't get it. And, believe me, you don't want it. Y'know, there are just some things about being a Vampire Slayer that the older generation...
joyce_summers A what?
buffy_summers It's a... long story.
joyce_summers Buffy, are you feeling well?
buffy_summers What? Oh, I'm, I'm fine, y'know? What, like, I can't be in a good mood? Is it, like, a new house rule? Fine, y'know? It's just fine, fine, fine, 'cause... I'm a macho, macho man! I want to be a macho man! Macho, macho man! I want to be a macho man!
cheerleader_joy Five, six, seven, eight!
buffy_summers Turn up the music!
cheerleader_joy Ow! Get it together Buffy! We have a game in less than four hours!
buffy_summers Willow! Xander! My buds are here! I love my buds! Hi! Hi... Oh...
xander_harris Is it me, or is Buffy a bit looped?
willow_rosenberg We better get her outta there.
xander_harris Yeah, before she...
xander_harris ...hurts someone. Ay...
buffy_summers Did I do that?
cheerleader_joy You are *so* out of here!
willow_rosenberg It's not her fault!
xander_harris She's on medication.
buffy_summers What?
cheerleader_joy Well, obviously not enough. Who's our next alternate? Oh. Amy, you just made cheerleader.
buffy_summers No, no, no. You don't want her, she's a wi...
xander_harris A wise choice indeed!
buffy_summers She's a witchy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy...
buffy_summers I just got kicked off the team, didn't I?
xander_harris I don't think it was your fault.
buffy_summers Hmm, I know you don't, that's 'cause you're my friend. You're my Xander-shaped friend! Do you have any idea why I love you so, Xander?
willow_rosenberg We gotta to get her to a...
xander_harris Let her speak!
buffy_summers I'll tell you! You're not like other boys at all.
xander_harris Well...
buffy_summers You are totally, and completely one of the girls! I'm that comfy with him.
xander_harris That's great.
buffy_summers Any other guy who'd give me a bracelet, they'd... wanna date me, and be like a...
buffy_summers Oh! I, I don't feel so good.
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
willow_rosenberg We've gotta get her to a hospital!
rupert_giles They can't help her. This is a bloodstone vengeance spell. Hits the body hard like a, a quart of alcohol, and then it e-eradicates the, uh, immune system.
xander_harris A vengeance spell, like she's trying to get even with Buffy?
buffy_summers 'Cause she knows I know she's a witch.
rupert_giles The others she just wanted out of the running. You she intends to, um...
buffy_summers Kill?
willow_rosenberg How much time do we have?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, I'm sure, uh...
buffy_summers Truth. Please.
rupert_giles Couple of hours... Three at most.
xander_harris Well, how do we reverse the spell?
rupert_giles Well I, I've been researching that, and, uh, we can reverse all the spells if, um... ...we can just lay our hands on, on Amy's spell book.
willow_rosenberg And if we can't get a hold of it?
rupert_giles Well, the other way is to cut the witch's head off.
xander_harris Show of hands!
buffy_summers It's not Amy's fault. She only became a witch to survive her mother.
xander_harris Look, I don't care why, I just care that you go on breathing.
buffy_summers Giles, where would she be casting these spells?
rupert_giles Oh, she needs a, a sacred space. A-a-a pentagram, um, large pot.
buffy_summers Her home. Okay. Help me up.
buffy_summers We'll just go to her house and we'll get her book.
willow_rosenberg Okay, we'll go with you.
buffy_summers Uh, no! You guys stay here and keep an eye on Amy.
rupert_giles And keep her away from the science lab. We'll need it to cast our counter-spells.
catherine_madison Who are you? Wha, um, uh, is there something wrong?
rupert_giles Mrs. Madison, we need to talk to you about your daughter.
catherine_madison I'm not allow... You'll have to come back later.
rupert_giles Excuse me!
catherine_madison What?!
rupert_giles You alright? Um, in here. Your daughter is meddling with something very dangerous, are you aware of that?
catherine_madison Uh, I don't know what you're talking about.
rupert_giles Oh, I think you know only too well.
catherine_madison You've got to go. She's gonna be home soon, and you...
rupert_giles This girl is very sick. Now you will shut up and you will listen to me! Your daughter has access to some very powerful magicks, and somehow your obsession with cheerleading has made...
catherine_madison I don't care about cheerleading! It's not my fault she's doing stuff.
rupert_giles As her mother you should assume some responsibility for her actions.
catherine_madison Well, you know, these kids today! I... She's out of her mind. Ever since dad, her dad... left I can't control her.
rupert_giles You're afraid of her?
buffy_summers Amy?
buffy_summers Are you Amy?
rupert_giles I don't understand.
buffy_summers She switched! She switched your bodies, didn't she?
rupert_giles Good Lord!
buffy_summers She wanted to relive her glory days.
catherine_madison She said I was wasting my youth. So she took it.
catherine_madison I didn't know anything about her powers. I mean, when dad was here they would fight and yell and he would... call her a witch and... I mean, I would, just thought he meant... Oh, God, when he left I wanted to go with him. But she wouldn't even let me call. She went crazy, I mean, she'd lock herself upstairs for days, and she was always coming down on me, telling me I didn't deserve to have it so easy, and that I didn't know... how hard it was to be her, and... I guess she showed me, huh?
buffy_summers Amy, it's gonna be okay.
catherine_madison A few months ago, I woke up in h... her bed! I didn't know where I was, and... then I looked in the mirror...
rupert_giles She locked herself upstairs?
catherine_madison Yes.
rupert_giles Where?
catherine_madison Don't! If she finds out I've been here she'll kill me!
rupert_giles My God! I believe we can reverse your mother's spell. Well, all of them, in fact.
catherine_madison You could? Really, you could?
rupert_giles We need to find her books. There'd be specific volumes she'd need for this kind of casting.
rupert_giles Collect those dolls, and, uh, any other personal effects...
rupert_giles Ah! Nice kitty... Let's see what you were guarding. Ah, yes! This is it.
buffy_summers Did we find?
rupert_giles We found. Come on.
catherine_madison But where are you going?
rupert_giles We're going to school.
rupert_giles And you're coming with us.
rupert_giles I'm gonna stop this. I promise.
rupert_giles You just hang on.
catherine_madison How is she?
rupert_giles We only have a few minutes left.
cheerleader Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go! Six, seven, eight! Go Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go! Six, seven, eight! Go Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go! Six, seven, eight! Go Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go, Sunnydale go! Go!
rupert_giles Right! Here we go!
rupert_giles The center is dark. Centrum est obscurus. The darkness breathes. Tenebrae respiratis. The listener hears. Hear me!
catherine_madison Oh, it's... it's working!
rupert_giles Unlock the gate. Let the darkness shine. Cover us with holy fear.
rupert_giles Show me...
cheerleader_joy Amy, what's your problem?
catherine_madison She's coming!
willow_rosenberg Amy!
amy_madison Get out of my way!
willow_rosenberg W-wait! I-I-I need to talk to you, I-I can help you.
amy_madison Help me? With what?
willow_rosenberg Uh, well, y'know, all your witchcraft! I, I know this really good cauldron.
willow_rosenberg Do you actually ride a broom?
willow_rosenberg Xander!
rupert_giles Corsheth and Gilail! The gate is closed! Receive the dark! Release the unworthy! Take of mine energy and be sated!
rupert_giles Be sated! Release the unworthy!
rupert_giles Release!
rupert_giles Release!
rupert_giles RELEEEEASE!
amy_madison Buffy?
buffy_summers Amy?
rupert_giles You... you...
catherine_madison You! You little brat!
amy_madison Mom! Please!
catherine_madison How dare you raise your hand to your mother! I gave you birth. I gave up my life so you could drag that worthless carcass around and call it living? You've never been anything but trouble. I'm going to put you where you can't make trouble again!
buffy_summers Guess what?
buffy_summers I feel better!
catherine_madison That body was mine! Mine!
buffy_summers Oh, grow up!
catherine_madison I shall look upon my enemy!
catherine_madison I shall look upon her and the dark place will have her soul!
catherine_madison Corsheth, take her!
rupert_giles Well, that was, um, interesting.
buffy_summers You guys okay?
amy_madison I'm fine!
rupert_giles I assume the, uh, all the spells are reversed. It was my first casting, so... I may have got it wrong.
buffy_summers You saved my life! You were a god!
amy_madison Well, I didn't think you'd pull it off.
xander_harris I got her! I got her! Cut her head off!
buffy_summers Xander, what are you doing?
xander_harris Saving you?
buffy_summers Get your hands off of her.
xander_harris But she's evil.
rupert_giles It wasn't exactly her.
amy_madison I was my mom.
xander_harris Oh!
willow_rosenberg Where is she?!
xander_harris Uh, hey Willow! It's cool!
willow_rosenberg It is?
xander_harris Yeah, I took care of it.
joyce_summers I don't get it.
buffy_summers What?
joyce_summers I've been doing a lot of thinking about... where you're coming from, how to relate to you... and I've come to a very simple conclusion: I don't get it.
buffy_summers I'm inscrutable, huh?
joyce_summers You're sixteen. I think there's a, a biological imperative whereby I can't understand you because I'm not sixteen.
buffy_summers Do you ever wish you could be sixteen again?
joyce_summers Oh, that's a frightful notion. Go through all that again? Not even if it helped me understand you.
buffy_summers I love you, mom.
joyce_summers I don't get it!
amy_madison My dad is *so* impossible! He doesn't ever want me going anywhere! He wants to spend total quantity time together. And I'm, like, 'Dad, I can go out, it's perfectly safe!' But he's got all this guilt about leaving me with my mom. And he's being a total pain.
buffy_summers You're loving it.
amy_madison Every single minute.
amy_madison This Saturday night he wants to stay in and make brownies. Well, the brownies were my idea.
cordelia_chase Hey, I'm really sorry you guys got bumped back to alternate. Hold it, wait... No I'm not!
amy_madison Well, I know that I'll miss the intellectual thrill of spelling out words with my arms.
cordelia_chase Ooo, these grapes are sour!
amy_madison Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that you wanted to be on the squad.
buffy_summers Oh, hey, that's okay. Cheerleading's just a little too hairy for me these days.
amy_madison That's for sure.
amy_madison Catherine the Great.
buffy_summers And there's been no sign of her?
amy_madison That last spell... She said I'd never make trouble again. Wherever she is I don't think we'll have to worry.
buffy_summers Twisted.
amy_madison I'm just happy to have my body back. I'm thinking of getting fat.
buffy_summers Y'know, I hear that look's in for spring.
