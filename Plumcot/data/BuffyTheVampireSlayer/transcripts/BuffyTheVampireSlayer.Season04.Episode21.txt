professor_maggie_walsh Almost time to wake up, Adam, and take your first look at the world. I know you're gonna make me proud.
professor_maggie_walsh Aah!
rupert_giles Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
professor_maggie_walsh Adam...
adam Spike, I want you to come with me. You're going to help me with my problem.
spike Slayer's got powers.
adam Take them away from her.
spike This all goes down, the chip comes out.
adam Scout's Honor.
forrest_gates Riley had a career. He had a future 'till he met you and yeah, I got a problem with that.
adam Thank you.
buffy_summers Okay, Adam was at that cave, so maybe he was there for a reason. I'll go back, I'll scope it out
rupert_giles You don't train with me anymore. He's going to kick your ass.
buffy_summers Giles!
xander_harris Stupid. So you finally had the guts to say it to my face.
willow_rosenberg What exactly do you mean by 'witch stuff'?
buffy_summers You guys, what is happening?!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, things have been wrong for a while!
buffy_summers I'm starting to understand why there's no ancient prophecy about a Chosen One and her friends.
buffy_summers If I need help, I'll go to someone I can count on.
adam I've been waiting for you.
riley_finn And now I'm here.
buffy_summers Riley?
buffy_summers Riley?
adam Your thoughts are troubled. In turmoil. I understand, brother. We have a lot to discuss. Speak.
riley_finn What have you done to me?
adam Nothing. It was mother, Your...Professor Walsh. She implanted the behavior modifier.
riley_finn A chip in my head. She really did it.
adam Actually, the chip is here. Tied directly into your central nervous system through your thoracic nerve. This is Phase One of your preparation. It lay dormant until the time came. I simply activated it, brother.
riley_finn Stop calling me that. I'm not your brother. You're a botched science experiment. I'm a human being, who's gonna do everything in his power to
adam Sit.
adam You have no power. Not yet. Once you forget your old life and embrace your destiny as I have, you will know power you've never dreamed of. I think you're going to like it.
adam Humans claim to old ways and ancient feuds. And they're hopeless with technology. Unworthy.
riley_finn Not really wanting a lecture right now.
adam Disappointed by demon-kind, we turned to humans. Smart, adaptive, but emotional and weak. Blind. There's imperfection everywhere. Something must be done. Who will deliver us?
adam Mother. She saw our future. Yours and mine. She saw that you were necessary. She saw the role you will play by my side. Stand up.
adam You see, we are brothers after all.
spike It warms the cockles of my non-beating heart seeing you lads together.
adam I didn't send for you, Spike.
spike Yeah, well...I'm not much the being-sent-for type.
spike I'm much more the I did my part, now get this chip out of my head kind of guy.
spike Slightly stiffer than usual.
spike Subtle, but I like it.
spike What's with him?
adam I activated his chip.
spike Oh, so, it's chips all around, is it? Someone must've bought the party-pack.
adam You get yours removed when the Slayer is where I want her.
spike She's separated from her friends.
spike They want nothing to do with her.
spike She's all alone.
adam That's how I want her. Where I want her is down in the Initiative. She will ensure that as many demons die as humans, she will achieve maximum carnage before she's too weak to go on.
riley_finn No. You can't
adam Stop talking.
spike Right. The Initiative. But getting her therethat's what the bleeding disks are for, isn't it? Our little witch gives her the info and popAlice heads back down the rabbit hole.
adam The witch.
spike Uh, Willow. About so high, perky, good with math. Natural choice.
adam A friend.
spike Right.
adam One of the friends from whom you so efficiently separated her.
spike Damn right I did. You should've seen her. They won't be talking to each other for a long, long
spike Hang on. I think I might've detected a small flaw.
adam So you failed.
spike Well, hey, you're supposed to be so smart. You let me plan this thing. Okay, let's not quibble about who failed who. The important thing is make sure the Slayer is where we want
adam Go.
spike Gone.
spike So, uh, we'll do this chip thing when I get back.
rupert_giles Oh...
willow_rosenberg Hey.
rupert_giles Hello. Um, oh, uh, pardon the robe. It's a bit of a late start.
willow_rosenberg Right.
tara_maclay I hope you're feeling all right, Mr. Giles.
rupert_giles Oh, yes, quite well, thank you. I'llI'll probably have a brisk jog later on. Did you want something?
willow_rosenberg I forgot my laptop and the disks.
rupert_giles Uh, yes, please, please come in.
rupert_giles Will you be working here? Uh, typing...talking? Because, um, that will be fine.
willow_rosenberg No, that's okay.
willow_rosenberg Got 'em. So...see ya.
rupert_giles Right. Yes, well, good luck withwith all that.
willow_rosenberg Ok. Bye.
tara_maclay Bye.
rupert_giles Bye.
anya Xander?
anya You said you wanted to check the board at the unemployment office this morning.
anya You can't go like that. They won't even interview you if you're naked.
xander_harris I'm not going. There's never anything good.
xander_harris Maybe I should join the Army.
anya Don't they make you get up really early in the morning?
xander_harris Oh, yeah.
xander_harris Never mind.
anya Are you still upset about that fight you had with your friends? It was hours ago! Get over it.
xander_harris Anya, youForget it.
anya So, they all think you're lost, directionless loser with no plans for his future? Pfft.
xander_harris Anya, you can't pfft that stuff away.
anya Why not?
xander_harris I don't know. 'Cause I think maybe they're right.
anya So what if they are? You're a good person, and a good boyfriend, and...and I'm in love with you. Whatever they think of you, it shouldn't matter.
xander_harris Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't matter.
buffy_summers Adam...where are you?
adam This is where it all happens. Where the new race begins.
riley_finn Where are we?
adam In the Initiative. There are areas no one knew about beyond those that needed to. Mother kept her secrets well.
adam Didn't you?
adam This is all how she planned it, except she thought she would be alive.
riley_finn Are you
riley_finn Is that what you were gonna do to me?
adam They're just workers. You know your destiny is much greater.
riley_finn Forrest? Oh, God.
forrest_gates God has nothing to do with it.
spike Easy, Sheriff. Watch where you point that thing.
buffy_summers What are you doing here?
spike Looking for a little weekend getaway place. Shove off.
spike Oh, cripes. That's all I need. Runnin' into that goon.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, Adam's cleared out of here. Whatever he's planning is about to go down.
spike Look at little Nancy Drew. What about those disks I nabbed? They ought to tell you something.
buffy_summers Willow has the disks.
spike Well, then I'd get on that.
spike Can't ignore valuable information
spike just 'cause you two birds fell out, now can you?
buffy_summers Right.
spike Well, you do what you want.
spike No worry of mine, now is it?
tara_maclay Maybe you should rest. Clear your head?
willow_rosenberg Can't. Not now. II think I'm on to something. I've been assuming thethe ciphertext was encrypted with an asymmetric algorithm. Then it hit me. A hexogonic key pattern. It's
tara_maclay Hey, look, you did it.
willow_rosenberg I didn't. I haven't even finished typing in the new code.
tara_maclay Something's doing it.
willow_rosenberg Must be programmed to self-decrypt to a certain point. That is so annoying. It's like someone blurting out the answer to a riddle just when you'veI mean Yippee! We have the information.
tara_maclay I'm not sure if Yippee's the right response, either. Read that.
tara_maclay Hello? Yeah, she's rightI mean, let me check.
tara_maclay It's Buffy.
riley_finn Professor Walsh. Professor Walsh, it's Riley Finn. Can you hear me?
forrest_gates She's dead. Artificially reanimated with basic to moderate brain activity. Mommy can hear you, but she's still a walking corpse.
riley_finn So are you.
forrest_gates Mm-mmm. Got that wrong. I'm surging with life... and strength. Adam made me to be nearly as bad as he is. Really looking forward to trying out your girl again.
riley_finn I'm sorry, Forrest.
forrest_gates Don't be. This is the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm free of all my weaknesses...my doubts. He's gonna fix you up too, soon as we got some choice parts. Then you and me will be back on the same side again. Moving toward a new future.
riley_finn I'll never let that happen.
forrest_gates You don't get it brother, you don't have a choice. Your will belongs to us now.
riley_finn No. That's not true.
forrest_gates Then why don't you get out of that chair and walk out of here?
riley_finn You can't control my
professor_maggie_walsh Riley, be a good boy.
buffy_summers Where's Anya?
xander_harris Oddly, Anya decided not to join us, despite all the fun we had at our last meeting.
willow_rosenberg And I don't think Tara felt welcome.
buffy_summers Why? Because of the things that we said?
buffy_summers Will, who told you we were talking behind your back, specifically?
rupert_giles Well, uh...SSSpike can be very convincing whenwhenwhen, uh...I'm very stupid.
buffy_summers He played us. He wanted us to fight to split us up. That's where it came from. The stuff we said the other night.
rupert_giles Of course. Well, piffle, let's move on.
xander_harris I'm movin'.
willow_rosenberg Me, too.
buffy_summers Good. Great.
willow_rosenberg So...why do you think Spike made with the head games?
xander_harris He's all dressed up with no one to bite. He's gotta get his ya-yas somehow.
xander_harris Spike's working for Adam?! After all we've donenah, I can't even act surprised.
buffy_summers I just went to Adam's lair and he was gone. But, Spike just happened to be there. He made this big noise about getting information off those encrypted disks.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I decrypted them.
willow_rosenberg Well, they decrypted themselves, but I almost had it.
rupert_giles What did they say?
willow_rosenberg A bunch of stuff we already know about 314. But it also said there's some final phase where Adam manufactures a bunch of creepy cyber-demonoids like him. There's a special lab in The Initiative, but it didn't say where.
buffy_summers Adam fed Spike those disks. It has to be. He wanted me to know about his evil-guy assembly line. This lab, it's in the Initiative?
willow_rosenberg Hidden somewhere.
buffy_summers We'll give the demon his due. He thought this one out.
willow_rosenberg What do you mean?
buffy_summers You know how overcrowded the containment cells have been at the Initiative?
buffy_summers Those demons were just too easy to catch. It's like they wanted in that place.
rupert_giles The Trojan horse.
buffy_summers Adam's gonna make sure the demons attack the Initiative from the inside.
xander_harris Demons versus soldiers. Massacre, massacre.
willow_rosenberg And Adam has a neat pile of body parts to start assembling his army. Diabolical, yet...Gross.
xander_harris Does anybody else miss the Mayor, I just wanna be a big snake?
buffy_summers I've got to shut him down, Giles. His final phase is about to start.
rupert_giles We need to warn the Initiative.
buffy_summers They're not gonna listen to me.
willow_rosenberg Riley?
buffy_summers He's a deserter. He got some bad news anyway, and kinda took off.
xander_harris Okay, I'm confused again. Adam has this evil plan. Why is he so anxious for you to know about it?
buffy_summers He wants me there. Probably figures I'll even the kill ratio.
xander_harris He's not worried you might kill, oh say, him?
buffy_summers No, he's really not.
adam She's coming. I can feel it.
spike Good on you. Got a chunk of prognosticating demon in there, right?
spike Now, if you'll just get this chip out of my cranium...I'll be out of your way. And mind the hairline. I don't fancy fussing over a comb-over as I resume my killing ways. Come on, we had a deal.
adam When she's here.
rupert_giles Certainly no lack of supplies. I only wish I knew which ones would kill Adam.
buffy_summers According to Riley, his power source is uranium core embedded somewhere inside his chest. Probably near the spine.
xander_harris Great, so we just ask him to lie down quietly while we do some exploratory surgery.
willow_rosenberg What about magic? Some kind of, I don't know...uranium extracting spell?
willow_rosenberg I know. I'm reaching.
rupert_giles Perhaps a paralyzing spell.
rupert_giles Only I can't perform the incantation for this.
willow_rosenberg Right. Don't you have to speak it in Sumerian or something?
rupert_giles I do speak Sumerian. It's not that. Only a...an experienced witch can incant it, and you'd have to be within striking distance of this object.
xander_harris See what you get for takin' French instead of Sumerian?
buffy_summers What was I thinking?
xander_harris So no problem, all we need is combo Buffyher with Slayer strength, Giles' multi-lingual know how, and Willow's witchy power.
xander_harris Yeah, don't tell me. I'm just full of helpful suggestions.
rupert_giles As a matter of fact, you are.
willow_rosenberg Nervous?
xander_harris No way. I'm full of that good old kamikaze spirit.
rupert_giles Xander, just because this is never gonna work, there's no need to be negative.
willow_rosenberg The adjoining spell, is it powerful enough to defeat Adam?
rupert_giles It's very powerful. It's also extrodinarily dangerous.
buffy_summers Game faces, guys. We're going in.
buffy_summers How you doing?
willow_rosenberg Super. What was I thinkin', using stairs all this time?
buffy_summers Okay. Will
willow_rosenberg No, really, Buffy. It's not as scary as I thought.
buffy_summers No. It's not what I was gonna say. I just...I'm sorry. I hate that things have been so strained between all of us.
willow_rosenberg It's not your fault. Spike stirred up trouble.
buffy_summers Yeah, but I think trouble was stir-uppable. I think we've all sort of drifted apart this year, don't you?
willow_rosenberg Maybe a little. But, you know, first year of college, it's hard to keep the old high school gang together.
buffy_summers But I want it together. Will, I miss you. And Giles, and Xander. And it is my fault. I've been wrapped up in my own stuff, I've been a bad friend.
willow_rosenberg You're the Slayer, Buffy. Your stuff is pretty crucial.
buffy_summers I mean Riley. And...Riley, mostly.
willow_rosenberg Well, I haven't been Miss Available either. II kept secrets. I hid things from everyone.
buffy_summers That's not your fault. Will, you were going through something huge.
willow_rosenberg I wanted to tell you, but I was so scared.
buffy_summers You can tell me anything. I love you. You're my best friend.
willow_rosenberg Me, too. I love you too.
willow_rosenberg Oh, falling now!
buffy_summers Let's promise to never not talk again.
willow_rosenberg I promise, I promise.
buffy_summers Xander.
willow_rosenberg Oh, wonderful Xander!
buffy_summers You know we love you, right?
willow_rosenberg We totally do.
xander_harris Oh God, we're gonna die, aren't we?
willow_rosenberg No, we just missed you.
xander_harris Giles, hurry up!
xander_harris You definitely wanna get down here for this!
buffy_summers Okay, we stick together, then everything should be fine. Everybody ready?
buffy_summers Let's...
buffy_summers ...do this.
spike Must-See-TV. Bait's been taken. Trap's all set. The Slayer has landed. So...
spike Hello??? Paging Dr. Owe Me One.
adam She's not alone.
adam You've failed me again.
spike Well, that's one way of looking at it.
adam What's the other way.
spike Oh, come on! It's not like I wasn't trying! That's worth something, isn't it?
adam I suppose. Yes. I will honor our agreement to remove your chip.
adam Take his head off.
adam Let him go.
adam There's nowhere left to run.
buffy_summers Colonel
colonel_mcnamara Shut up. You've got some nerve, lady. You think you and your friends can just keep waltzing into a government installation brandishing weapons like
colonel_mcnamara Like
willow_rosenberg It's a gourd.
rupert_giles Magic gourd.
colonel_mcnamara What kind of freaks are you people?
buffy_summers Adam is here, Colonel. In the Initiative.
colonel_mcnamara Nice try.
buffy_summers Those overcrowded containment cells of yours: courtesy of Adam. He's pulling a Trojan Horse on you, he's just waiting
colonel_mcnamara Everything in this installation is under 24-hour surveillance.
willow_rosenberg Including the secret lab?
colonel_mcnamara Including everything! What secret lab?
buffy_summers The one Adam's been using. The one built for the final stage of the 314 project.
buffy_summers And you have no idea what I'm talking about.
colonel_mcnamara I know everything that goes on around here. A tick on a mouse couldn't get in without my knowing it. And if Adam wants to try we're ready for him.
rupert_giles Jolly good. HowHow exactly do you plan to get close enough to Adam to remove his power source?
colonel_mcnamara Hit him simultaneously with multiple taser blasters. Incapacitate him with as much voltage as we can muster.
xander_harris Great plan. That's right up there with duck and cover.
buffy_summers I've seen Adam hit with taser blasts. He feeds on it. And now you're gonna provide him with an all-you-can-eat buffet?
colonel_mcnamara You telling me my business?
buffy_summers This...is not your business. It's mine. You, the Initiative, the boys at the Pentagonyou're all in way over your heads. Messing with primeval forces you have absolutely no comprehension of.
colonel_mcnamara And you do?
buffy_summers I'm the Slayer. You're playing on my turf.
colonel_mcnamara Up there, maybe. But down here, I'm the one who's in control.
Soldier#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Sir, the power grid's down. Backup's not responding.
Soldier#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 We're locked in.
adam This will be interesting.
Scientist#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 What's going on?
Soldier_#2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 I don't know!
Scientist#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Go!
Soldier#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Containment area's been breached. Hostiles are loose.
colonel_mcnamara How many?
Soldier#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 All of 'em, Sir.
buffy_summers It's Adam.
buffy_summers Look, I'm the only one who can stop him now. Just let me handle this. Get your people out of here.
colonel_mcnamara All right, you men follow me. We gotta take the Armory now.
Soldier_#3#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Sir.
buffy_summers Colonel.
colonel_mcnamara These people are under arrest, do you understand?
Soldier_#4#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Yes, sir.
buffy_summers We've gotta find Adam.
willow_rosenberg On it.
rupert_giles The enjoining spell is extremely touchy. It's, uh, volatile. WeWe can't risk it being interrupted. We need a place that's close to you and quiet.
xander_harris Uh...quiet?
buffy_summers How we doing, Will?
willow_rosenberg Done. Hold on. According to this, there's air ducts and electrical conduits all running into there.
buffy_summers So?
willow_rosenberg So, there's no there there. Look.
buffy_summers It's Adam.
rupert_giles You sure?
buffy_summers Right behind 314.
buffy_summers Can you unlock it?
willow_rosenberg I don't have to. AllAll the locks in the Initiative have been disengaged...except for the exits.
xander_harris Demon open house.
buffy_summers Great. So we know we're going to 314. Now all we have to do is get there.
buffy_summers Willow, down!
buffy_summers Come on!
willow_rosenberg Go!
buffy_summers Okay, it should be over here.
buffy_summers Once I'm in, barricade the door behind me. Is this place okay to be Magic Central?
rupert_giles It, uh, should do.
willow_rosenberg As long as we don't get blowed up or nothin'.
xander_harris What're the odds of that?
buffy_summers How long before the ritual kicks in?
rupert_giles Five minutes, give or take.
xander_harris Buffy, I still don't like you going in alone.
buffy_summers I won't be.
buffy_summers Riley.
buffy_summers Are you hurt? Say something!
buffy_summers What is this?
buffy_summers Why won't you talk to me?
adam He can't.
adam He hasn't been programmed to. He's part of the final phase now...as you were supposed to be.
buffy_summers Sorry. I don't jump through hoops on command. I've never really been one to tow the line.
adam Oh. Kill her.
forrest_gates I thought you'd never ask.
willow_rosenberg The power of the Slayer and all who yield it. Last to ancient first, we invoke thee. Grant us thy domain and primal strength. Accept us in the power we possess. Make us mind and heart and spirit joy. Let the hand encompass us. Do thy will.
riley_finn Buffy.
forrest_gates Shut up, and watch me kill your girlfriend, Finn. That's an order.
willow_rosenberg Spiritus...Spirit.
xander_harris Animus...Heart.
rupert_giles Sophus...Mind.
willow_rosenberg And Manus...
willow_rosenberg The hand.
willow_rosenberg We enjoin that we may inhabit the vesselthe hand...daughter of Sineya...first of the ones...
forrest_gates Is that it? Is that all you got?
riley_finn No.
riley_finn She's got me.
forrest_gates Look who's come off the bench.
buffy_summers I need to get to Adam. Like, now. Are you able?
riley_finn Go.
colonel_mcnamara Fall back! Fall back! Protect the flank! Walk down that pit!
buffy_summers Fun, isn't it?
adam I do appreciate violence.
buffy_summers Good.
buffy_summers Broke your arm.
adam Got another.
adam I've been upgrading.
willow_rosenberg We implore thee, admit us, bring us to the vessel, take us now.
adam You can't last much longer.
buffy_summers We can. We are forever.
adam Interesting.
adam Very interesting.
forrest_gates What're you makin' me do this for?
forrest_gates Not that I'm not enjoyin' myself.
forrest_gates But Adam's not gonna like it if I
buffy_summers Kur.
adam How...can you
xander_harris You could never hope to grasp the source
buffy_summers of our power.
buffy_summers But yours is right here.
riley_finn Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Wow. That was
spike Nasty sort of fellow. Lucky for you blighters I was here, eh?
rupert_giles Yes, thank you.
rupert_giles Although your heroism has been slightly muted by the fact that you were helping Adam to start a war that would kill us all.
xander_harris You probably just saved us so we wouldn't stake you right here.
spike Did it work?
spike Well, then everything's all right. And we all get to be not staked through the heart. Good work, team.
rupert_giles Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Wasn't it amazing?
xander_harris You were great.
buffy_summers We were great.
riley_finn We still got men out there.
spike Well, let's go save 'em, by gum.
buffy_summers You guys get to the exits, get 'em open.
buffy_summers You, organize the soldiers, pull 'em back. I'll take point.
willow_rosenberg Are you up to this?
buffy_summers I am.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 It was an experiment. The Initiative represented the Government's interests in not only controlling the otherworldly menace, but harnessing its power for our own military purposes. The considered opinion of this counsel is that this experiment has failed.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Once the prototype took control of the complex, our soldiers suffered a 40 percent casualty rate.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Only through the actions of the deserter and a group of civilian insurrectionists that
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Our losses were not total. I trust the irony of that is not lost on any of us. Maggie Walsh's vision
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Was brilliant, but ultimately unsupportable.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 The demons cannot be harnessed.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 Cannot be controlled.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 It is therefore our recommendation that this project be terminated and all records concerning it expunged. Our soldiers'll be debriefed. Standard confidentiality clause. We will monitor the civillians and usual measures prepared should they try to go public. I don't think they will.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode21 The Initiative itself will be filled in with concrete. Burn it down, gentlemen. Burn it down, and salt the Earth.
