TROLL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 You seem determined to put an end to all my fun. Just like you always did when we were dating!
buffy_summers You dated a troll?
anya Well, he wasn't a troll then. You know, he was just a big dumb guy.
willow_rosenberg Where is everyone?
anya At the new high school. Buffy's got some kind of job there, Spike's insane in the basement.
buffy_summers Willow?
willow_rosenberg There you are!
buffy_summers We're really glad that you're back.
xander_harris Did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm-monster?
anya Yes.
willow_rosenberg I got the impression that you enjoyedinflicting.
anya Well, causing pain sounds really cool, I know, but turns out it's really upsetting. Didn't use to be.
halfrek It's the talk of the order. They're calling you Miss Softserve.
anya Excuse me?
halfrek No deaths. No eviscerations. You're not goading women into anything inventive, and you're not delivering when it is.
anya It was a glitch, and I am so back in the vengeance fold.
dawn_summers My advice to you is do exactly what everyone else does all the time.
willow_rosenberg Got it.
dawn_summers Do what everyone else does, wear what everyone else wears, say what everyone else says.
willow_rosenberg OK.
dawn_summers People may say something to you you don't understand. Just don't be afraid to keep your mouth shut and pretend like you know what they're saying.
willow_rosenberg You know, Dawn, I've been to college before.
dawn_summers People may say something like My protein window closes in an hour. Just nod and smile. Mm-hmm. Turns out it has something to do with fitness.
buffy_summers Have you talked to her lately?
xander_harris Not since that night with the Gnarl demon. And that wasn't exactly the kind of how have you been kind of talk. More of the pierce its eye with something sharp kind of talking. I'm thinking I should call her.
buffy_summers I just don't want you to get your hopes up.
xander_harris Hopes? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There are no hopes. Anya and I are done. I love being single. I'm a strong, successful male who is giddy at the thought of all the women I will no doubt be dating in the near future.
buffy_summers Strong, successful males say giddy?
xander_harris I just worry about her, that's all.
willow_rosenberg Anya?
xander_harris Yeah, she seems so sad.
dawn_summers She should try acting like everybody else more.
willow_rosenberg Apparently it's what all the kids are doing nowadays.
buffy_summers Well, I'm not sure I get the sad vibe, but there's definitely a vengeance vibe worth worrying about.
xander_harris Oh, that? No, no. I don't worry about that. She was hurt and she just turned back to what she knew when I you know. But that's not her anymore.
buffy_summers I hope you're right.
xander_harris Well, she turned that worm guy back before any real damage happened, right? It'll just take some time. I really think she's coming around.
anya What have I done?
olaf Aud! Sweet, beautiful Aud! I am so hungry, I could eat a small child!
anya Olaf! Are you injured? You smell of blood and musk.
olaf Fear not! It takes more than a band of minor trolls to bring down the mighty Olaf!
anya Trolls!
olaf Oh! They are wretched creatures indeed. The mere thought of them makes me bend at the knee and flex!
anya Sweetheart, please sit down. Allow me to tend to you.
olaf I am fine. Really. I could go for some mead, though.
anya Certainly.
olaf Is it my imagination, or do we have substantially more rabbits in this house today?
anya Oh, they breed so quickly that it's
olaf All this talk of breeding... it makes me want to breed!
anya Honey, of course. But heredrink your mead first.
olaf Ah, yes. Mead.
anya The rapid reproductive rate of our rabbits...has given me an idea. I can give the excess out to the townspeople, exchanging them not for goods or services, but for goodwill and the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly giving of yourself to others.
olaf Ha, ha, ha! Sweet Aud! Your logic is insane and happenstance, like that of a troll. It is no wonder that the bar matrons talk of you.
anya You've been to the bar...
olaf It is not my fault they don't take kindly to you. You speak your mind, and are annoying. It's one of the things I love most about you.
anya Was Rannveig there?
olaf Bah! I've told you a thousand times; I have no interest in this Rannveig. Her hips are large and load bearing, like a Baltic woman. Your hips are narrow, like a Baltic woman from a slightly more arid region. You are my perfect Aud. I could never want for another.
anya I am sorry. I simply love you so much...I feel as though I could burst at times...I could not live without you.
olaf Fear not, sweet Aud, you will always be my beautiful girl.
spike I don't trust what I see anymore. I don't know how to explain it, exactly. It's like I've been seeing things. Dru used to see things, you know? She'd always be staring up at the sky watching cherubs burn or the heavens bleed or some nonsense. I used to stare at her and think she'd gone completely sack of hammers. But she'd see the sky when we were inside and it'd make her so happy. She'd see showers. She'd see stars. Now I see her.
buffy_summers Spike.
spike I'm in trouble, Buffy.
buffy_summers I can help you.
spike I could never ask. Not after...
buffy_summers It's different. You're different.
spike I could never ask.
buffy_summers Spike, it's me. It's you and it's me, and we'll get through this.
spike Never...
buffy_summers We'll get through this.
buffy_summers Spike. This basement is killing you. This is the hellmouth. There is something bad down here, possibly everything bad.
spike Can't hear you. Can't hear you.
buffy_summers You have a soul? Fine. Show me.
spike Scream montresor all you like, pet.
buffy_summers Get up and get out of this basement.
spike I don't have anywhere else to go.
willow_rosenberg And it's not like I've been gone for that long, and I've already done all the reading that I missed. And I can sign up for
professor_hawkins Willow, Willow, it's OK. We'll get you caught up in no time.
willow_rosenberg Really?
professor_hawkins What am I gonna say? No, I don't want my best student back in my class? Well, of course I noticed that drop-off in your grades at mid-term last year, and I was concerned
willow_rosenberg Yeah, that was
professor_hawkins But thenviola. You turned it around and aced all your finals likeboom. Magic.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, similar to, but, um...
professor_hawkins Look, come see me during office hours tomorrow and we'll see about what we need to do to get you caught up, all right?
willow_rosenberg OK. Thanks, professor. Anya! Anya!
anya Willow, hi! What're you doing here?
willow_rosenberg Oh, I'm starting back up at school again! Yeah, I can't believe how great everyone's been. I-I was a little worried, but I already have books and homework and they even said they'd give me periodic surprise quizzes just to make up for the ones that I missed, and... Wh-what're you doing here? Walking out of the fraternity house in the middle of the day?
anya Uh, um... I have a new boyfriend now. He lives here.
willow_rosenberg That's great.
anya Yeah, we just had lots and lots of sex.
willow_rosenberg OK. This is so great. I am so happy to see you've moved on.
anya Yeah, we're tremendously happy together. Now, um, if you'll excuse me, I'm late for something important.
willow_rosenberg Uh, OK. See you later.
willow_rosenberg Hello? Is anybo
YOUNG_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 I take it back. I take it back. I take it back.
willow_rosenberg It's OK. You're OK.
YOUNG_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 I take it back.
willow_rosenberg W-what do you take back?
YOUNG_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 'S gonna be a party. Everyone's gonna be there. Everyone's bringing a date. I'll have a great time. But it was just me. And them. He broke up with me in front of them. I was a game. It was all a game.
willow_rosenberg It's OK. You're OK now.
YOUNG_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 They laughed and they laughed and I cried and they laughed. And I yelled, Just once, I wish you could all feel what it's like to have your hearts ripped out. Just once. I wish... and it came.
willow_rosenberg OK. Come on, what came? What did this?
YOUNG_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 A spider.
willow_rosenberg W-where did it go?
YOUNG_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 What do you mean?
willow_rosenberg The spider. Where is it now?
willow_rosenberg Protect!
willow_rosenberg For God's sake, shut your whimpering mouth!
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry.
VILLAGE_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Troll!
VILLAGE_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 It's the largest troll I've ever seen!
VILLAGE_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Run! Hide your babies and your beadwork!
TROLL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Stop!
TROLL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Stop! It is Olaf!
VILLAGE_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 The troll is doing an Olaf impersonation!
TROLL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 I am Olaf!
VILLAGE_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Hit him with fruits and various meats.
TROLL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Aaarrrrgh!
TROLL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 I am Olaf!
dhoffryn Impressive.
anya Thank you.
dhoffryn What is that? A Woodlow Transmogriphic spell?
anya Thornton's Hope.
dhoffryn Thornton's Hope. But how did you get the troll element?
anya Eelsbane.
dhoffryn Eelsbane. Brilliant! What'd he do?
anya Bar matron. A load bearing bar matron.
dhoffryn Is there any other kind. I'm sorry. How rude of me. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is D'Hoffryn.
anya I am Aud.
dhoffryn Are you? Hmm. I'm afraid you don't see your true self. You are Anyanka. I'm a patron of a family of sorts. We're vengeance demons. I'm sure you've heard of us.
anya No, I'm sorry.
dhoffryn Oh, well, that's quite
anya Oh, no, don't feel bad. I, uh, I don't talk to people much. I mean, I talk to them, but they don't talk to me. Except to say that your questions are irksome, and perhaps you should take your furs and your literal interpretations to the other side of the river.
olaf Come here tiny man. You are small and toy like.
dhoffryn I get the sense that your talents are not fully appreciated here, Anyanka. We'd like you to join us.
anya Why do you keep calling me that? My name is Aud.
dhoffryn Perhaps, but Anyanka is who you are.
anya What would I have to do?
dhoffryn What you do best. Help wronged women punish evil men.
anya Vengeance.
dhoffryn But only to those who deserve it.
anya They all deserve it.
dhoffryn That's where I was going with that, yeah.
buffy_summers Hello. Willow, hey! Is everything A spider demon? Wh h-hold on. A-are you all right? Like how? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wait, OK, go ahead. No, no, no, no, no. It's all good. I'll get Xander to go. But seriously, you just Whoa. Ripped out the heart? My God. Hey, did you get that physics class you wanted?
halfrek This is just wonderful, Anyanka. There's even talk of having some sort of ceremony. I can't tell you how many times today I've heard Anyanka is back to her old self again. Honey, what is it? What's wrong?
anya It's nothing. I just There was just so much screaming, so much blood. I I forgotten how much damage a Grimslaw demon could do.
halfrek Oh, tell me about it. They can be feisty little guys and impossible to house train. I mean, once they start nesting, forget Are you OK? Oh, did something happen?
anya I-I guess I'm just a little rusty. I didn't think it would hit me like this.
halfrek Oh, sweetie. This is perfectly normal. It's a reflex. You'll get over it in no time, trust me.
anya Oh, Hallie! I can't tell you how good it is Thank goodness you're here.
halfrek Oh, sweetie. Of course.
anya It's just lately, with everything that's been going on, I-I've had trouble even remembering
willow_rosenberg Get out.
halfrek Lemon drop, if you think I'm gonna
willow_rosenberg Get out.
anya It's OK.
halfrek Well, OK. If you need anything, you holler.
willow_rosenberg Anya, you have to stop this.
anya Do you know what they did to her? Do you? It was a game. They were humiliating her.
willow_rosenberg Anya, listen to me. You're in trouble. You know it. I'm here to help you.
anya You're here to Well, that's great, Willow. Flayed anybody lately, have you? How quickly they forget!
willow_rosenberg I haven't forgotten one second of it.
anya What do you want?
willow_rosenberg I want to help you.
anya They got what they deserved.
willow_rosenberg No, they
anya I am a vengeance demon! Do you understand that?
willow_rosenberg No.
anya Try! They got what they deserved.
buffy_summers Thanks for side-kicking. I didn't want to trouble Willow. Figure she's got enough to do. First day back and all.
xander_harris Are you kidding? We're doing vent work at the site. Anything's better than breathing freon for eight hours. So, did she say what this thing is?
buffy_summers Some sort of spider demony thingy. She had to go pretty quickly. I think she had to sign up for classes or something.
xander_harris Ah, yes, there is little that can distract the Willow when she's on the hunt for the mighty syllabi.
buffy_summers I don't know. I guess she was a little more nervous than she was letting on.
xander_harris How big did she say this thing was?
buffy_summers She didn't. But I can't imagine she'd send us out if it wasn't The heart is completely ripped out. This is our guy.
xander_harris Or a copycat spider demon. So what's this black stuff?
xander_harris Aw, it's sticky!
buffy_summers Willow said it was a spider demon. Maybe it's its webbing.
xander_harris This isn't springy high-flying fun.
buffy_summers Xander.
xander_harris Is that it?
buffy_summers I can't tell. There is definitely something moving up there.
xander_harris Maybe we can somehow lure it.
buffy_summers Xander!
buffy_summers You OK?
xander_harris Buffy, where'd it go? I think we need more swords.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
xander_harris I say we go home, pick up more swords, and some sort of spidery demon protection amulet. We come back, and
xander_harris Or
buffy_summers I'm more concerned with where that thing came from. If there are more of those spider demons running around, we need to know about it. We should hit the research, find out if
willow_rosenberg I know where it came from.
buffy_summers How many?
willow_rosenberg Ten, twelve.
xander_harris When were you planning on telling us?
willow_rosenberg I'm telling you now.
xander_harris Great. Thank you. Willow, it's Anya. How could you let us How could you not have told us?
buffy_summers Xander...
xander_harris How could you not have told me?
buffy_summers Xander. It's OK. She didn't tell us for a reason. She didn't tell us because she knows what I have to do. I have to kill Anya.
halfrek I swear, I'm in awe of you.
anya Oh, stop.
halfrek Oh, I will not.
anya I grant wishes. It's all inside the girl. I just bring it out.
halfrek Yes, I'm sure this is what she had in mind.
anya Well, I don't know about her mind, but it was in her heart. Besides, Russia was ready to explode. All we did is just give it a little push.
halfrek What should we do with the rest of our evening? I hear they're going to raze the Winter Mansion.
anya Well, I thought we'd head on down to Madame Dubasov's. No better spot for vengeance than a brothel.
halfrek Oh, it's always work, work, work with you.
anya Well, of course. What else is there?
halfrek What else is there? Why, the whole world, for one. Darling, take a look around. There's a lot to see. There's a revolution going on outside that you are somewhat responsible for. Aren't you the teeniest bit interested?
anya Well, what is there to be interested in? The worker will overthrow absolutism and lead the proletariat to a victorious communist revolution, resulting in socio-economic paradise on earth. It's common sense, really. I have better things to worry about.
halfrek But, Anyanka, there's a whole world out there.
anya Yes, filled with wronged women who need my help.
halfrek Oh, but you're talking work.
anya I'm talking about life. Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek. I don't need anything else. Vengeance is what I am.
buffy_summers She's not the Anya that you knew, Xander. She's a demon.
xander_harris That doesn't mean you have to kill her.
buffy_summers Don't act like this is easy for me. You know it's not.
xander_harris There are other options.
buffy_summers I've considered them.
xander_harris When? Just now? Took you all of ten seconds to decide to kill one of your best friends?
buffy_summers The thought that it might come to this has occurred to me before. It's occurred to you, too.
xander_harris But we can change what she did. Fix it. These are mystical deaths, right? There has to be something.
willow_rosenberg I don't have anywhere near that kind of power. I didn't have that kind of power when And I-I don't think I trust the power I do have.
buffy_summers It's OK. Xander, I know this is hard for you to hear, but it's what I have to do.
xander_harris Hard for me to hear? Buffy, you wanna kill Anya!
buffy_summers I don't want to.
xander_harris Then don't! This isn't new ground for us. When our friends go all crazy and start killing people, we help them.
willow_rosenberg Sitting right here.
xander_harris I'm sorry. But it's true.
buffy_summers It's different.
xander_harris Because you don't care about her the same way I do. Buffy, I still love her.
buffy_summers I know. And that's why you can't see this for what it really is. Willow was different. She's a human. Anya's a demon.
xander_harris And you're the slayer. I see now how it's all very simple.
buffy_summers It is never simple.
xander_harris No, of course not. You know, if there's a mass-murdering demon that you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all gray area.
buffy_summers Spike was harmless. He was helping.
xander_harris He had no choice.
buffy_summers And Anya did! She chose to become a demon. Twice.
xander_harris You have no idea what she's going through.
buffy_summers I don't care what she's going through!
xander_harris No, of course not. You think we haven't seen all this before? The part where you just cut us all out. Just step away from everything human and act like you're the law. If you knew what I felt
buffy_summers I killed Angel! Do you even remember that? I would have given up everything I had to be with I loved him more than I will ever love anything in this life. And I put a sword through his heart because I had to.
willow_rosenberg And that all worked out OK.
buffy_summers Do you remember cheering me on? Both of you. Do you remember giving me Willow's message: Kick his ass.
willow_rosenberg I never said that
xander_harris This is different
buffy_summers It is always different! It's always complicated. And at some point, someone has to draw the line, and that is always going to be me. You get down on me for cutting myself off, but in the end the slayer is always cut off. There's no mystical guidebook. No all-knowing council. Human rules don't apply. There's only me. I am the law.
xander_harris There has to be another way.
buffy_summers Then please find it.
willow_rosenberg I can't. I'm sorry.
dhoffryn Behold, D'Hoffryn. Lord of Arashmahar. He that turns the air to blood and rains Miss Rosenberg. How lovely to see you again. Have you done something with your hair?
willow_rosenberg Hello, D'Hoffryn.
dhoffryn I figured I'd be hearing from you soon. The flaying of Warren Meers? Oh, truly inspired. That was water cooler vengeance. Lloyd has a sketch of it on his wall.
willow_rosenberg That's not me anymore.
dhoffryn Is that right? So, I didn't feel your presence earlier today? I didn't feel a bit of the old you?
willow_rosenberg We need to talk about Anya.
dhoffryn Very well. Let's talk about Anyanka.
xander_harris I thought I might find you here. Have you forced yourself to look at the bodies yet?
anya What do you want?
xander_harris I want to help you.
anya Everyone is so considerate today. I should've slaughtered people weeks ago.
xander_harris I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. Everything I put you through.
anya Thank you. All better. Thank goodness you got here in time.
xander_harris You don't understand. This isn't an intervention. Buffy's coming to kill you.
anya She's coming to try.
xander_harris Did everybody have their crazy flakes today? You guys are friends. How could you talk like this?
anya I have a job to do. And so does Buffy. Xander, you've always seen what you wanted to. But you knew, sooner or later, it would come to this.
xander_harris Buffy, get out of here.
buffy_summers Get out of my way, Xander.
xander_harris No.
anya Get out of her way, Xander.
anya This is getting to be a pattern with you, Buffy. Are there any friends of your left you haven't tried to kill? C'mon, Buffy. Don't you have a clever retort for me?
buffy_summers Anya, I'm sorry.
anya You're apologizing to me. What fight are you watching? Or is this like one of your little pop-culture references I don't get, 'cause I'm a vengeance
xander_harris I just want... happy... ending...
anya Honey? Honey?
xander_harris What? I'm awake. I'm OK.
anya Honey? Was that weird? That thing earlier with the singing... and the coconuts.
xander_harris What? No, it's fine.
NEIGHBOR_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Oh, no. Mustard on my shirt.
NEIGHBOR_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Mustard. I'll never get it out.
NEIGHBOR_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 My favorite red shirt.
NEIGHBOR_WOMAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Dry clean it.
NEIGHBOR_MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 How could you serve
NEIGHBORS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season07.Episode05 Mustard.
anya Are you still hungry? Because I'd be
anya Mr. Xander Harris.
anya That's what he is to the world outside.
anya That's the name he carries with pride.
anya I'm just lately Anya.
anya Not very much to the world, I know.
anya All these years with nothing to show.
anya I've boned a troll, I've wreaked some wrath,
anya But on the whole, I've had no path.
anya I like to bowl, I'm good with math,
anya But who am I?
anya Now I reply that
anya I'm the Missis
anya I will be his Missis.
anya Mrs. Anya Christina Emanuella Jenkins Harris.
anya What's the point of loving...
anya I mean except for the sweaty part.
anya What's the point of losing your heart?
anya Maybe if you're lucky
anya Being a pair makes you twice as tall.
anya Maybe you're not losing at all.
anya No need to cover up my heart,
anya Plus see above RE: sweaty part.
anya So maybe love is pretty smart
anya And so am I
anya I found my guy!
anya And I'll be Missis
anya I will be his Missis
anya Mrs. Anya Lame-Ass-Made-Up-Maiden-Name Harris.
anya We'll never part
anya Not if we can
anya And if we start
anya Then here's my plan
anya I'll show him what bliss is
anya Welcome him with kisses
anya 'Cause this is a Missis who misses her man
anya He's my Xander
anya And he's awfully swell
anya It makes financial sense as well,
anya Although he can beI'll never tell
anya Just stand aside
anya Here comes the bride
anya I'll be Missis.
anya I will be his Missis
anya I will be
xander_harris Anya!
anya Forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt. Aaahh! You know better than that, Buffy. It takes a lot more to kill a vengeance demon.
buffy_summers Oh, I'm just getting started.
anya Stop trying to save me, Xander!
dhoffryn Oh, please, don't mind me. Continue with whatever it was you were doing. Oh, breathtaking. It's like somebody slaughtered an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. Easy now. I'd be gone before you could swing. Isn't that just like a slayer. Solving all her problems by sticking things with sharp objects. I talked to your friend, Miss Rosenberg. She's a firebrand. I have high hopes for her.
xander_harris Stay away from Willow.
dhoffryn Oh, he's gallant, isn't he. I understand what you saw in him. Look, Miss Rosenberg seems to think Anyanka would be better suited outside the vengeance fold. I think we already know what Lady HacksAway wants. And the young man, he sees with the eyeballs of love. But I'm not sure if anyone's bothered to find out what Anyanka herself really wants.
xander_harris Her name is Anya.
dhoffryn Actually, funny historical side-bar, her original name was
anya I wanna take it back.
dhoffryn I'm sorry. What was that?
anya I wanna take it back. I wanna undo what I did.
dhoffryn Hmm. You want to take it back. Must be twelve bodies in there. Such a thingnot easily done. But not impossible. You're a big girl, Anyanka. You understand how this works. The proverbial scales must balance. In order to restore the lives of the victims, the fates require a sacrifice. The life and soul of a vengeance demon.
anya Do it.
xander_harris Wait!
anya Stay out of this Xander.
xander_harris OK, all right. That seems smart. He just said you have to die! Perhaps there's some sort of alternate price.
anya Xander, you can't help me. I'm not even sure there's a me to help. I understand the price. Do it.
dhoffryn You're sure? This is your wish?
anya This is my wish. Undo what I did.
dhoffryn Very well.
xander_harris No!
halfrek Anya!
anya Hallie!
dhoffryn Who did you think you were dealing with? Did you think it would be that easy to get away?
anya Why?
dhoffryn Why? Because you wished it!
anya But she was yours.
dhoffryn Like you were mine? Haven't I taught you anything, Anya? Never go for the kill when you can go for the pain. Hold him back, Slayer. Wouldn't want anyone to get hurt. I've got plenty of girls. There will always be vengeance demons. But now you, Anya, you're out. Congratulations. You're wish is granted.
anya You should've killed me.
dhoffryn Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. From beneath you, it devours. Be patient. All good things in time.
buffy_summers Go. I'll check on the boys.
xander_harris Anya, wait.
anya Xander, please. Just go away.
xander_harris Whatever's between usit doesn't matter. You shouldn't be alone in this.
anya Yes, I should. My whole life, I've just clung to whatever came along.
xander_harris Well, speaking as a clingee I kinda didn't mind.
anya Thanks. For everything.
anya Xander what if I'm really nobody?
xander_harris Don't be a dope.
anya I'm a dope?
xander_harris Sometimes.
anya That's a start.
