spike I love you.
buffy_summers The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
dawn_summers Buffy, no.
dawn_summers No!
xander_harris You're talking about raising the dead. It feels wrong.
tara_maclay It is wrong.
willow_rosenberg She could be trapped!
willow_rosenberg I'm not gonna leave her there.
willow_rosenberg Osiris, master of all fate, let her cross over.
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
anya What's wrong with her?
willow_rosenberg She's in shock.
dawn_summers Who are they?
spike Road pirates. They raid towns, use 'em up, burn 'em down.
dawn_summers You're alive, and you're home. You're home.
willow_rosenberg She's at home. She has to be. We're, we just need to get there, and she'll be there.
tara_maclay This is the fastest way?
xander_harris Absolutely.
tara_maclay You sure?
xander_harris Hey, I've done a lot of fleeing on these mean streets. I know all the shortcuts.
anya I don't like this. Look, fire. Fire is rarely a sign of imminent safety.
willow_rosenberg I wish we were there already.
xander_harris Hey, hey, don't worry, ladies, I'll get us there just fine. My senses are primed for danger, and nothing's gonna-
xander_harris I'm okay. Four. Four limbs.
anya Well, at least the demons almost hit you on the way *out* of town.
xander_harris Yeah, now that their leader's gone they seem to be making with the big skedaddle.
willow_rosenberg I-it was Buffy, right? We, we saw her and it was really Buffy?
anya I think we screwed it up. She's broken.
willow_rosenberg No! She's not broken! She's just .... disoriented from being ... tormented in some hell dimension. Probably tortured and ... It's like, we don't even know how much time has passed there for her, uh, possibly years. That's not something you just get over. Oh my God. What if she never gets over it?
anya And you think of this now?
tara_maclay What are you thinking, Willow? That-that she's ... that she's not right, or, or maybe like, dangerous?
dawn_summers Home! See?
dawn_summers You're back home. We're all okay now.
buffy_summers Ow.
buffy_summers It's different.
dawn_summers A little. Uh, Willow and Tara live here now, and, uh, we ...
dawn_summers ...we didn't do much...
dawn_summers We moved some of the chairs, and took out some of the little tables, but...
dawn_summers This is the same. Except the computer stuff.
dawn_summers That's Willow's, obviously. We eat at the other end...
dawn_summers Obviously.
dawn_summers There you are. Knew you were under that dirt somewhere.
dawn_summers You remember what Mom used to say? Either wash that neck or plant potatoes. Yeah, I never thought it was funny either.
dawn_summers You want to button that, or, um...
dawn_summers Ohh ... ow.
dawn_summers Um, we'll ... take care of that after.
buffy_summers Okay.
dawn_summers Here, I'll do the shirt. And then, then we'll do your hands.
dawn_summers See how nice you look...
dawn_summers Mom's room. I know it's really different now.
buffy_summers Willow and Tara. This is their room.
dawn_summers Yeah, well, it seemed to make the most sense. No one was using it, and it's the biggest. But, you know, now that you're here, we'll have to figure out something to do.
dawn_summers Buffy? You wanna, like, stop? We can ... we can sit down and talk.
buffy_summers What else is different?
dawn_summers Do you mean about the house, or...
dawn_summers Um. Let's see ... Giles. It's so weird. He, he left today. Because you were ... He, he'll come right back, I'll call him. Someone'll call him.
buffy_summers What...
dawn_summers What what?
buffy_summers Uh ... What, um ... will you say to him?
buffy_summers What's that?
dawn_summers It's okay. It's okay.
spike Dawn! Dawn! Are you there?
dawn_summers It, it's just Spike. I'm here!
spike Thank God. You scared me half to death ... or more to death. You - I could kill you.
dawn_summers Spike.
spike I mean it. I could rip your head off one-handed and drink from your brain stem.
dawn_summers Look.
spike Yeah? I've seen the bloody bot before. Didn't think she'd patch up so-
dawn_summers She's kind of, um ... She's been through a lot ... with the ... death. But I think she's okay.
dawn_summers Spike? Are *you* okay?
spike I'm ... what did you do?
dawn_summers Me? Nothing.
spike Her hands.
dawn_summers Um, I was gonna fix 'em. I don't know how they got like that.
spike I do. Clawed her way out of a coffin, that's how. Isn't that right?
buffy_summers Yeah. That's ... what I had to do.
spike Done it myself.
spike Um ... We'll take care of you. Come here.
spike Get some stuff, uh, mercurochrome, bandages.
dawn_summers Okay.
buffy_summers How long was I gone?
spike Hundred forty-seven days yesterday. Uh ... hundred forty-eight today. 'Cept today doesn't count, does it?
spike How long was it for you ... where you were?
buffy_summers Longer.
dawn_summers Got the stuff.
willow_rosenberg Is she here?
anya She's here!
willow_rosenberg You're here.
xander_harris We didn't know where you were.
anya You ran away.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
tara_maclay Are you okay?
dawn_summers You knew she was back?
dawn_summers How did you know?
anya You're not a zombie, are you?
xander_harris Anya!
willow_rosenberg Are you in pain?
xander_harris What do you remember?
tara_maclay What do you know about what happened?
dawn_summers Hey! Back off!
dawn_summers You did this. What did you do?
willow_rosenberg A spell. We, we did a spell.
anya We didn't think it worked, but-
dawn_summers Is she going to be okay?
buffy_summers I'm okay.
buffy_summers I'm gonna be fine. I remember. You brought me back.
anya What was it like?
buffy_summers I, I can't...
xander_harris It's okay. You don't have to talk about this, Buff. Hey, do you want something? Anything. Pizza. I'll get you pizza.
anya Buffy likes pizza.
tara_maclay Yeah, something to eat-
willow_rosenberg She doesn't want pizza.
tara_maclay I just meant-
dawn_summers Guys! Back off.
willow_rosenberg Right, uh, Dawn's right. We should just be quiet, and let Buffy tell us what she needs.
buffy_summers I, I think I ... just wanna go to sleep.
tara_maclay That's a good idea. You, you should sleep.
willow_rosenberg Right. Long day. But, Buffy ... be happy. We got you out. We really did it.
buffy_summers Tired.
anya Well, yeah. I mean ... jet-lag from hell has gotta be, you know, jet-lag from hell.
buffy_summers My room is still...
dawn_summers Yeah. Yes. It's your room.
willow_rosenberg Well, she, she's fine! Normal! She used to go to bed all the time!
anya I think Willow's wrong. I don't think she's particularly normal at all.
xander_harris Well, she just got back. Give it time. I bet in a week she'll be our little Bufferin again.
anya Oh yes, cause six or seven days, that's all you really need to get over eternal hell experiences.
xander_harris Who's that? Spike?
xander_harris What are you doing out here? I hope you're not going to start your little obsession now that she's around again.
anya Hey!
spike You didn't tell me. You brought her back and you didn't tell me.
xander_harris Well, now you know.
spike I worked beside you all summer.
xander_harris We didn't tell you. It was just ... we didn't, okay?
spike Listen. I've figured it out.
spike Maybe you haven't, but I have.
spike Willow knew there was a chance that she'd come back wrong. So wrong that you'd have ... that she would have to get rid of what came back. And I wouldn't let her. If any part of that was Buffy, I wouldn't let her. And that's why she shut me out.
xander_harris What are you talking about? Willow wouldn't do that.
spike Oh. Is that right.
xander_harris Look. You're just covering. Don't tell me you're not happy. Look me in the eyes, and tell me when you saw Buffy alive, that wasn't the happiest moment of your entire existence.
spike That's the thing about magic. There's always consequences.
spike Always!
willow_rosenberg Hey.
tara_maclay Did you get through to London?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. He's gonna head back as soon as he can. I'm not sure, like maybe a couple days.
tara_maclay How did he take it?
willow_rosenberg Um ... I'm not sure. I mean ... glad, but ... kinda weirded out, which I get, you know? Lots of dear lords. And I think I actually heard him cleaning his glasses.
tara_maclay Are you worried?
willow_rosenberg Worried? Tara, it worked fine. It's all good.
tara_maclay Hey, Will, this is me. It doesn't all have to be good and fine. This is the room where you don't have to be brave. I still love you. If you're worried you can be worried.
willow_rosenberg Well ... I'm not ... unworried. I mean, what, what happened, that was intense. That's ... gotta change you.
willow_rosenberg When Angel came back ... Buffy said ... he was wild. Like an animal.
tara_maclay Buffy's not like that.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
tara_maclay But?
willow_rosenberg It's just kinda ... noisy up here tonight, you know?
tara_maclay Yeah.
tara_maclay Is this better?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. I think it makes things quieter in here.
tara_maclay You know what I think? I think we all just assumed crash positions.
willow_rosenberg Huh?
tara_maclay It's, it's, it's like ... we were all tensed up, like ... we were expecting it to screw up. We weren't prepared for it to ... actually go right.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
willow_rosenberg Tara?
tara_maclay Yeah?
willow_rosenberg If things did go right ... wouldn't you think she'd be ... happier? Like, wouldn't you think she would be so happy that we brought her out?
tara_maclay Sure she is.
tara_maclay You thought she'd say thanks. Be more grateful.
willow_rosenberg Would I be a terrible person if I said yes?
tara_maclay Give her time. She'll get there.
willow_rosenberg Right. No need to be in a big furry hurry.
tara_maclay Exactly.
tara_maclay I'm sure it's okay.
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
buffy_summers What did you do? Do you know what you did? You're like children. Your hands smell of death. Bitches! Filthy little bitches, rattling the bones. Did you cut the throat? Did you pat its head?
buffy_summers The blood dried on your hands, didn't it?
tara_maclay Oh my god, oh my god.
buffy_summers You were stained. You still are. I know what you did!
tara_maclay The glass. There's no glass.
willow_rosenberg Okay, what in the frilly heck is going on?
tara_maclay Maybe we dreamed it.
willow_rosenberg Right. Right. Wrong! Different brains.
tara_maclay Oh yeah.
tara_maclay Well ... what was it talking about? Did you understand it?
willow_rosenberg Well, I understood the words, but ... no.
willow_rosenberg What was that?
tara_maclay There's, there's something in the house.
willow_rosenberg What is it after? Is it ... Buffy?
tara_maclay I don't know.
willow_rosenberg That's it, I'm gonna call. I hope Xander's up.
anya Xander, are you up? I can't sleep. Play a word game with me.
anya Xander, are you awake? Okay, I'm going to describe an adjective with accurate but misleading clues, and then you have to guess what it is. Xander? Xander?
xander_harris Huh? What? Do what?
anya That oughta do it.
xander_harris Hello?
willow_rosenberg Xander, it's me, Willow. We were just attacked.
xander_harris Attacked? A vampire?
willow_rosenberg No, it was Buffy. Or something that looked like her.
tara_maclay Like she was possessed.
willow_rosenberg And then she just disappeared, a-and, and we saw something... a little ... there's something in the house.
xander_harris In the house? All right, Willow, you need to get out of there, just get everyone out.
xander_harris Wake up Buffy and Dawn. Don't make a big deal-
xander_harris Gah!
xander_harris Anya!
xander_harris Anya!
willow_rosenberg Xander? Xander!
xander_harris Very bad. Very, very, very bad. Bad.
anya He's all traumatized.
willow_rosenberg Well, whatever it is, it's not the, the traditional haunting, because i-it's not limited to one specific place, and there's not, you know, a dead person.
tara_maclay Not any more.
anya I bet it's a hitchhiker.
xander_harris A hitchhiker?
anya Um, standard way to travel through dimensions. Uh, some demon-thing sees someone moving between worlds, and grabs on for the ride.
willow_rosenberg You mean like, some hell-beastie rode in with Buffy? Like ... we're responsible for this?
tara_maclay Assume crash positions.
anya I think we shouldn't've brought Buffy back. I knew it was going to end badly. I should've said something.
xander_harris Okay, fine, but ... what are we gonna do? I mean, I'm feeling the need for some vigorous doing, you know?
willow_rosenberg It's okay. We, we just kill the beastie and then all is good. We're rolling in puppies! ... Right?
xander_harris Can we do that? Kill it?
buffy_summers We killing something?
willow_rosenberg Buffy! You're not supposed to be up.
tara_maclay How, how are you feeling? Are you okay?
buffy_summers So what are we killing?
anya A demon you brought back from Hell with you.
buffy_summers Oh.
willow_rosenberg It's not like she's making it sound. A little haunting-type stuff. Boo-scary, everything's normal.
tara_maclay You shouldn't worry about it.
buffy_summers Um, I remember something, last ... night, uh...
xander_harris Buff?
buffy_summers Um ... the photographs. O-of us. They changed.
tara_maclay How did they change?
buffy_summers They were ... dead. I-I-I mean, we were dead. Like, um ... dead bodies? But, but then they were okay. So I just, you know, figured it was me. That I was going crazy.
anya Well, maybe you are. Going crazy. From Hell.
anya No. You're fine.
willow_rosenberg You are. And Buffy, we're, we're so glad.
xander_harris Yeah. This thing, this haunting thing, we'll fix it, and then we'll still have you back, which is ... it's so important.
willow_rosenberg Yes.
tara_maclay It's wonderful.
buffy_summers We should get to work.
dawn_summers What's the list?
anya Possible hitchhikers.
xander_harris Demons that might have come out of Hell at the same time Buffy did.
dawn_summers Skaggmore demons, Trellbane demons, Skitterers, Large and Small Bone-Eaters ... If we get to pick, I say we go with the Small Bone-Eaters.
anya Well, that just means they prefer to eat things with small bones, like you.
willow_rosenberg That's just what we have so far. Five species of demons that have been known to move transdimensionally. Two of them may be invisible in this dimension, and, uh, two others can perform spells to alter perception.
anya Well, that's four. What's the other one like?
tara_maclay Uh, like the others, only dripping with viscous fluid.
dawn_summers Eww.
xander_harris So, should we concentrate on how to kill those, or should we try to find more?
willow_rosenberg I'm not sure. Maybe ... maybe some of us can, uh, keep going finding more, and the others
buffy_summers I miss Giles.
willow_rosenberg Oh. He's coming back, I talked to him. I know I'm a kind of poor substitute, but until then, we'll get it done.
buffy_summers I think I should patrol.
willow_rosenberg Well, I know we'll find something soon.
buffy_summers Yeah.
xander_harris Uh, do you want us to go with you?
anya We can do that.
buffy_summers No. I-I need to go. Sorry.
dawn_summers You should go.
dawn_summers I'll be safe here with the others. Don't worry about me.
anya I found one of those 24-hour places for coffee. Remember that bookstore? Well they became one of those books-and-coffee places, and now they're just coffee. It's like evolution, only without the getting-better part.
anya Uh, coffee, coffee, coffee, um, hot chocolate for Dawn. You're too young for coffee.
dawn_summers Idiot.
anya You can have my coffee.
dawn_summers All of you did it. You stupid children. Did you think the blood wouldn't reach you? I smell the death on you. Look at what you've done!
xander_harris Fire! Fire! Fire!
tara_maclay Dawn!
willow_rosenberg Oh my god, oh my god.
willow_rosenberg That was it. Li-like Buffy, with fire.
xander_harris Is she okay?
anya Did I look like that? I hope I didn't look like that.
willow_rosenberg No, I'm sure you looked really glamorous cutting up your face.
dawn_summers What ... what is it? What's happening?
willow_rosenberg You'll be okay.
anya I bet you'll experience some dry-mouth. Fire.
dawn_summers Was it ... did the demon thing have me?
tara_maclay It's okay. It's okay.
xander_harris Yeah. It's gone.
anya Yes, but where did it go? I mean, evil things have plans. They have things to do.
spike Buffy.
spike You should be careful. Never know what kind of villain's got a knife at your back.
buffy_summers Your hand is hurt.
spike Hmm. Same with you.
buffy_summers Right.
spike Willow's getting pretty strong, isn't she? Bringing you back. It's hard to get a good night's death around here.
spike You can sit down. Got furniture.
spike You should see the downstairs, too, it's quite posh.
spike Uh ... I do remember what I said. The promise. To protect her. If I had done that ... even if I didn't make it ... you wouldn't have had to jump.
spike But I want you to know I did save you. Not when it counted, of course, but ... after that. Every night after that. I'd see it all again ... do something different. Faster or more clever, you know? Dozens of times, lots of different ways ... Every night I save you.
xander_harris It's getting light out. Buffy's probably on her way home from patrolling.
tara_maclay I like sunrise better when I'm getting up early than when I'm staying up late, you know? It's like ... I'm seeing it from the wrong side.
xander_harris Hey, Tara, this is probably crazy ... but Spike got me to thinking. This spell we did ... it's having consequences, isn't it? I mean ... it sure seems like it. And I was just wondering ... did you know that this might happen?
tara_maclay No!
xander_harris Do you think ... could someone have known?
tara_maclay Willow is a talented witch, and she would never do anything to hurt anyone.
xander_harris I know, I know, huh? Backing off quickly, hands in the air. I just meant-
willow_rosenberg Thaumogenesis!
anya She's possessed!
willow_rosenberg Thaumogenesis.
dawn_summers You're right.
willow_rosenberg I'm not possessed. I-I think I figured it out. This demon, i-it's not a demon we let out. It's, it's a demon that we made.
xander_harris We made a demon? Bad us.
willow_rosenberg Thaumogenesis is when doing a spell actually creates a being. In this case it was like, a, a side-effect, I guess. Like a price.
dawn_summers What?
willow_rosenberg Think of it like, the world doesn't like you getting something for free, and we asked for this huge gift. Buffy. A-and so the world said, 'fine, but if you have that, you have to take this too.' And it made the demon.
anya Well, technically, that's not a price. That's a gift with purchase.
dawn_summers Um, but, if we made the demon, how come we can't see it? I mean, all we see is us. Doing stuff.
willow_rosenberg Well, I, I think it's out of phase with this dimension. Like, its consciousness is here, but, but its body is caught in the ether between existing and not existing.
tara_maclay It doesn't have a body, so it's borrowing ours. I-it borrowed Dawn and Anya...
willow_rosenberg Or, or it's manifesting copies of them, like, like it did when Buffy came at us...
tara_maclay It's using them to do stuff. To scare us, attack us.
xander_harris So we need to uncreate it, right? We need to send it the rest of the way out of our world.
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh. Except that ... it's linked to the spell. So, if we sent it away ... it would be like the spell doesn't exist. Like it never happened.
dawn_summers Like it never brought Buffy back.
willow_rosenberg Yes.
dawn_summers You can't do that. You can't think for a second that you're going to do that.
tara_maclay Dawn-
dawn_summers If you think you can give her back to me and then take her away again? No. That's worse than if you'd never brought her back. You can't mess with people's lives this way!
willow_rosenberg Dawn, we're not going to do it that way.
dawn_summers How can you let her do this? How can you even talk about letting her go?
tara_maclay Honey, you're not listening. She said we will find another way.
xander_harris We will.
dawn_summers Then do it!
willow_rosenberg Wait. Wait. Dawn. Everybody hold on.
anya What? Why are you smiling? That's inappropriate.
willow_rosenberg Because it's temporary.
xander_harris What is?
willow_rosenberg The demon. I-it's gonna dissipate. The only way for it to survive on this plane is if it were to kill the subject of the original spell.
tara_maclay It would live if it killed Buffy?
willow_rosenberg That's not gonna-
xander_harris Thanks for the tip.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode03 You don't belong here.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode03 Did they tell you, you belonged here?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode03 Did they say this was your home again?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode03 Were you offered pretty lies, little girl?
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode03 Or did they even give you a choice?
dawn_summers Xander! Drive faster!
xander_harris I can't!
dawn_summers I could drive faster and I can't drive!
anya She's right, you're like a snail. A snail who's driving a car very slowly. Come on, give it the lead foot! We've got to help Buffy with that demon you sent after her!
xander_harris I did not send the demon, I was possessed. The demon used me to eavesdrop on our conversation.
anya Great, so now what? We have to talk in some sort of anti-demon secret code?
xander_harris Ood-gay idea-yay, An-yay.
dawn_summers Stop talking wrong in Pig Latin and drive! Buffy's in trouble!
xander_harris It's okay, Dawnie. Willow and Tara are doing a spell.
dawn_summers You sure it won't send Buffy back?
xander_harris No, of course not. It's just that she can't fight this thing if it's all ... misty, so they make it more solid, so Buffy can kick its fully embodied ass.
dawn_summers You sure it'll work?
willow_rosenberg@tara_maclay Child of words, hear thy makers. Child of words, we entreat. With our actions did we make thee, to our voices wilt thou bend.
willow_rosenberg@tara_maclay With our potions thou took motive, with our motions came to pass. We rescind no past devotions, give thee substance, give thee mass.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode03 You're the one who's barely here. Set on this earth like a bubble.
DEMON#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode03 You won't even disturb the air when you go.
buffy_summers Go! Take Dawn out of here!
tara_maclay Child of words, hear thy makers. Child of words, we en...treat...
willow_rosenberg Solid.
dawn_summers That's probably the sort of thing I'm not supposed to see, right?
buffy_summers Dawn!
dawn_summers What's wrong?
buffy_summers Lunch.
dawn_summers You made me lunch? Wow. Thanks.
buffy_summers You better go. You've been out since ... I got back. And you know what they say. Those of us who fail history? Doomed to repeat it in summer school.
dawn_summers Thank you.
dawn_summers Are you okay?
buffy_summers I'm going to start charging money for every person that asks me that.
dawn_summers Everyone's been doing that, huh?
buffy_summers A little bit.
dawn_summers It's because they care about you a lot. When you were gone ... it was bad when you were gone. But it'll be better now. Now that they can see you being happy. That's all they want.
willow_rosenberg Buffy! Hey!
xander_harris Hey, you get Dawn off to school all right? 'Cause I was thinking, if you need help picking her up, I...
buffy_summers It's okay. I got it. Look, you guys, um, there's this thing ... so I'm just gonna say it.
buffy_summers You brought me back. I was in a ... I was in hell. I, um ... I can't think too much about what it was like. But it felt like the world abandoned me there. And then suddenly ... you guys did what you did.
tara_maclay It was Willow. She knew what to do.
buffy_summers Okay. So you did that. And the world came rushing back. Thank you. You guys gave me the world. I can't tell you what it means to me.
buffy_summers And I should have said it before.
willow_rosenberg You're welcome.
xander_harris Welcome home, Buffy.
spike Buffy.
buffy_summers Spike, it's daylight and you're-
spike Not on fire? Sun's low enough, shady enough here.
spike I was gonna go inside, but I overheard you and the Super-friends exchanging a special moment and I came over a bit queasy.
spike Say, aren't you leaving a hole in the middle of some soggy group hug?
buffy_summers Just wanted a little time alone.
spike Oh, uh, right then.
buffy_summers That's okay. I can be alone with you here.
spike Thanks ever so.
buffy_summers Right.
spike Buff? ... Slayer? Are you okay?
buffy_summers I'm here. I'm good.
spike Buffy, if you're in ... if you're in pain ... or if you need anything... or if I can do anything for you...
buffy_summers You can't.
spike Well, I haven't been to a hell dimension just of late, but I do know a thing or two about torment.
buffy_summers I was happy.
buffy_summers Wherever I ... was ... I was happy. At peace.
buffy_summers I knew that everyone I cared about was all right. I knew it. Time ... didn't mean anything ... nothing had form ... but I was still me, you know? And I was warm ... and I was loved ... and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about theology or dimensions, or ... any of it, really ... but I think I was in heaven.
buffy_summers And now I'm not. I was torn out of there. Pulled out ... by my friends. Everything here is ... hard, and bright, and violent. Everything I feel, everything I touch ... this is Hell. Just getting through the next moment, and the one after that ... knowing what I've lost...
buffy_summers They can never know. Never.
