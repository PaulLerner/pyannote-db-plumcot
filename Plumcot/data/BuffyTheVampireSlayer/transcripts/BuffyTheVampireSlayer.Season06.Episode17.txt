andrew_wells Oh man, your face was priceless.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, real funny.
warren_meers It serves you right for taking Z's on lookout again.
jonathan_levinson What do you expect? I haven't had a decent night's sleep since... I mean, I'm going Jack Torrence in here, you know? Stuck in this basement for weeks! I mean, we rented the whole house, can't we at least sleep upstairs?
andrew_wells We're on the lam. We have to lay low. Underground?
jonathan_levinson It's figurative, doofus! Did you even read
warren_meers Okay, enough! Midgetor, get back to the monitors. The last thing we need is to be surprised by-
andrew_wells Holy Geez Louise.
jonathan_levinson The-the-
warren_meers The frickin' Slayer.
jonathan_levinson She's right there!
warren_meers All right, don't panic. Andrew ... deploy your little friend.
buffy_summers Oh. Hi.
buffy_summers You didn't by chance happen to just eat a couple of nerds, did you?
MAN_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode17 You're gonna hurt yourself!
MAN_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode17 She's gonna break the needle. We're gonna have to strap her down.
willow_rosenberg Hi, um, Tara, how are you?
willow_rosenberg W-well, I-I was wondering, maybe, you would wanna go out sometime? For coffee ... food ... kisses and gay love? Hi Tara. Guess what? Magic-free now for, insert number, days now.
lorraine_ross Buffy.
lorraine_ross Buffy.
FEMALE_DOCTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode17 Come on, it's time for your drugs.
buffy_summers What?
lorraine_ross I said, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you were on drugs.
buffy_summers Okay. Good.
buffy_summers Whatcha doin'?
willow_rosenberg I'm online, checking to see if Xander emailed.
buffy_summers Any luck?
willow_rosenberg No such.
buffy_summers Well, maybe Anya found him and they're trying to work it out. How come you're all, home, hearth, and DSL anyway? I thought you were gonna go see Tara.
willow_rosenberg Saw her. Saw her completely.
buffy_summers Ouch. Just got a scratch from all that brittle.
willow_rosenberg It's... ...when I was seeing her, she was seeing someone else. A girl.
buffy_summers You mean-
willow_rosenberg I mean ... not seeing seeing. Well, maybe. I don't know, it was inconclusive, and I didn't stick around to find out. Might have magicked my fist through a wall or something,
buffy_summers Will, I'm sorry.
willow_rosenberg I mean, they're probably just friends. I press my lips against my friends' all the time.
buffy_summers I'm sure they're just friends. Once you fall for Willow, you stay fallen.
willow_rosenberg Thanks, Buffy.
xander_harris Hi.
willow_rosenberg Xander?
xander_harris I'm back.
buffy_summers Xander?
willow_rosenberg Xander, you're here!
willow_rosenberg We missed you, where were you?
xander_harris I know, I tried calling, but I couldn't without...
buffy_summers Hey. You don't need to explain to us.
xander_harris Right. Is she here?
willow_rosenberg Oh ... n-no, you ... wanna find her?
xander_harris I need to. Her suitcase is gone and some of her stuff. There's a Closed sign on the Magic Box, which, like, chills me to the bone.
willow_rosenberg She left a couple days ago.
xander_harris Was she looking for me? Before she left, did she say anything?
willow_rosenberg You mean, between sobs? There was mostly just wheezing.
buffy_summers She was a little ... she was ... kinda broken.
xander_harris I don't know how stuff got so mixed up! I blew it.
buffy_summers No. Well ... maybe it wasn't the best time to break up with her, but...
xander_harris No. It wasn't about breaking up. I love her, and god, I miss her so much.
willow_rosenberg So, you left her at the altar, but you still wanna-
buffy_summers You still wanna date?
xander_harris I guess. I know that I'm a better person with her in my life. But things got so complicated with the wedding, and with my family, and with her ... demons, and ... what if it all goes to hell, a-and forever? But then I left ... and ever since ... I've had this painful hole inside. And I'm the idiot that dug it out.
xander_harris I screwed up real bad.
buffy_summers Hey. We all screw up.
spike You lookin' for me?
buffy_summers Really not.
spike Oh. Right then. Off you go. Did you cry?
buffy_summers What?
spike The wedding. Two hearts joined for eternity, great pelting showers of rice and so forth.
buffy_summers You didn't hear.
spike What? Families get out of hand? Tear the place apart?
buffy_summers No. Well, yes, absolutely. But ... Xander left. The wedding didn't happen.
spike Well. Gotta say ... I didn't see that coming.
buffy_summers It was awful. Anya was devastated.
spike Is that right.
buffy_summers And, Xander ... thinks maybe they can still get back together, but ... he hurt her a lot.
spike Yeah, well ... some people can't see a good thing when they've got it.
xander_harris Spike.
xander_harris I shoulda known you'd be tagging along.
buffy_summers Hey, guys. I, uh ... I found Spike and was, uh, trying to figure out what kind of dangerous contraband he had.
spike Tell you what, Slayer. Let me get out of your way. I'll stop bothering you.
xander_harris Yeah, maybe you should do that, Spike, just run along.
spike You know, I guess you know all about that, don't you? The king of the big exit. Heard it brought the house down.
xander_harris I don't need this crap from you.
spike Right. Let's not listen to Spike. Might get a bit of the truth on you.
willow_rosenberg Okay, okay. Heh. Calm now. Let's, uh, turn around and release this very manly thing the other way.
xander_harris I forgot. Willy Wannabite can't hurt me. Dumb to pick a fight, I guess.
willow_rosenberg Xander.
buffy_summers Guys...
spike More than happy to beat you right through the pain, you pathetic poof.
buffy_summers Guys, don't.
MAN#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode17 Buffy, can you hear me?
buffy_summers What is this?
doctor Do you know where you are, Buffy?
buffy_summers Sunnydale.
doctor No, none of that's real, none of it. You're in a mental institution. You've been with us now for six years. Do you remember?
willow_rosenberg Buffy? Are you okay?
xander_harris What happened?
doctor It's okay, Buffy. Buffy, it's okay.
doctor Look. Look who's here.
joyce_summers Buffy?
joyce_summers Welcome home, sweetie.
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Oh, baby, you're really here.
buffy_summers Dad?
doctor She's lucid. Keep talking, maybe the sound of your voice will ground her.
hank_summers Sweetheart ... we've missed you very much. Honey, can you hear me?
joyce_summers Oh, Buffy, stay with us, please.
buffy_summers Oh ... no!
spike Here, let's get her back to my crypt.
xander_harris Spike, just go, okay? She's our friend, we'll take care of her.
buffy_summers No, guys, I'm okay. I'm okay.
willow_rosenberg Come on, Xander, help me get her home.
spike Put a little ice on the back of her neck.
spike She likes that.
buffy_summers I've been having these flashes. Hallucinations, I guess.
willow_rosenberg Since when?
buffy_summers Uh ... night before last.
buffy_summers I was, uh, checking houses on that list you gave me, and looking for Warren and his pals ... and then, bam! Some kind of gross, waxy demon-thing poked me.
xander_harris And when you say poke...
buffy_summers In the arm. It stung me or something, and ... then I was like ... no. It, it wasn't like. I *was* in an institution. There were, um ... doctors and ... nurses and, and other patients. They, they told me that I was sick. I guess crazy. And that, um, Sunnydale and, and all of this, it ... none of it ... was real.
xander_harris Oh, come on, that's ridiculous! What? You think this isn't real just because of all the vampires and demons and ex-vengeance demons and the sister that used to be a big ball of universe-destroying energy?
buffy_summers I know how this must sound, but ... it felt so real. Mom was there.
dawn_summers She was?
buffy_summers Dad, too. They were together ... like they used to be ... before Sunnydale.
willow_rosenberg Okay! All in favor of research? Motion passed. All right, Xander, you hit the demon bars. Dig up any info on a new player in town.
willow_rosenberg Dawnie, you can help me research. We'll hop on-line, check all the-
doctor -possibilities for a full recovery, but we have to proceed cautiously. If we're not careful
joyce_summers Wait.
joyce_summers Are you saying that Buffy could be like she was before any of this happened?
doctor Mrs. Summers, you have to understand the severity of what's happened to your daughter. For the last six years, she's been in an undifferentiated type of schizophrenia.
hank_summers We know what her condition is. That's not what we're asking.
doctor Buffy's delusions are multi-layered. She believes she's some type of hero.
joyce_summers The Slayer.
doctor The Slayer, right, but that's only one level. She's also created an intricate latticework to support her primary delusion. In her mind, she's the central figure in a fantastic world beyond imagination. She's surrounded herself with friends, most with their own superpowers ... who are as real to her as you or me. More so, unfortunately. Together they face ... grand overblown conflicts against an assortment of monsters both imaginary and rooted in actual myth. Every time we think we're getting through to her, more fanciful enemies magically appear-
buffy_summers How did I miss-
doctor and she's-
buffy_summers Warren and Jonathan, they did this to me!
doctor Buffy, it's all right. They can't hurt you here. You're with your family.
buffy_summers Dawn?
hank_summers That's the sister, right?
doctor A magical key. Buffy inserted Dawn into her delusion, actually rewriting the entire history of it to accommodate a need for a familial bond. Buffy, but that created inconsistencies, didn't it? Your sister, your friends, all of those people you created in Sunnydale, they aren't as comforting as they once were. Are they? They're coming apart.
joyce_summers Buffy, listen to what the doctor's saying, it's important.
doctor Buffy, you used to create these grand villains to battle against, and now what is it? Just ordinary students you went to high school with. No gods or monsters ... just three pathetic little men ... who like playing with toys.
warren_meers Dude, that poison has got her drooling like a, some kind of-
jonathan_levinson Where have you guys been?
warren_meers Uh ... picking up some stuff.
andrew_wells And checking out Buffy on the van's remote surveillance.
warren_meers Andrew's demon pet has done some number on the slayer. Got her tripping like a Ken Russell film festival.
jonathan_levinson Well, what kind of stuff?
warren_meers What?
jonathan_levinson The packages. What's in them?
warren_meers Well, what do you think, Spanky, you think we're plotting against you?
jonathan_levinson Better not be.
warren_meers It's just stuff, big man. All right, you'll be in the know just as soon as you stop being all freakazoid.
warren_meers Ah, now, there's the vault.
andrew_wells I still say we're gonna need eight other guys to pull this off.
warren_meers I never should have let you see that movie.
warren_meers Wha, uh, where you going?
jonathan_levinson Out. Getting stuff I need.
warren_meers You know, I don't really think that's such a good idea.
jonathan_levinson Why not?
warren_meers Well, it's... It's just not safe out there ... alone. You saw how close the slayer got. Look, we're, we're a team. Something happens to you, it happens to all of us. Right? Look, I know, I know you're antsy, we all are, but you see, things, they're about to pick up. Big, big time. Just gotta be careful. Right? All right? Stick together. Okay?
willow_rosenberg Look, Buffy, I found the demon. Fits your description and symptoms perfectly.
willow_rosenberg Look, is this it?
willow_rosenberg See, it's gonna be okay. Its pokey stinger carries an antidote to its own poison.
buffy_summers I feel so lost.
willow_rosenberg I know. You're confused. It's, it's that crazy juice inside you.
buffy_summers It's more than that. Even before the demon ... I've been so detached.
willow_rosenberg We've ... all been kind of slumming.
buffy_summers Every day I try to ... snap out of it. Figure out why I'm like that.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, look at me.
willow_rosenberg You are not in an institution. You have never been in an institution.
buffy_summers Yes, I have.
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers Back when I saw my first vampires... I got so scared. I told my parents ... and they completely freaked out. They thought there was something seriously wrong with me. So they sent me to a clinic.
willow_rosenberg You never said anything.
buffy_summers I was only there a couple of weeks. I stopped talking about it, and they let me go. Eventually ... my parents just ... forgot.
willow_rosenberg God. That's horrible.
buffy_summers What if I'm still there? What if I never left that clinic?
willow_rosenberg Buffy ... Buffy, you're not. I'm ... so sorry you had to go through that. But, i-it's the past. You've got to trust me. We're gonna get you that antidote. Xander's hunting the demon right now.
buffy_summers Alone? Will, he can't. It's too strong.
willow_rosenberg Oh, it's okay. We got help.
spike So, she's having the wiggins, is she? Thinks none of us are real. Bloody self-centered, if you ask me.
xander_harris Spike, we need muscle, not color commentary.
spike On the other hand, it might explain some things this all being in that twisted brain of hers. Yeah. Thinks up some chip in my head. Make me soft, fall in love with her, then turn me into her soddin' sex slave-
xander_harris What?!
spike Nothing. Alternative realities. Where we're all little figments of Buffy's funny-farm delusion. You know, in a different reality, you might not have left your bride at the altar. You might have gone through with it like a man.
xander_harris Okay, one more syllable about Anya-
spike Oh, balls. You didn't say he was a glarghk guhl kashma'nik
xander_harris 'Cause I can't say glar-
xander_harris I altered his reality. Get it, I... Never mind.
dawn_summers I made you some tea.
buffy_summers Thanks.
buffy_summers I'm okay, Dawn.
dawn_summers The, uh, thousand-yard stare really helps sell that.
dawn_summers You're burning up.
buffy_summers I should be taller than you.
dawn_summers Maybe you're not done growing.
buffy_summers Coming apart.
dawn_summers What's coming apart?
buffy_summers We have to try harder, make things better.
dawn_summers I'm trying.
buffy_summers Your grades ... stealing. Willow's been doing your chores, hasn't she?
dawn_summers What? No, i-it's ... it's the fever. It's cooking your brain.
buffy_summers We have to deal with these things, Dawn, we-
joyce_summers You don't have a sister, Buffy.
buffy_summers Dawn?
joyce_summers No, honey.
joyce_summers Say it. It'll help you believe it.
buffy_summers I ... don't ... have a sister. I know I, I didn't grow up with her. These monks, they-they made her.
hank_summers It's your mind, just playing tricks on you.
joyce_summers You're our little girl, Buffy. Our one and only. We've missed you so much. Mom and Dad just want to take you home and take care of you.
dawn_summers I'm not even there, am I?
buffy_summers What?
dawn_summers You said it a second ago. You don't have a sister.
dawn_summers It's your ideal reality, and I'm not even a part of it.
buffy_summers Dawn, I ... I didn't mean-
dawn_summers I have to go finish my chores.
xander_harris Hold it. Hold it!
willow_rosenberg I'll need its arm.
xander_harris Yeah, I'd like both my arms too.
xander_harris Thanks, Spike. I'll help when the ... blistering pain subsides.
willow_rosenberg Ready?
willow_rosenberg Xander, go to the magic shop.
willow_rosenberg I'll need alkanet root and a handful of nettle leaf. Just for the medicinal properties. No magic.
willow_rosenberg When you've got them, meet me at the campus lab. I'll see if I can brew up an antidote the old-fashioned way.
spike I'll hold here, keep an eye on the wax job.
xander_harris Make sure that's all you're ogling.
willow_rosenberg Xander!
willow_rosenberg Buffy? Wake up.
willow_rosenberg Got yummy antidote goodness for you.
buffy_summers What happened?
willow_rosenberg It took a little longer than I'd hoped. No magic and all. Went boom twice, but then I got it. Just ... when it's cool, drink it all down, and ... everything should go back to normal.
buffy_summers You never stop coming through. Thank you, Willow.
spike How is she?
willow_rosenberg Make sure she drinks all that. I'm gonna let Dawn know that everything's gonna be okay.
spike You all right?
buffy_summers You need to leave me alone. You're not part of my life.
spike Fine, then.
spike You know, but I hope you don't think this an-
spike I hope you don't think this antidote's gonna rid you of that nasty martyrdom. See, I figured it out, luv. You can't help yourself. You're not drawn to the dark like I thought.
spike You're addicted to the misery. It's why you won't tell your pals about us. Might actually have to be happy if you did. They'd either understand and help you, god forbid ... or drive you out ... where you can finally be at peace, in the dark. With me. Either way, you'd be better off for it, but you're too twisted for that. Let yourself live, already. And stop with the bloody hero trip for a sec. We'd all be the better for it.
spike You either tell your friends about us ... or I will.
doctor Buffy.
buffy_summers I don't wanna go back there.
buffy_summers I wanna be healthy again. What do I have to do?
buffy_summers Oh ... please, help me. I-I wanna go home, with you and dad.
joyce_summers I know, Buffy. But first you've gotta get better.
doctor It's not gonna be easy, Buffy. You have to take it one step at a time. You have to start ridding your mind of those things that support your hallucinations. You understand? There are things in that world that you cling to. For your delusion, they're safe-holds, but for your mind they're traps. We have to break those down.
buffy_summers Slaying?
doctor Yes ... but I'm talking about those things you want there. What keeps you going back.
buffy_summers My friends.
doctor That's right. Last summer, when you had a momentary awakening, it was them that pulled you back in.
joyce_summers They're not really your friends, Buffy. They're just ... tricks keeping you from getting healthy.
doctor You have to do whatever it takes to convince yourself of that, Buffy. Whatever it takes.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy, I, I didn't see you. I was just coming to check on you. You feeling better? Did the antidote work?
buffy_summers I'm ... still pretty dazed, but, uh, better.
willow_rosenberg No more cuckoo's nest? Well, we still have the big bad all tranked out down in the basement. In case it didn't work and we need more parts.
willow_rosenberg It'll be nice to see you all better.
buffy_summers Thanks.
willow_rosenberg I can make you some food, something big with energy, help you clear your noggin. Come on.
xander_harris Hello! I'm back! Clean and with the better smell now. Friends? Romans?
xander_harris Anyone?
xander_harris Hey.
xander_harris Hey, there, sane girl. So did Willow get that antidote to you all right?
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm better now.
xander_harris Great. So, it's settled. We're, uh, we're real, right? Guess we should finish off that demon and drag it out of the basement. And tell me you're up for that. I so don't wanna see Spike right now. I mean, talk about losing touch. Hate to say it, but I almost... feel sorry for the guy. Almost. The things the poor guy was saying ... I mean, I get it, you know. Been a part of the Buffy obsess-
xander_harris B-Buffy-
xander_harris Willow, what...
buffy_summers Dawn?
dawn_summers Don't you knock?
buffy_summers I called for you.
dawn_summers Buffy, are you okay?
buffy_summers Where are you going?
dawn_summers I'm going over to Janice's, where they actually like having me around.
buffy_summers You're not going anywhere.
dawn_summers Why not? You want me gone anyway. What do you care?
buffy_summers I care. You're going downstairs with the others. It's the only way I can get healthy.
dawn_summers What are you talking about?
dawn_summers Buffy, you look sick. What are you doing? What's wrong with you?
dawn_summers Stay away from me!
dawn_summers Willow, help!
dawn_summers Buffy, please!
buffy_summers You can't hide, Dawn.
dawn_summers Talk to me. You're hallucinating.
buffy_summers I know. You're just a trap for my mind.
dawn_summers Buffy, please, listen to me. That asylum and those people, they're not real!
dawn_summers Buffy ... look at me. I'm right here. You're my sister. I need you and love you. Somewhere inside you must know that's real.
buffy_summers Sure it is. 'Cause what's more real? A sick girl in an institution...
dawn_summers Don't. Please. Listen to me.
buffy_summers Or some kind of supergirl ... chosen to ... fight demons and... save the world. That's ridiculous.
buffy_summers A girl who sleeps with the vampire she hates?! Yeah, that makes sense.
dawn_summers No! Buffy, stop! I'm real!
dawn_summers Buffy, stop it. I'll be good!
dawn_summers I promise. You're not thinking. I'll-
doctor It's okay, Buffy. Don't stress yourself.
joyce_summers Honey, take your time.
doctor Make it as easy on yourself as possible. There's nothing wrong with that.
xander_harris Buffy ... what are you doing?
xander_harris Oh my god.
xander_harris Buffy, help me! I need my hands!
tara_maclay Hello?
tara_maclay Anybody home?
joyce_summers Buffy?
joyce_summers I-It's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Whatever it is, it's not real, remember? Just keep concentrating. I'm right here, sweetie.
xander_harris Buffy, help me!
xander_harris Buffy, help!
tara_maclay Willow?
willow_rosenberg No! Tara!
buffy_summers I don't know...
joyce_summers Buffy, look at me.
buffy_summers I don't know. I don't know.
joyce_summers I believe in you. You're a survivor, you can do this.
buffy_summers Xander. No.
buffy_summers Willow!
joyce_summers Buffy? Buffy! Buffy, fight it. You're too good to give in, you can beat this thing. Be strong, baby, ok? I know you're afraid. I know the world feels like a hard place sometimes, but you've got people who love you. Your dad and I, we have all the faith in the world in you. We'll always be with you.
joyce_summers You've got ... a world of strength in your heart. I know you do. You just have to find it again. Believe in yourself.
buffy_summers You're right. Thank you.
buffy_summers Good-bye.
joyce_summers Buffy.
buffy_summers I'm so sorry.
willow_rosenberg Buffy? We're okay. It's all okay. Buffy, sit down. You'll fall over.
buffy_summers No ... I can't. Not until I have the antidote.
willow_rosenberg Okay. We-we'll make more, we'll take care of it.
willow_rosenberg Everything's gonna be okay, Buffy.
doctor I'm sorry, there's no reaction at all.
doctor I'm afraid we lost her.
