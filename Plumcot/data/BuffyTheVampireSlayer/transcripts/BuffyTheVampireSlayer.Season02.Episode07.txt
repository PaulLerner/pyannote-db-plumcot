james C'mon, Mom. She's always late.
drusilla Are you lost?
james No. My mom's just supposed to pick me up is all.
drusilla Do you want me to walk you home?
james No, thank you.
drusilla My mummy used to sing me to sleep at night. Run and catch / The lamb is caught in the blackberry patch... She had the sweetest voice. What will your mummy sing when they find your body?
james I'm not supposed to talk to people.
drusilla Oh. Well, I'm not a person, see, so that's just...
angel Run home.
drusilla My Angel!
angel Hello, Drusilla.
drusilla Do you remember the song mummy used to sing me? Pretty.
angel I remember.
drusilla Yes, you do.
angel Drusilla, leave here. I'm offering you that chance. Take Spike and get out.
drusilla Or you'll hurt me?
drusilla No. No, you can't. Not anymore.
angel If you don't leave it'll go badly. For all of us.
drusilla My dear boy's gone all away, hasn't he? To her.
angel Who?
drusilla The girl. The Slayer.
drusilla Your heart stinks of her. Poor little thing. She has no idea what's in store.
angel This can't go on, Drusilla. It's gotta end.
drusilla Oh, no, my pet. This is just the beginning.
jenny_calendar It's a secret!
rupert_giles What kind of a secret?
jenny_calendar Uh, the kind that's secret. You know, where I don't actually tell you what it is.
rupert_giles I think it's customary that when two people are going out on an evening that they, they both have an idea of where they're going.
jenny_calendar Oh, come on! Where is your sense of adventure?
rupert_giles Well, I, I... Uh, how will I know what to wear?
jenny_calendar Do you own anything else?
rupert_giles Uh, w-well, not as such, no, um...
jenny_calendar Rupert, you're gonna have to trust me.
rupert_giles Alright, alright, I p-put myself in your hands.
jenny_calendar That sounds like fun. Okay, tomorrow night, 7:30, right?
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers Hey.
rupert_giles Hello. Um, did we hunt last night?
buffy_summers I did a couple quick sweeps downtown.
rupert_giles Any encounters?
buffy_summers Nothing vampirey.
rupert_giles Uh, I've been researching your friend Spike. Uh, the profile is fairly unappetizing. But I-I still haven't got a bead on why he's here.
buffy_summers You'll figure it out.
rupert_giles You alright? You seem a little glum.
buffy_summers I'm fine.
rupert_giles Why don't you take the night off?
buffy_summers Okay. That'd be nice.
rupert_giles Yes. You could spend some time with Angel.
buffy_summers I don't know. He might have other plans.
Boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 Well, it seems like Louis XVI was just sort of a weak king.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 That's fair enough. Uh, any other impressions?
cordelia_chase I just don't see why everyone's always picking on Marie Antoinette. I can so relate to her. She worked really hard to look that good, and people just don't appreciate that kind of effort.
Answer#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 No Dark hair Old dress pretty
cordelia_chase And I know the peasants were all depressed...
xander_harris I think you mean 'oppressed'.
cordelia_chase Whatever. They were cranky.
cordelia_chase So they're, like, 'Let's lose some heads'. Uhhh! That's fair. And, and Marie Antoinette cared about them. She was gonna let them have cake!
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 Yes, well, that's a very interesting perspective.
Teacher#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 Um, would anyone else like to comment?
buffy_summers I don't know. I don't think so. They seemed pretty friendly.
xander_harris Who's friendly?
buffy_summers No one.
willow_rosenberg Angel and a girl.
buffy_summers Willow, do we have to be in total share mode?
xander_harris Hey, it's me. If Angel's doing somethin' wrong, I wanna know. 'Cause it gives me a happy!
buffy_summers Mm, I'm glad someone has a happy.
xander_harris Aw, you just need cheering up. And I know just the thing! Crazed dance party at the Bronze!
buffy_summers I dunno.
xander_harris Very calm dance party at the Bronze? Moping at the Bronze.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I'd suggest a box of Oreos dunked in apple juice, but maybe she's over that phase.
buffy_summers Ford?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Hey, Summers!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go How ya been?
buffy_summers Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Uh, matriculating.
buffy_summers Huh?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I'm finishing out my senior year at Sunnydale High. Dad got transferred.
buffy_summers This is great!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I'm glad you think so.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I didn't think you'd remember me.
buffy_summers Remember you? Duh! We only went to school together for seven years. You were my giant fifth grade crush.
xander_harris So! You two know each other.
buffy_summers Oh! I'm sorry. Um, this is Ford! Uh, Billy Fordham, this is Xander and Willow!
xander_harris Hi.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Hey.
willow_rosenberg Nice to meet you!
buffy_summers Uh, Ford and I went to Hemery together in L.A. And now you're here. For real?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Dad got the transfer, and boom, he just dragged me outta Hemery and put me down here.
buffy_summers This is great! Well, I mean, it's hard, sudden move, all your friends, delicate time, very emotional, but let's talk about me! This is great!
willow_rosenberg So, you two were sweeties in fifth grade?
buffy_summers Not even. Ford wouldn't give me the time of day.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Well, I was a manly sixth-grader. I couldn't bother with someone that young.
buffy_summers It was terrible. I moped over you for months. Sitting in my room listening to that Divinyls song 'I Touch Myself'.
buffy_summers Of course, I had no idea what it was about.
buffy_summers Hey, are you busy tonight? We're going to the Bronze, it's the local club, and you have to come.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I'd love to! But if you guys already had plans... Would I be imposing?
xander_harris No, only in the literal sense.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Okay, then! I, I gotta find the admissions office, uh, get my papers in order.
buffy_summers Well, you know what, I'll take you there, and I'll see you guys in French!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go It was good to meet you.
xander_harris This is Ford, my bestest friend of all my friends! Jeez, doesn't she know any fat guys?
willow_rosenberg Oh, that's what that song is about?!
buffy_summers Ford! You made it.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Wasn't hard to find.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, Ford was just telling us about the ninth grade beauty contest, and the, uh, swimsuit competition.
buffy_summers Oh, my God, Ford, stop that! The more people you tell, the more people I have to kill.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go You can't touch me, Summers. I know all your darkest secrets.
xander_harris Care to make a small wager on that?
buffy_summers I'm gonna go get a drink. Ford, try not to talk.
buffy_summers Hi.
angel Hey! I was hoping you'd show.
buffy_summers You drink! I mean, drinks. Non-blood things.
angel There's a lot about me you don't know.
buffy_summers I believe that.
willow_rosenberg That's Angel.
xander_harris He's Buffy's beau. Her special friend.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go He's not in school, right? He looks older than her.
xander_harris You're not wrong.
buffy_summers So. What'd you do last night?
angel Nothin'.
buffy_summers Nothing at all. You ceased to exist?
angel No, I mean I stayed in, read.
buffy_summers Oh.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Didn't want that soda after all?
buffy_summers Not thirsty.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Angel.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Hi.
buffy_summers This is Ford. We went to school together in L.A.
angel Nice to meet you.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Whoa! Cold hands!
xander_harris You're not wrong.
angel So, you're here visiting Buffy?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go No, I'm actually here to stay. Just moved down.
willow_rosenberg Hey, Angel? Do you wanna play?
buffy_summers Y'know, it's getting really crowded in here tonight. Um... I'm a little hot. You wanna take a walk?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Um, sure! That'd be nice.
buffy_summers Okay, then, um... I'll see ya tomorrow.
angel Good night.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Take care.
xander_harris Okay, once more with tension.
angel He just moved here?
xander_harris Yeah. And, boy, does he move fast.
willow_rosenberg Well, Angel, we could still play.
willow_rosenberg See, you made him do that thing where he's gone.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go So, that was your boyfriend?
buffy_summers No. Uh, yeah. Maybe. Could we lay off the tough questions for a while?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Sorry. So! What else do you do for fun around here?
buffy_summers Um, my purse. I-I, I left my purse at the Bronze. Uh, could you get it for me?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Uh, okay.
buffy_summers Good. Run! Thanks!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go What's goin' on?
buffy_summers Um... uh, there was a, a cat. A cat here, and, um, then there was a-another cat... and they fought. The cats. And... then they left.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Oh. I thought you were just slaying a vampire.
buffy_summers What? Whating a what?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I know, Buffy. You don't have to lie. I-I've been trying to figure out the right time to, to tell you. I know you're the Slayer.
willow_rosenberg Just like that he told you?
buffy_summers Just like that. Said he found out right before I got booted from Hemery.
willow_rosenberg Wow! It's neat! Is it neat?
buffy_summers Yeah, I guess it is. I don't have to constantly worry that he's gonna find out my dark secret. It just makes everything easier.
diego Ford? Hi, Ford?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Hey!
diego Well, how'd it go?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go It went good.
diego Good? That's, that's it? That's all we know? Well, when are we...
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Soon.
diego Oh, soon, okay. Y'know, you could gimme a little more information here. I'm trusting you. I'm out on a limb here. Not to mention the lease is almost up on this place. Who's gonna cover that?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Marvin...
diego Diego! C'mon, man, it's Diego now.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Diego. Ritalin. Everything's gonna be fine.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Just make sure you're ready when I say. True believers only.
chanterelle I can't wait!
diego Right, whatever, I still think I should be in on the plan.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Diego, you gotta trust me.
TV#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 Alright.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go A couple more days and we'll get to do the two things every American teen should have the chance to do: die young, and stay pretty.
Jack#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 So... You play your wits against mine. Me, who commanded armies hundreds of years before you were born. Fools!
willow_rosenberg Oh! Angel! What are you doing here?
angel I wanted to talk to you.
willow_rosenberg Oh, well...
willow_rosenberg Well?
angel I can't. Unless you invite me, I can't come in.
willow_rosenberg Oh! Well, okay, I invite you. To come in.
angel I-if this is a bad time, I...
willow_rosenberg No! I just... I'm not supposed to have boys in my room.
angel I promise to behave myself.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Good.
angel I guess I need help.
willow_rosenberg Help? You mean like on homework? No, 'cause you're old and you already know stuff.
angel I want you to track someone down. On the 'Net.
willow_rosenberg Oh! Great! I'm so the 'Net girl.
angel I just wanna find everything I can. Records, affiliates, I'm not even sure what I'm looking for yet.
willow_rosenberg Good. What's the name?
angel Billy Fordham.
willow_rosenberg Uh, Angel? If I say something you really don't wanna hear, do you promise not to bite me?
angel Are you gonna tell me that I'm jealous?
willow_rosenberg Well, you do sometimes get that way.
angel You know, I never used to. Things used to be pretty simple. A hundred years, just hanging out, feelin' guilty... I really honed my brooding skills. Then she comes along. Yeah, I get jealous. But I know people. And my gut tells me this is a wrong guy.
willow_rosenberg Okay. But if there isn't anything weird... Hey, that's weird.
angel What?
willow_rosenberg I just checked the school records, and he's not in them. I mean, usually they transfer your grades and stuff, but he's not even registered.
angel He said he was in school with you guys, right?
willow_rosenberg Let me just see if I can...
sheila_rosenberg Willow? Are you still up?
willow_rosenberg Ack! Go! Iiiiiii'm just going to bed now, mom!
willow_rosenberg Come by tomorrow at sunset. I'll keep looking.
angel Don't tell Buffy what we're doing, alright?
willow_rosenberg You want me to lie to her? It's Buffy!
angel Just don't bring it up until we know what's what.
willow_rosenberg Okay. I-it's probably nothing.
angel That'd be nice.
buffy_summers Willow!
buffy_summers What's up?
willow_rosenberg Nothing.
buffy_summers Do you wanna hang? We're cafeteria-bound.
willow_rosenberg I-I-I'm gonna do work in the computer lab on school work that I have, so I cannot hang just now. Hi, Ford.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Morning.
buffy_summers Okay, Will, fess up.
willow_rosenberg What?
buffy_summers Are you drinking coffee again? 'Cause we've talked about this.
willow_rosenberg It makes me jumpy. I have to go. Away.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Nice girl!
buffy_summers There aren't two of those in the world.
rupert_giles Buffy! Um... Yes, uh... Ms. Calendar and I are going... somewhere tonight, and she's given, oh, given me the number of her beeper thingy, uh, in case you need me for, um... study help, uh, suddenly.
buffy_summers He knows, Giles.
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Ford knows I'm the Slayer.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I know.
rupert_giles Oh! Uh, very good, yes. Uh, um, Buffy... Excuse me. You are not, by any chance, betraying your secret identity just to impress, um, cute boys, are you?
buffy_summers I didn't tell him. He knew.
rupert_giles Oh! Uh, right then. Well, uh, just remember, if you...
buffy_summers Go! Experience this thing called fun. I'll try not to have a crisis.
buffy_summers And on your right, once again, the beautiful campus. I think you've now seen everything there is to see in Sunnydale.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Well, it's... really...
buffy_summers Feel free to say dull.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Okay. Dull's good. Or maybe not so dull. Is that more vampires?
buffy_summers Must be the weather.
buffy_summers Stay close to me.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Maybe they were just passing through.
buffy_summers I don't think so.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go You've got one chance to live. Tell me what I wanna know, and I'll let you go.
buffy_summers Where's the other one?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I killed her. I, I killed her and she just turned to dust. It was... amazing!
willow_rosenberg The only thing I could track down was this address. The Sunset Club. Still didn't find anything incriminating.
angel He leaves no paper trail, no records, that's incriminating enough.
xander_harris Yeah, I'm gonna have to go with Dead Boy on this one.
angel Could you *not* call me that?
angel We're friends of Ford's.
willow_rosenberg Boy, we blend right in.
xander_harris In no way do we stick out like sore thumbs.
angel Let's look around. You guys check out downstairs.
xander_harris Sure thing, Bossy the cow!
willow_rosenberg Okay, but do they really stick out?
xander_harris What?
willow_rosenberg Sore thumbs. Do they stick out? I mean, have you ever seen a thumb and gone, 'Wow! That baby is sore!'
xander_harris You have too many thoughts.
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 Hi!
xander_harris Are you probably noticing a theme here?
willow_rosenberg As in 'Vampires! Yay!'?
xander_harris That's the one.
chanterelle You guys are newbies. I can tell.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no. We come here all the time.
chanterelle Don't be ashamed! It's cool that you're open to it. We welcome anyone who's interested in the Lonely Ones.
willow_rosenberg The Lonely Ones?
angel Vampires.
xander_harris Oh! We usually call them the nasty, pointy, bitey ones.
chanterelle So many people have that misconception. But they who walk with the night are not interested in harming anyone. They are creatures above us. Exalted!
angel You're a fool.
chanterelle You don't have to be so confrontational about it. Other viewpoints than yours may be valid, you know.
willow_rosenberg Nice meeting you.
xander_harris You really are a people person.
willow_rosenberg Now nobody's gonna talk to us.
angel I've seen enough. I've seen this type before. I mean, they're children making up bedtime stories of friendly vampires to comfort themselves in the dark.
willow_rosenberg Is that so bad? I mean, the dark can get pretty dark. Sometimes you need a story.
angel These people don't know anything about vampires. What they are, how they live, how they dress...
xander_harris You know, I love a good diatribe. But I'm still curious why Ford, the bestest friend of the Slayer, is hanging with a bunch of vampire wannabes.
willow_rosenberg Something's up with him, you're right about that.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode07 Are you okay?
buffy_summers Sorry to beep you guys in the middle of... stuff, but it seemed really weird.
rupert_giles No, you did the right thing. Absolutely.
jenny_calendar You hated it that much?
rupert_giles No! But, but, uh, vampires on campus is, could have implications. Very, very grave...
jenny_calendar You coulda just said something.
rupert_giles Uh, honestly, I, I've always, I've always been interested in, in, uh, monster trucks.
buffy_summers You took him to monster trucks?
jenny_calendar I thought it would be a change!
rupert_giles It was a change.
jenny_calendar Look, we could've just left.
rupert_giles Wha-what, and miss the nitro-burning funny cars? No, couldn't have that.
buffy_summers Okay, can we get back on the vampire tip here? These guys were here with a purpose.
rupert_giles Yes, yes, and, uh, we must, uh, ascertain what that purpose is.
jenny_calendar Where's your friend?
buffy_summers I sent him home.
rupert_giles Oh, uh, good. Yes, the less he's involved in all this, the safer he'll be.
buffy_summers He did bag a vamp his first time out.
buffy_summers Gotta give him credit for... that.
jenny_calendar Something wrong?
buffy_summers Who's this?
rupert_giles Um, she's called Drusilla, a sometime paramour of Spike's. She was killed by an angry mob in Prague.
buffy_summers Well, they don't make angry mobs like they used to, 'cause this girl's alive. I saw her with Angel.
rupert_giles With Angel?
jenny_calendar Isn't he supposed to be a good guy?
buffy_summers Yeah. He is.
jenny_calendar I think maybe we need to read up on this nice lady.
rupert_giles Well, some of my new volumes may be more helpful. Uh, my own research is...
jenny_calendar Are you guys okay?
rupert_giles A book! It took one of my books!
jenny_calendar Well, at least someone in this school is reading.
buffy_summers He said he killed it. That's the vampire Ford said he killed.
drusilla You sing the sweetest little song. Won't you sing for me, hmm? Don't you love me anymore?
spike Darling! I heard a funny thing just now. Lucius tells me that you went out on a hunt the other night.
drusilla My tummy was growly. And you were out. Come on. I'll pout if you don't sing.
spike You, um, meet anyone? Anyone interesting? Like Angel?
drusilla Angel.
spike Yeah. So... What might you guys have talked about, then? Old times? Childhood pranks? It's a little off, you two so friendly, him being the enemy and all that.
drusilla I'll give you a seed if you sing.
spike The bird's dead, Dru. You left it in a cage, and you didn't feed it, and now it's all dead, just like the last one.
spike Oh, I'm sorry baby. I'm a bad, rude man. I just don't like you goin' out, that's all. You are weak. Would you like a new bird? One that's not dead?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go This is so cool!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I would totally live here.
spike Do I have anyone on watch here? It's called security, people. Are you all asleep? Or did we finally find a restaurant that delivers?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I know who you are.
spike Yeah, I know who I am, too. So what?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I came looking for you, Spike. You are Spike, right? William the Bloody?
spike You've got a real death wish. It's almost interesting.
spike Oh, this is great. This'll be very useful. So, how did you find me?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go That doesn't matter. I've got something to offer you. I-I'm pretty sure this is the part where you take out a watch and say I've got thirty seconds to convince you not to kill me? It's traditional.
spike Well, I don't go much for tradition.
drusilla Wait, love.
spike Well?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Oh, c'mon! Say it! It's no fun if you don't say it.
spike What? Oh. You've got thirty seconds to convince me not to kill you.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Yes! See, this is the best! I wanna be like you. A vampire.
spike I've known you for two minutes, and I can't stand you. I don't really feature you livin' forever. Can I eat him now, love?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Well, feature this: I'm offering you a trade. You make me a vampire, and I give you the Slayer.
angel Buffy. May I come in?
buffy_summers Sure. I thought once you were invited you could always just walk in.
angel I can. I was just being polite. We need to talk.
buffy_summers Do we?
angel It's about your friend Ford. He's not what he seems.
buffy_summers Who is these days?
angel Willow ran him down on the computer.
buffy_summers Willow?
angel We found this address, we checked it out with Xander, and it turned out...
buffy_summers And Xander? Wow. Everybody's in. It's like a great big exciting conspiracy.
angel What are you talking about?
buffy_summers I'm talking about the people I trust. Who's Drusilla?
buffy_summers And don't lie to me. I'm tired of it.
angel Some lies are necessary.
buffy_summers For what?
angel Sometimes the truth is worse. You live long enough, you find that out.
buffy_summers I can take it. I can take the truth.
angel Do you love me?
buffy_summers What?
angel Do you?
buffy_summers I love you. I don't know if I trust you.
angel Maybe you shouldn't do either.
buffy_summers Maybe I'm the one who should decide!
angel I did a lot of unconscionable things when I became a vampire. Drusilla was the worst. She was... an obsession of mine. She was pure and sweet and chaste...
buffy_summers And you made her a vampire.
angel First I made her insane. Killed everybody she loved. Visited every mental torture on her I could devise. She eventually fled to a convent, and on the day she took her holy orders, I turned her into a demon.
buffy_summers Well. I asked for the truth.
angel Ford's part of some society that reveres vampires. Practically worships them. I don't know what he wants from you, but you can't trust him.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Buffy!
buffy_summers Ford.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I had a great time last night. Well, an interesting time.
buffy_summers I'm glad.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Do you wanna go out again tonight?
buffy_summers Not busy.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I sort of had an idea. It's a... It's a secret. Kinda wanna surprise you.
buffy_summers I like surprises.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Can you meet me here?
buffy_summers Sure.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go At nine?
buffy_summers At nine.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go It's gonna be fun!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Did, uh, Angel...
buffy_summers He told me everything.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry we kept stuff from you.
buffy_summers It's okay.
willow_rosenberg When Angel came to my room he was just really concerned for you, and we didn't wanna say anything in case we were wrong.
xander_harris Did you find out what Ford is up to?
buffy_summers I will.
xander_harris Angel was in your bedroom?
willow_rosenberg Ours is a forbidden love.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Chantarelle. Is everything ready?
diego Of course. It's ready. Hi, I took care of it. I always take care of it.
chanterelle Is it time? Tonight?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go You nervous?
chanterelle Yes. No. I'm ready for the change. Do you really think they'll bless us?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I know they will.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Everything's falling into place.
diego What about your friends? Are they comin'?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go What are you talking about?
diego Your friends. They came. Last night. Two guys and a girl.
chanterelle One was mean.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Oh, Christ! Why didn't you tell me about this?
diego I have to do everything around here. Sorry, Mr. Flawless Plan Guy, it slipped my mind.
chanterelle It's gonna be alright, isn't it?
chanterelle They're not gonna let us down?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go It's gonna be fine.
chanterelle I need them to bless me.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go It's gonna be fine!
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers It's really not.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go It's kinda drafty in here.
buffy_summers I'm sorry, Ford. I just couldn't wait till tonight! I'm rash and impulsive. It's a flaw.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go We all have flaws.
buffy_summers I'm still a little fuzzy on exactly what yours is. I think it has to do with being a lying scumbag.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Everybody lies.
buffy_summers What do you want, Ford? What's this all about?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I really don't think you'd understand.
buffy_summers I don't need to understand. I just need to know.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I'm gonna be one of them.
buffy_summers You wanna be a vampire?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I'm going to.
buffy_summers You know, vampires are a little picky about who they change ov... You were gonna offer them a trade!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I don't think I wanna talk anymore.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, I still feel awfully chatty! You were gonna give them me! Tonight!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Yes.
buffy_summers You had to know I'd figure it out.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Actually, I was counting on it.
buffy_summers What's supposed to happen tonight?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go This is *so* cool! It's just like it played in my head. You know that part where you ask me what's supposed to happen? It's already happening.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Rigged up special. Once it's closed, it can only be opened from the outside. As soon as the sun sets, they'll be comin'.
buffy_summers Ford, if these people are still around when they get here...
diego We'll be changed. All of us.
chanterelle We're going to ascend to a new level of consciousness! Become like them. Like the Lonely Ones.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go This is the end, Buffy. No one gets outta here alive.
buffy_summers There's gotta be another way out of here!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go This is a bomb shelter, Buffy. I knew I wasn't gonna be able to overpower you. But this is three feet of solid concrete. Trust me when I say we're in for the long haul.
buffy_summers At least let the other people go.
chanterelle Why are you fighting this? It's what we want!
diego It's our chance for immortality.
chanterelle This is a beautiful day. Can't you see that?
buffy_summers What I see is that, right after the sun goes down, Spike and all of his friends are going to be pigging out at the all-you-can-eat moron bar.
diego Okay, that's it. I think we should gag her.
buffy_summers I think you should try.
diego She's an unbeliever. She taints us.
buffy_summers I am trying to save you! You are playing in some serious traffic here! Do you understand that? You're going to die! And the only hope you have of surviving this is to get out of this pit right now, and, my God, could you have a dorkier outfit?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I gotta back her up, D. You look like a big ninny. 6:27. Sunset.
spike When we get there, everybody spread out. Two men on the door, first priority's the Slayer, everything else is fair game, and let's remember to share, people. Are you sure you're up for this?
drusilla I want a treat. I need a treat.
spike And a special one you'll have. Lucius! Bring the car around.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Hey, you never give up, do you?
buffy_summers No, I don't.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go That's a good quality in a person. Too many people, they just lay back and take it, but us...
buffy_summers Us? We have something in common now?
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go More than you think.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, let me explain something to you. You're what we call the bad guy.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I guess I am!
buffy_summers These people aren't gonna get changed, are they? The rest of them, they're just fodder.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Technically, yes. But I'm in. I will become immortal.
buffy_summers Well, I've got a news flash for you, braintrust: that's not how it works. You die, and a demon sets up shop in your old house, and it walks, and it talks, and it remembers your life, but it's not you.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go It's better than nothing.
buffy_summers And your life is nothing?
buffy_summers Ford, these people don't deserve to die!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Well, neither do I! But apparently no one took that into consideration, 'cause I'm still dying.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I look good, don't I? Well, let me tell you something: I've got maybe six months left, and by then what they bury won't even *look* like me. It'll be bald and shriveled and it'll smell bad. No, I'm not going out that way.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go I'm sorry, Summers. Did I screw up your righteous anger riff? Does the nest of tumors liquefying my brain kinda spoil the fun?
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I had no idea. But what you're doing is still very wrong.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Okay, well, you try vomiting for twenty-four hours straight because the pain in your head is so intense, and *then* we'll discuss the concept of right and wrong. These people are sheep. They wanna be vampires 'cause they're lonely, miserable or bored. I don't have a choice.
buffy_summers You have a choice. You don't have a good choice, but you have a choice! You're opting for mass murder here, and nothing you say is gonna make that okay!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go You think I need to justify myself to you?
buffy_summers I think this is all part of your little fantasy drama! Isn't this exactly how you imagined it? You tell me how you've suffered and I feel sorry for you. Well, I do feel sorry for you, and if those vampires come in here and start feeding, I'll kill you myself!
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go You know what, Summers? I really did miss you.
buffy_summers Ford, help me stop this. Please!
buffy_summers People, listen to me! This is not the mothership, people! This is ugly death come to play!
spike Take them all. Save the Slayer for me.
buffy_summers Spike!
spike Everybody STOP!
buffy_summers Good idea. Now you let everyone out, or your girlfriend fits in an ashtray.
drusilla Spike?
spike It's gonna be alright, baby. Let them go!
buffy_summers Down the stairs.
spike Uh, where's the doorknob?
buffy_summers You guys are just in time.
willow_rosenberg Are there vampires?
buffy_summers They're contained. They'll get out eventually, though. We should probably go. We can come back when they're gone.
xander_harris Come back for what?
buffy_summers For the body.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go What happened?
spike We're stuck in a basement.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Buffy?
spike She's *not* stuck in the basement.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go Hey, well, I delivered. I handed her to you.
spike Yes, I suppose you did.
blond_vamp_ford_lets_go So? What about my reward?
buffy_summers I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
rupert_giles You needn't say anything.
buffy_summers It'd be simpler if I could just hate him. I think he wanted me to. I think it made it easier for him to be the villain of the piece. Really he was just scared.
rupert_giles Yes, I suppose he was.
buffy_summers Nothing's ever simple anymore. I'm constantly trying to work it out. Who to love or hate. Who to trust. It's just, like, the more I know, the more confused I get.
rupert_giles I believe that's called growing up.
buffy_summers I'd like to stop then, okay?
rupert_giles I know the feeling.
buffy_summers Does it ever get easy?
rupert_giles You mean life?
buffy_summers Yeah. Does it get easy?
rupert_giles What do you want me to say?
buffy_summers Lie to me.
rupert_giles Yes, it's terribly simple.
rupert_giles The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, uh, we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after.
buffy_summers Liar.
