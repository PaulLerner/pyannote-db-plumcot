buffy_summers Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
quentin_travers Glory isn't a demon. She's a god.
glory Tell me where the key is.
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 We had to hide the key. Made it human...
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 ... and sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn.
RILEY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
RILEY_VOICEOVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Buffy's like nobody else in the world. But she doesn't love me.
RILEY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 They want me back, Buffy.
buffy_summers Are you going?
RILEY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 I don't know. If we can't work this out...
buffy_summers This is goodbye?
buffy_summers Riley!
buffy_summers There's something that you need to know. About Dawn.
dawn_summers Why does everybody start acting all weird when I'm around?
spike They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life. So they sent the key to her in the form of a sister.
dawn_summers Is this blood?
buffy_summers What did you do?
dawn_summers I'm not a key.
dawn_summers I'm not real.
buffy_summers You're the key. Go. Before she finds you. She's here!
spike I love you.
buffy_summers The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
buffy_summers I want you out. I want you out of this town, I want you off this planet! You don't come near me, my friends, or my family again ever! Understand?
buffy_summers Spike! Spike wants me, how obscene is that?
rupert_giles Well, it is very strange. I can't imagine what he's thinking. Uh, not, not that you're not, uh, attractive...
buffy_summers I feel gross, you know, like, like, dirty.
rupert_giles That's ridiculous, you can't be responsible for what Spike thinks or, feels.
buffy_summers Well, aren't I responsible? I mean, something about me had to make him feel that, right? Something that made him say, woof, that's the one for me!
rupert_giles Buffy, I think you should perhaps calm down.
xander_harris Me too.
buffy_summers Oh! Puffy Xander, uh, I'm sorry, I got ... guess I got carried away. Are you okay?
xander_harris I'm alive. I can tell 'cause of the pain.
buffy_summers Do you wanna sit down?
xander_harris I'm not that bendy. I could lean.
rupert_giles I'll get some ice.
buffy_summers Here.
buffy_summers Comfy?
xander_harris Oh, yeah. This leaning? This is the stuff.
buffy_summers That's my secret to attracting men. You know, it's simple really, you slap 'em around a bit, you torture 'em, you make their lives a living hell-
xander_harris Buff...
buffy_summers ...and sure, the nice guys, they'll run away, but every now and then you'll meet a real prince of a guy like Spike who gets off on it.
xander_harris Buffy ... Stand me up.
xander_harris The problem is not you. Don't do this to yourself, please.
buffy_summers It's just ... I just wanna know that there's gonna be another good one. One that I won't chase away.
xander_harris There will be. Promise. He's out there, he could come along any minute.
buffy_summers Yeah, and the minute after that I can terrify him with my alarming strength and remarkable self-involvement.
xander_harris What? I don't think you're like that.
buffy_summers Maybe I could change. You know, I could, I could work harder. I could spend less time slaying, I could laugh at his jokes, I mean, men like that, right, the, the joke-laughing-at?
xander_harris Or maybe you could just be Buffy, he'll see your amazing heart, and he'll fall in love with you.
buffy_summers Xander, that's ... aw!
xander_harris This is the day you choose to hug me? Buffy?
buffy_summers Mm?
xander_harris You ever think maybe the reason you haven't found a great relationship on the Hellmouth is ... because it's a Hellmouth? Seems to me it's a pretty terrible place to try to build anything.
buffy_summers Mm.
april Thank you for picking me up. I'm very grateful for the ride.
driver You sure you want to get out here? I mean, this place is kinda ... what are you looking for in Sunnydale, anyway?
april True love.
buffy_summers I might like it more than the others. Can you spin around again?
dawn_summers Ooh, I'm not sure. Once more.
buffy_summers Now could you go the other way?
joyce_summers You're messing with me!
buffy_summers We just wanted to see how many times we could get you to do it.
dawn_summers Was that five, or four and a half?
joyce_summers So is anyone gonna talk about my dress?
dawn_summers I like it.
joyce_summers You sure? I mean, it's not too mom-ish?
dawn_summers Oh. That was why I liked it.
buffy_summers You're both crazy. It's not mom-ish at all. It's sexy. It screams, Randy sex kitten, buy me one drink and I'll... Oh, wait, that's not really good either.
joyce_summers Oh god. What time is it?
buffy_summers 4:23. You have lots of time until seven. Vast acres of time in which you could plant crops. Now tell me about this Brian and what his intentions are.
dawn_summers Maybe he's a gigolo. Was his shirt all shiny?
joyce_summers No! He works for a publishing house. He's a nice normal guy, okay?
buffy_summers I think I've heard of those.
joyce_summers He came to the gallery ... my first day back, when I was, you know, kinda shaky, starting over. And he asked a question about these antique cameos and I was so lost, because ... Carol had been doing the ordering while I was sick. Well, it turned out that he didn't know anything about them either, so we had a lot to talk about.
dawn_summers So what's the plan for tonight?
joyce_summers Dinner and then a movie. Or maybe it was ... a movie and then dinner. Which might be better, because ... you know, then we could talk about the movie. Or maybe a movie isn't a good idea at all, because, well, you know, you can't talk during, and, and then, you know, what's the point of any of it? Oh, and about the restaurant. Do you think ... that it should be one with candles, and romantic music, or is that pushing it? Buffy, what do you think? Should I, you know, try to make things romantic, or ... sorta let him set the pace?
buffy_summers Oh, no. Love Doctor Buffy is not in. I am not qualified to give dating advice. I've had exactly two boyfriends, and they both left. Really left. Left town left.
joyce_summers Honey, you just had some bad luck.
dawn_summers Well, you're going to that spring break party tonight. Maybe you'll find someone there.
buffy_summers Mm-hmm. Or maybe Brian has a son, and Mom and I can go on some unspeakably awkward double dates.
joyce_summers Oh god... Brian. What time is it now?
buffy_summers 4:24.
joyce_summers You sure the dress is okay?
dawn_summers Hmm. Spin again. Real fast this time.
tara_maclay Willow's good at all that computer stuff, but me not so much. Do you really understand all that?
anya Oh. Well, at first it was confusing. Just the idea of computers was like, whoa, I'm eleven hundred years old. I had trouble adjusting to the idea of Lutherans.
tara_maclay I go online sometimes, but ... everyone's spelling is really bad, and it's ... depressing.
anya But you have to try online trading, it's great! The secret is avoiding the tech companies everyone was jumping on, and, and going with the smaller firms that supply the basic components.
tara_maclay Uh-huh.
anya Anyway, I took the money from working for Giles, and I tripled it.
tara_maclay Tripled? Like, first money, then money money money?
anya Yes. I'm thinking about buying something very expensive. Maybe an antelope.
april Hi.
anya Hi.
april I'm looking for Warren. Do you know where Warren is? And if you do, could you tell me?
tara_maclay Um, I, I don't think we know a Warren.
april Well, all righty, no harm in asking. Thanks!
april Hi, do you know Warren? I need to find him.
BENCH_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Uh, sorry.
tara_maclay You, you can do all this stuff with a regular computer?
anya I'll show you. You can also see the website I designed for the magic shop. Huge photo of me.
xander_harris How you doing, having o' the fun?
buffy_summers You know, I am. Dancing with you is way better than trying to hook up with some good-looking guy.
xander_harris I think I liked it better when you were kicking me in my puffy groin.
anya I let them do that. Dance together. That was me.
tara_maclay Very nice of you.
willow_rosenberg A good deed.
anya Yes. I'm expecting a big karmic reward any second now.
buffy_summers Thank you.
ben Buffy.
buffy_summers Ben! Hey. I didn't even know you were here. And again with the non-medical clothing.
ben Well, actually, these are orthopedic pants. Man, that sounded so funny in my head.
buffy_summers It's very, very funny. It's funny in my head too.
ben You having a good time?
buffy_summers Yeah, I am. I was dancing earlier, and you know, my friends are here, so ... but, I mean, not that it's all about me. Are you enjoying yourself?
ben I am now.
buffy_summers So, um ... do you ... maybe ... wanna dance?
ben I'm not really good. You know, rhythm. Uh, sure. I'd love to. Let me just dump this. I'll be right back.
buffy_summers Okay.
anya Look at these tiny grain patties. They're woven. That's craftsmanship.
xander_harris They aren't hand-woven, you know.
anya Then how?
xander_harris Well, it's a, a machine, and it's ... it sorta .. it presses.
xander_harris And there may be a mold of some sort ... who's that?
april Warren?
anya Oh, that girl. Tara and I met her.
anya She speaks with a strange evenness and selects her words a shade too precisely.
xander_harris Well, some of us like that kind of thing in a girl.
april Warren?
katrina_silber Hi, did you get me a drink?
warren_meers We gotta go, she's gonna see me.
katrina_silber She who? What's up, Warren?
warren_meers It doesn't matter. Come on.
april Is Warren here?
willow_rosenberg I thought you were getting the crunchies.
anya Xander got hypnotized by the strange girl. I am remaining calm, however.
xander_harris Uh-uh, no, I'm, I'm right with you. You don't know what you're talking about. Here she comes.
april I heard that Warren was here. Is Warren here?
xander_harris Um, Warren who?
april He's ... Warren. And he's looking for me. He lost me.
april Is Warren here?
tara_maclay It's that girl again. Is she still looking for Warren? Weird, it's been like all day.
willow_rosenberg There's something strange about her. She talks funny.
anya Some men find that appealing.
april Have you guys seen Warren?
tara_maclay I just hope she finds him.
xander_harris Somehow I don't think a girl that looks like that's gonna be lonely for too long.
willow_rosenberg Definitely not.
willow_rosenberg Oh, not me, I, I was just saying, a pretty girl like that, there's always someone lurking around, looking for some action.
spike Small world. Oh dear. If looks could stake. You having fun, pet? You ... trolling for your next ex? I gotta say, you can do better.
buffy_summers I told you, I wa-
spike Thought I was gonna leave town? It's a free country. Free party. If you want me to leave, you can put your hands on my hot, tight little body and make me.
buffy_summers Get away from me.
ben Was that guy bothering you? Should I, um, offer to get inappropriately violent or something?
buffy_summers No.
ben Good, 'cause, honestly, I don't wanna.
buffy_summers So, are you ready to dance?
ben Um, first...
buffy_summers What's that?
ben Uh, yeah, my phone number. I was gonna try to subtly work it into the conversation, but it didn't pan out, and I thought I should try to give it to you before you see me dance.
ben You know, in case you wanna get coffee.
buffy_summers Thank you. Um, I, I just, I-I think you should know that I ... I kind of have this bad history in which, you know, we go get coffee, and, well, it all ends with, with you leaving town, and you just got here and everything...
ben Apparently we'd be risking a tragic chain reaction, but ... I just really like ... coffee. I think coffee might be worth it. And I would like to get to know ... coffee better.
buffy_summers Then I'll call you.
april Have you seen Warren?
GIRL#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 No, sorry.
spike And who are you, darlin'?
april I'm April.
april I'm looking for my fella.
spike Maybe you just found him.
april Really? Where?
april Oh!
spike Hey! Hey! Hey!
april That would be wrong. You are not my boyfriend!
spike Bloody hell! You threw me through a window!
spike What's that about?
april You do not make those suggestions to me. I have a boyfriend. Warren is my boyfriend.
spike You know what? My bleeding sympathies to Warren.
april No one but Warren can touch me.
buffy_summers Excuse me. Hi. Um, uh, maybe you and I could talk. You know, 'cause, throwing Spike through a window, well, that's really good... um, but, you know, generally speaking-
april Do you know my boyfriend?
buffy_summers Okay. I think you need to take a second and stop looking for your boyfriend.
april I have to find him.
april If I hurt you just now, I'm sorry. And I hope that your boyfriend will take good care of you.
buffy_summers Ow. I don't know about you guys, but I've had it with super-strong little women who aren't me.
tara_maclay Well, at least she didn't do too much damage.
xander_harris Are you kidding? Double-glazed windows ain't cheap. And the jamb needs to be completely repaired. Oh dear god, I'm the grownup who sees the world through my job. I'm like my uncle Dave the plumber. I must be shunned.
willow_rosenberg Okay.
buffy_summers So, what do you guys think she is? I mean, this may sound nuts, but I kinda got the impression that she was a-
tara_maclay Robot.
xander_harris Oh yeah, robot.
buffy_summers Yeah, I was gonna say robot. What do you think she wants?
tara_maclay Warren, whoever that is.
xander_harris It's gotta be the guy that built her.
willow_rosenberg It's an unusual name. There's hardly any except ... Warren Beatty and, you know, President Harding. It-it's probably not either of them.
buffy_summers Will, can you track down this guy with only a first name?
willow_rosenberg Given enough time. I can get a list of the Sunnydale students named Warren tonight, but ... then we'll have to call them or go to their dorms, so we probably can't start narrowing it down till tomorrow.
anya She could do a lot of damage by then.
xander_harris To who, Spike? See how vigorously I don't care. She was looking for this Warren, but it didn't sound like she wanted to hurt him. She said he's her boyfriend.
willow_rosenberg I agree. I'm not sure this is a code red. Hey, is there a code pink? We need more codes.
buffy_summers Okay. We'll track down Warren tomorrow. Tonight I better go rescue Giles. He's been watching Dawn while my mom's out on her date, and I have a feeling there's only so much he can take.
tara_maclay Oh, Giles and Dawnie? I bet they ended up having a blast.
rupert_giles Dear god, Buffy, there's only so much I can take. We're going to have to change the system. A fourteen-year-old's too old to be babysat, and it's not fair on her.
buffy_summers What'd she make you do?
rupert_giles Um, well, we listened to aggressively cheerful music sung by people chosen for their ability to dance ... then we ate cookie dough and talked about boys.
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I'm very very sorry, but if it makes you feel any better, my fun time Buffy party night involved watching a robot throw Spike through a window, so if you wanna trade... No ... wait ... I wouldn't give that memory up for anything.
rupert_giles A robot? Sounds interesting.
buffy_summers We're gonna work on it in the morning. I mean, unless you wanna stay for a while, and then you and I could-
joyce_summers Who wants to hear everything?
buffy_summers ...listen to my mom talk about boys.
rupert_giles Right, must go. See you tomorrow. Bye Joyce.
joyce_summers Bye Rupert.
joyce_summers Gosh, I'd forgotten how much fun dating can be.
buffy_summers I don't know. I was standing right here. I didn't see Prince Charming. I didn't even see a goodnight kiss.
buffy_summers It all looked pretty tame to me.
joyce_summers Well, I suppose by your standards it could seem pretty ... Oh dear.
buffy_summers What?
joyce_summers I left my bra in his car.
buffy_summers Mother!
joyce_summers I'm joking.
buffy_summers Good god, that's horrible. Don't do that.
joyce_summers I left it in the restaurant.
buffy_summers No more! No more! No more!
joyce_summers On the dessert cart!
buffy_summers I can't hear you!
SLEEPY_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Yeah? What?
april Hi! Does Warren live here?
SLEEPY_GUY#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 What the hell - what are you doing, it's 3:30!
april Yes, it is! Does Warren live here?
april Okay then. Bye.
rupert_giles And you're certain she was a robot?
buffy_summers Absolutely.
tara_maclay Well, she practically had Genuine Molded Plastic stamped on her ass.
tara_maclay Just ... tryin' a little spicy talk.
anya She was looking for someone named Warren.
buffy_summers Willow's already checked the Sunnydale enrollment.
willow_rosenberg And got nothin'. I found one Warren, but he moved out of the country a year ago. I'm checking nearby schools.
xander_harris Whoever he is, he knows his stuff. That girl, well... that was a nice-lookin' girl.
anya It's okay for him to say that, 'cause I know that he really loves me only.
rupert_giles Is there something the rest of us could be doing?
xander_harris What can we do?
tara_maclay Oh, do you have any books on robots?
rupert_giles Oh, yes, dozens. There's an enormous amount of research we should do before - no, I'm lying. I haven't got squat, I just like to see Xander squirm.
xander_harris Funny. Charming and funny.
willow_rosenberg Hey! I think I found him. A Warren Mears. He went to Sunnydale High with us for a semester, and then he went to the tech college over in Dutton. I've got a local address where his folks still live.
tara_maclay He's probably home for spring break.
buffy_summers Well, I'll go talk to him.
rupert_giles No no no no no, wait, we don't know what you're walking into. Uh, we have no idea what his motive is for building this thing.
tara_maclay Um ... don't you think se's just...
willow_rosenberg Yeah ... she's just sort of a...
xander_harris She's a sexbot. I mean, what guy doesn't dream about that?
xander_harris Beautiful girl with ... no other thought but to please you ... willing to do anything...
xander_harris Too many girls. I miss Oz. He'd get it. He wouldn't say anything, but... he'd get it.
anya Why would anyone do that if they could have a real live person?
willow_rosenberg Maybe he couldn't. Find a real person.
buffy_summers Oh, come on. The guy's just a big wedge of sleaze, don't make excuses for him.
willow_rosenberg I'm not, I'm just saying, people get lonely, and maybe having someone around, even someone you made up ... maybe it's easier.
tara_maclay But it's so weird. I mean, everyone wants a nice normal person to share with, but this guy, if he couldn't find that, I guess it's ... kinda sad.
ben Hello?
buffy_summers Hey. Ben, it, it's Buffy. Is this a bad time? I know it's kinda early.
ben No, I just ... I just got in is all. Night shift at the hospital. I'm glad you called.
buffy_summers Well, I found your number in my pocket, and, you know, figured I'd pick up the phone a couple of times, and then hang up, and then finally call, and see if maybe you wanted to get that cup of coffee, or...
ben Yeah, yes. Coffee would be great. ... Tomorrow night? Sure. Bye.
ben Fine.
katrina_silber But we just got here. If you don't wanna be here, why didn't we just stay in Dutton? Or we could have gone to my sister's.
warren_meers Katrina, I don't wanna hear about your sister's place again. Pack your stuff now.
katrina_silber Why the rush? It's real early. Are we even gonna say goodbye to your mom?
warren_meers Uh, you can call her.
katrina_silber Warren. Is something going on you don't want me to see?
warren_meers Katrina, um, if you don't wanna pack, that's fine. We can buy new stuff. Now let's just go!
buffy_summers I have to talk to you.
katrina_silber Who's this?
warren_meers Is this about her?
buffy_summers Yes.
katrina_silber Her who? Warren, something's going on here. Strange girls...
warren_meers Katrina, please be quiet, okay, this is important. Wait in the kitchen.
katrina_silber And I'm not important? Warren, just tell her to go away.
warren_meers I can't.
katrina_silber You're keeping secrets from me. Other girls, and who knows what else?
warren_meers Trina, shut up.
katrina_silber That's it. Forget it, Warren. I'm gone.
warren_meers No, Katrina! Ahhh....
buffy_summers My name is Buffy Summers. We were at Sunnydale High together. Do you know who I am?
warren_meers Yes, I know. Um, April, did she hurt someone?
buffy_summers Not yet. Well, no one that matters.
warren_meers She's looking for me. You know, uh, she followed me here.
buffy_summers Okay, kind of figured that out.
warren_meers No, no, there's more. Uh, there's something you need to know about her.
buffy_summers I know.
warren_meers No, wait, this is important.
buffy_summers Believe me, I, I worked it out.
warren_meers No, this is something, uh, that you can't possibly know.
warren_meers She's a robot.
buffy_summers Uh-huh.
dawn_summers A robot? Really? Was it Ted? 'Cause I always said there could have been more than one of him.
willow_rosenberg Nope, whole new robot. This one was a girl.
xander_harris Buffy's busy tracking down the guy that made her, so I'll drop you off at school, and if she's not finished, then-
spike Coming through! Coming through.
spike Fire! Fire!
spike Hello, all. What's going on then?
rupert_giles Spike, you're not welcome here.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, and by the way, we're working on a way to de-invite you from here. Even if it is a public place.
xander_harris Nah, forget it. Letting him in is good, 'cause then we get to toss him out.
anya Ooh, can we throw him out the window like the robot did? 'Cause that was neat.
spike Robot? That's what she was? Knew something wasn't right. Hey. Someone's glad to see me, aren't you, little bit?
dawn_summers Stay away from me.
tara_maclay I think you better go.
spike Okay, now, I was afraid of this. Misrepresentations, misunderstandings, slurs and allegations. I don't know what Buffy told you, but the thing is, the Slayer and I worked together, side by side, to get rid of Dru. Who was up to no good. And I don't mind telling you-
rupert_giles Spike ... listen to me.
spike It's just ... I'm trying to explain. She might have said some things that sounded like I expressed some kind of feeling-
rupert_giles We are not your friends. We are not your way to Buffy. There is no way to Buffy.
rupert_giles Clear out of here. And Spike, this thing ... get over it.
spike I don't know what you mean.
rupert_giles Yes, you do. Move the hell on.
april I'm looking for my boyfriend Warren.
COFFEE_GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 What?
april He comes from here and I need him. But ... it's confusing, and I've already walked a really long way. I'm sure he's nearby.
COFFEE_GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Oh, Warren! You're looking for Warren?
april Yes! Do you know him? Do you know where he is?
COFFEE_GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Man, let me think.
april Please think.
COFFEE_GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Geez, this is too bad, you, you just missed him.
april Yes? Where did he go?
COFFEE_GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Warren? Uh, he headed out. Uh, that way. Hurry, you might catch him.
april Oh, thank you. I was getting very tired. Thank you.
COFFEE_GUY_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Who's Warren?
COFFEE_GUY_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode15 Hell if I know.
buffy_summers So you have girl troubles.
buffy_summers They're not talking to you, you're not gettin' dates ... you start thinking, hey, this isn't fair.
warren_meers Yeah, I mean, I felt like I deserved to have someone. You know, I mean, everyone deserves to have someone.
buffy_summers So naturally you turned to manufacturing.
warren_meers Kinda.
buffy_summers And how long did it take to build yourself that little toy?
warren_meers Oh, no, she's not a toy. I mean, I know what you're thinking, but she's more than that.
buffy_summers I'm sure she has many exciting labor-saving attachments.
warren_meers No, I made her to love me.
warren_meers I mean, she cares about what I care about, and she wants to be with me. She listens to me and supports me.
warren_meers I didn't make a toy. I made a girlfriend.
buffy_summers A girlfriend. Are you saying ... are you in love with her?
warren_meers I really thought I would be.
warren_meers I mean, she's perfect. I don't know, I ... I guess it was too easy. And predictable.
warren_meers You know, she got boring. She was exactly what I wanted, and I didn't want her. I thought I was going crazy.
buffy_summers Really? You?
warren_meers Then something happened. Katrina was in my engineering seminar, and she was really funny and cool. You know, she was always givin' me a hard time, real ... unpredictable. She builds these little model monorails that run with magnets, and ... Anyway. I fell in love with Katrina.
buffy_summers Swell. Romance and magnetic trains. But first you decided to take April out of the box...
buffy_summers ...play with her for five minutes, and then what? You got bored, decided to dump her, tell her to go away?
warren_meers Kinda.
buffy_summers And she got mad. She didn't go, huh?
warren_meers Okay, I didn't really dump her, as much as I, uh, went out, and, uh, didn't come back. I left her, I ... left her in my dorm room.
buffy_summers You left her in your dorm room?!
warren_meers Well, I figured I could just kinda get away until her batteries gave out. Which should have been days ago.
buffy_summers Did you even tell her? I mean, did you even give her a chance to fix what was wrong?
warren_meers I didn't need to fix anything. I mean, her batteries were supposed to run down. Really, they should be completely dead by now.
buffy_summers So why aren't they?
warren_meers I don't, I don't know. I mean, maybe ... uh, she must be recharging them somehow.
buffy_summers Warren, this is important. Is she dangerous?
warren_meers She's only programmed to be in love.
buffy_summers Then she's dangerous. Do you have any idea how to find her?
warren_meers Well, she's looking for me, so my guess is she's probably pretty close.
april Hi!
april Do you know where Warren is? I need to get to Warren.
katrina_silber This is getting insane, how many of you are there?
april There's only me. April.
katrina_silber April. Fine. Listen up, April. Warren is my boyfriend. Mine. And you others probably oughta figure that out.
katrina_silber Ow. Ow! Let go!
april Don't go. You have to stay and tell the truth.
april You're lying. He cannot be your boyfriend. Say that he's my boyfriend.
katrina_silber I can't ... I can't breathe. Let go!
april You have to stop lying.
spike Bloody right, I'll move on.
warren_meers April! April, are you there? If the batteries are still working and she hears my voice, then ... she'll answer.
buffy_summers She's voice-activated?
warren_meers Well, I made it so that if she heard me and she didn't answer, it causes this kind of feedback.
buffy_summers Wait, if you call her and she doesn't answer, it hurts her? You're one creepy little dweeb, Warren.
warren_meers April!
april Warren!
warren_meers April.
april Where have you been? I couldn't find you, and this girl kept lying to me, and ... then she went to sleep.
warren_meers April, what did you do?
april Please don't be angry, Warren. I'm trying very hard to make you happy.
buffy_summers April. I want you to put the girl down.
april Warren? What should I do?
buffy_summers Talk to her!
warren_meers Pu-put her down!
april Okay.
warren_meers This is Buffy. Give Katrina to Buffy.
april Is she broken?
buffy_summers She's alive.
april Warren, honey, what's going on? Why did you go away? Is it a game?
warren_meers No. No, this isn't a game.
april Did I do something wrong? I waited a long time and you never came back. A long time. I made you five sweaters.
warren_meers That's great, you could go back and get them. So you could wait there, and-
buffy_summers Warren! You have to tell her. And do it right.
april What is she saying, Warren? What do you need to tell me?
warren_meers April, I made a mistake.
april You can't make mistakes.
warren_meers No, I did.
warren_meers I thought that I made you everything that I wanted, but it wasn't really what I wanted.
warren_meers I'm sorry, bu-but it's over.
april But ... I can be whatever you want. I love you. I'll do whatever you want. Would you like a neckrub?
warren_meers No, hey, no. See, I - I know that you love me, but the truth is, I can't love you. I mean, it's not your fault, but...
warren_meers I don't love you.
warren_meers I love her!
buffy_summers She growls? You made her so she growls?
warren_meers Well...
katrina_silber What's going on?
warren_meers No, no, Trina-
warren_meers Get away.
katrina_silber What is ... what ... that's a robot!
warren_meers She wasn't just for sex.
katrina_silber Is that ... is that your ex-girlfriend?
warren_meers I...
katrina_silber No, get the hell away from me!
warren_meers No, no, no, Trina, no, Trina, wait...
april You took my man. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to ... I can't ... can't crush! So ... tired.
april Warren? Where are you? What's happening to me?
buffy_summers Can you cry? Sometimes I feel better when I cry. But ... there might be rust issues.
april Crying is blackmail. Good girlfriends don't cry.
buffy_summers Oh.
april I rechecked everything. I did everything I was supposed to do. I was a good girlfriend.
buffy_summers I'm sure you were.
april I'm only supposed to love him. If I can't do that, what am I for? What do I exist for?
buffy_summers I don't know. It isn't fair. He wasn't fair to you.
april It's getting dark.
april It's so early to be dark.
buffy_summers Yeah.
april What if he comes back and he can't find me in the dark?
buffy_summers I'm here. I'll make sure that he finds you.
april Maybe this is a girlfriend test. If I wait here patiently this time, he'll come back.
buffy_summers I'm sure he will. And he'll ... he'll tell you how sorry he is. You know, he told me ... how proud he was of you and ... how impressed he was with how much you loved him and how you tried to help him. He didn't mean to hurt you.
april He's going to take me home, and things will be right again.
buffy_summers It'll be fine.
april When things are sad ... you just have to be patient. Because ... because every ... cloud has a silver lining. And ... when life ... gives you lemons ... make ... lemonade.
buffy_summers Clouds and lemonade, huh?
april Yes. And ... and ... things are ... always ... darkest ... before....
xander_harris See, you construct the wood jamb and frame the glass into it, and that's what you set into the opening.
buffy_summers Yeah?
xander_harris One of the cool things about that, you see is, uh, the jamb can be shimmed to be square, even if the opening isn't.
buffy_summers Shimmed? Is that even a real word? Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
xander_harris Yeah, I do. Scary, isn't it? I think I've actually turned into someone you want around after a crazed robot attack.
buffy_summers And if you ever start your own business, you have your slogan right there. And she wasn't crazed.
xander_harris Yeah?)
buffy_summers She devoted everything to making this one person happy. And then it was like, with him gone, there was just ... no reason for her to exist any more.
xander_harris Robots are the strangest people.
buffy_summers No ... people are the strangest people. I mean, look at me obsessing about being with someone. It's like ... I don't need a guy right now. I need me. I need to get comfortable being alone with Buffy.
xander_harris Well, I'll say this, she's a pretty cool person to be alone with.
buffy_summers Thank you.
buffy_summers Hi, it's Buffy. Um, I hope this is your machine, there, there wasn't a message. Anyway, um, about coffee. I, um ... I just ... I don't think this is the best time for me to be ... drinking...
buffy_summers ...coffee. Um, I'm sorry. And, um, bye.
glory What the hell?
jinx If I may, your inconceivableness, it sounds to these humble ears like our Ben tried to make a date with the Slayer.
glory A date with the Slayer? No. No. No, no, no. He is planning something, he's working against me.
glory She turned us down?
warren_meers Trina, no, wait, listen, listen, I'm so sorry. I guess I asked- No, no, just give me a chance to explain, I ... Yes! No, but she - no, no, listen, listen, I'll do anything, just, no, no, don't hang up!
warren_meers How, how'd you get in here?
spike Your mum let me in. I'm placing an order.
warren_meers Oh, no, no, I'm not making any more girls.
spike Sure you are. Here's your specs.
spike You're gonna make her real good for me.
buffy_summers Hey, Mom.
buffy_summers Ooh.
buffy_summers Still a couple of guys gettin' it right.
buffy_summers Hey. Flower-gettin' lady. Want me to pick Dawn up from school?
buffy_summers Mom?
buffy_summers What are you doing?
buffy_summers Mom? Mom? Mommy?
