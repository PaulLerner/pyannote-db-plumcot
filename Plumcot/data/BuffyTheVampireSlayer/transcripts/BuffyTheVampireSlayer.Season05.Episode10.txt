buffy_summers Riley!
riley_finn Know you got a lot on your mind. You decide you wanna let me in on any of it, you let me know.
rupert_giles Previously on
riley_finn Buffy's like nobody else in the world. But she doesn't love me.
spike Buffy, I love you.
spike Oh God, no.
DOCTOR_VOICEOVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 Your mother has ... a brain tumor.
rupert_giles Just me. Sorry. Can I get you anything?
buffy_summers No, thank you.
rupert_giles Riley?
riley_finn No, I'm fine.
willow_rosenberg What time is it?
xander_harris There's a clock behind you, Will.
willow_rosenberg I know, but there's a watch right above your hand.
willow_rosenberg That can't be right. Oh.
buffy_summers I can't stand this. What's taking so long?
riley_finn It doesn't mean anything.
buffy_summers You think?
riley_finn I'd worry more if your mom was out of surgery quickly. Might mean that, you know, they couldn't do much.
dr_kriegel Okay, your mom's in recovery.
buffy_summers What happened, is she all right?
dr_kriegel It was possible to visualize the tumor completely, which means I was able to get all of it. So, barring complications in recovery ... I think your mother's going to be fine. Of course we're still going to have to watch your mother carefully, and, uh, have her back in here for some follow-up testing, but, uh, overall I'd consider the procedure a complete success.
buffy_summers Oh my goodness, doctor, thank you, thank you so much.
dr_kriegel Please, it's my pleasure.
buffy_summers Sorry. Sorry!
dawn_summers When I was younger, I used to put my chopsticks in my mouth like this, and then Buffy would chase me around the house yelling, 'I'm the slayer, I'm going to get you!'
anya That's disturbing. You're emotionally scarred and will end up badly.
dawn_summers No, it was great. I mean, she didn't actually stake me in the heart, you know.
xander_harris Buffy's pretty cool like that. So, what do you wanna do now, Dawnster? Keeping in mind that I won't chase you because I'm old and I'm stuffed full of moo goo gai starch.
anya Well, we could play that game again, Life. That was fun.
dawn_summers For you. You always win.
anya Well ... we can make a wager this time. You can give me real money. That would be different.
xander_harris And after we teach her to gamble, maybe we can all get drunk!
anya I don't think the bar would serve her, but we could bring something in. Strawberry schnapps taste just like real ice cream.
xander_harris Okay, how's about a movie? They're showing them in theaters now. I hear it's like watching a video with a bunch of strangers and a sticky floor.
dawn_summers That one looks sad.
xander_harris The chimp playing hockey? Is that based on the Chekhov?
anya There's a chimp playing hockey?
dawn_summers Um, no, the other one. I don't wanna see a sad movie.
anya We have to see the chimp playing hockey! That's hilarious! The ice is so slippery, and, and monkeys are all irrational. We have to see this.
xander_harris You pick, Dawn. This is your night. We are celebrating your mom's good news.
anya Go monkey. Choose monkey.
dawn_summers It's okay. You guys don't have to make a big deal for me. I'm only sleeping over here so Buffy and Riley can boink.
xander_harris No, that's not, that's not it at all, they just need time to, uh... be tender. Relax.
anya He's not very convincing, is he?
dawn_summers 'Alone time' always translates into 'get Dawn out of the house so we can have loud obnoxious sex.'
anya Oh, does that mean we can't?
buffy_summers Can we put this song on repeat?
riley_finn Whatever you want.
buffy_summers Can we put the whole night on repeat?
riley_finn Absolutely.
buffy_summers Good. Mm, I can't believe how relaxed I feel. It's like all the tension's just left my body.
riley_finn Oh, really? 'Cause I had that scheduled for a little later on.
buffy_summers Scheduled? Are you planning on seducing me, Mr. Finn?
riley_finn Always.
riley_finn I want tonight to be special for you.
buffy_summers It's more than special. It's perfect.
riley_finn Well, I'm glad. You deserve it after everything you've been through.
buffy_summers Well, it's nothing compared to what my mom had to deal with.
riley_finn It was a lot. And you were incredible.
buffy_summers Not really. Just covering for the weepy chicken within.
riley_finn Don't sell yourself short. You stayed strong throughout, Buffy. You never even cried.
buffy_summers Oh, I cried. I cried so hard, I didn't think I was gonna be able to stop.
riley_finn Oh.
buffy_summers That's all in the past now. Mom's out of the woods, and I'm here with you. That's all that matters.
joyce_summers I don't know, Buffy. I think I'll look like I have a cat on my head.
buffy_summers But a very well-groomed cat.
joyce_summers I think maybe I'll ... stick with a scarf.
buffy_summers Come on, wigs are fun. We can get you a whole bunch of different ones. You know, you can be, like, Sixties Mom, Action Mom... French Maid Mom...
joyce_summers I must be getting better, 'cause you're making fun of me.
buffy_summers Well, you know. Got a lot of time to make up for.
joyce_summers You have more important things to make up. I know you've been missing a lot of school.
buffy_summers I may have to take a few incompletes, but I will make it through the semester.
joyce_summers Well, what about slaying and your friends? I want you to have your life back.
buffy_summers Right now I'd rather be here, styling your beautiful new plastic dream hair.
joyce_summers Fair enough, but you don't have to keep me company all night. Go out, have fun, get, get Riley to take you to a movie or something.
buffy_summers I gave Riley the day off.
joyce_summers I don't think he thinks of you as a chore, Buffy.
buffy_summers I know that. Look, I told him to make plans with his friends because I wanted to have you all to myself, okay? Besides, I can see him any time. And I'm sure he'll come over later looking for a little... bible study.
joyce_summers Well, good. I mean, just as long as the two of you are spending some quality time with ... the lord.
buffy_summers We are. Absolutely.
major_ellis What've we got?
graham_miller Belize. Last transmission. Infra-red scans say they're-
major_ellis Breeding. They're not gonna stay in that village for long. Looks like we got ourselves a hot spot. Tell the men to get ready.
graham_miller What about Riley? Agent Finn. I'm telling you, sir, if we go in for a sweep and drop, he's definitely a guy we want on the team.
major_ellis Well, let's bring him on board.
graham_miller It, uh, might take a little convincing.
major_ellis Why? What's he got here in Sunnydale that's so special?
buffy_summers Riley?
spike It's me.
buffy_summers Every time you show up like this, you risk all of your parts, you know that?
spike I wouldn't be here if I didn't have a good reason. As usual, I'm here to help you, and I - are you naked under there?
buffy_summers Get out.
spike No, I'm serious. I mean, not about the naked part, I mean...
buffy_summers Get out or I will drop you out head-first.
spike I wanna show you something.
buffy_summers What?
spike You need to see this.
spike But we need to move if we wanna get there in time.
spike Oh, please! Like I give a bloody damn.
spike Don't stop, Slayer. This isn't what we're here for.
VAMP_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 What do you think you're doing?
spike Just having a little look, mate. Keep it down.
VAMP_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 You can't go up there.
spike I said keep it down.
riley_finn Harder.
riley_finn Buffy.
riley_finn Buffy!
spike We only came here because we care about you, friend. You need help.
VAMP_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 Hey. Hey, hey.
spike I thought you should know-
VAMP_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 Was that the slayer? What the hell do you think you're doing bringing the slayer here?
riley_finn Back off, man. I didn't know.
VAMP_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 Nobody's gonna risk coming here now!
riley_finn I said back off!
riley_finn Get out.
major_ellis I need to talk to you.
riley_finn I'm not in a talkin' mood.
major_ellis Then listen.
graham_miller Riley, just give the man a chance. You don't like what you hear, we'll be on our way.
riley_finn Talk fast.
major_ellis We have a Code One in Belize. A demon tribe is taking apart missionaries in the rain forest down there.
riley_finn And you're telling me this because?
major_ellis We're going down to terminate their operation. We want you to join us.
riley_finn I'm a civilian.
major_ellis You're a soldier.
riley_finn I quit the government a long way back.
major_ellis We're not government. We're army.
graham_miller Just like you.
major_ellis It's not the Initiative, Finn. We don't do experiments. None of us give a damn what makes monsters tick. We just stop 'em.
riley_finn What do you need me for?
major_ellis I think you can handle yourself. And I always need bodies. I'm not gonna lie to you. It's the real deal. High risk, low pay, and seriously messy. We ship out for Central America tomorrow midnight. Now maybe civilian life is working out for you... and maybe not. Midnight. Tomorrow. The decision's yours.
rupert_giles And so it begins.
rupert_giles No longer a victim of crass holiday commercialization, I'm ... a purveyor of it.
anya Oh. Who ordered more chickens' feet? The ones we have aren't moving at all.
xander_harris That's generally what happens when you cut them off the chicken.
anya I'm serious. Maybe we could do a ... holiday promotion. One free with every purchase!
rupert_giles Oh, yeah. Dear holiday memories. Merry tykes by the fire, enjoying their new Christmas ... chicken feet.
willow_rosenberg Aw, holding them tight as they fall asleep. Painting their little toenails.
anya That's so very humorous. Make fun of the ex-demon! I can just hear you in private. 'I dislike that Anya. She's newly human and strangely literal.'
willow_rosenberg Anya, I don't say that. No one says that. No one talks that way.
anya There's nothing wrong with my idea anyway. I've been very good for this store. If it wasn't for me, Giles would be a terrified old man staring at a quarterly tax statement and wetting himself.
rupert_giles I say, that's an exaggeration.
willow_rosenberg Anya, you've helped out a lot, but I have too.
anya Yes, I forgot about all the vigorous sitting around.
xander_harris Anya, you can back off a little. You get paid. Willow's doing this on her own time.
anya I'm sorry, Willow. Thank you for making time in your busy life to come in here and get in the way of mine.
xander_harris Anya, play nice.
anya You know, fine, take her side instead of mine even though I'm the one who sleeps with you and feeds you, bathes you...
willow_rosenberg She bathes you?
xander_harris Only in an erotic, Penthouse-y way, not in a sponge-bath-y geriatric sort of...
rupert_giles Please! Stop, I beg of you.
buffy_summers I need to find out everything I can about a vamp nest downtown.
rupert_giles A nest? What sort of-
buffy_summers There were people there. It, um, it looked like they were paying vampires to bite them.
xander_harris *Now* I know what to get for the person who has everything!
willow_rosenberg Who would pay to get bitten?
anya Oh, that's been going on for centuries. Humans hire vampires to feed off them, they, well, you know, they-they get off on the rush.
rupert_giles And the ... hazards of the underworld can become addictive to ... some people.
xander_harris Why don't the vampires just kill 'em?
anya Because they get cash, hot and cold running blood, and ... they don't leave any corpses behind so they don't get hunted.
rupert_giles But still, i-it can be terribly dangerous for humans. I mean, people can end up dying accidentally, or, or meeting a, a vampire who only pretends to play by the house rules.
buffy_summers You knew about this and you didn't tell me?
rupert_giles I hadn't seen it since my Ripper days. I had no idea it was going on in Sunnydale.
buffy_summers Well, it is. And I'm gonna stop it.
rupert_giles Buffy, even if I had known about this, I might not have told you right now.
buffy_summers What? Why?
rupert_giles Well, I'm not sure this is where your efforts are best spent. Perhaps you should focus on ... a less ambiguous evil. Glory, for instance?
buffy_summers You said people are dying.
rupert_giles They're willing victims. I mean, there are people out there who deserve your help who aren't.
buffy_summers Vampires are vampires. And my job description is pretty clear. Are you coming with me or not?
xander_harris What's the rush, Buff? If we're going into a nest, maybe we should come up with a strategy. Wait for Riley.
buffy_summers Back me up or not. I'm going.
rupert_giles Anya, will you mind the store?
anya Have a nice day! Don't get killed.
buffy_summers I don't understand. This place was doing serious business last night.
xander_harris Well, I guess everybody jumped ship once the word got out that the slayer found their crib. I just want to apologize for the use of the word 'crib.'
buffy_summers Do you think they'll set up shop again in town?
rupert_giles It's hard to say. I'm sure they'll lie low for a bit.
buffy_summers But they're around somewhere. There's gotta be a way to find these creeps.
willow_rosenberg Don't worry, Buff, you'll find them.
xander_harris Yeah, I'm sure you'll get them next time, champ.
spike What took you? Guess it takes a while to get back to full strength after those bites.
spike Hey! Hey, let's be reasonable about this.
riley_finn You may have noticed, Spike, I left reasonable about three exits back.
spike Look, I'm not the one who got you into this. Don't kill the messenger.
riley_finn Why the hell not?
spike Ow! Bloody hell! Oh god! Hey.
riley_finn Plastic wood-grain. Looks real, doesn't it? Don't think I don't know what's goin' on with you, Spike. Stay away from her. Or we'll do this for real next time.
spike Oh, man. You are really under it, aren't you?
riley_finn What?
spike Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey.
riley_finn Because you are.
spike Well ... yeah. But that's not your problem. Even if I wasn't in the picture, you're never gonna be able to hold onto her.
spike Ow, bloody hell!
riley_finn Maybe I didn't almost kill you enough.
spike Come on. You're not the long haul guy and you know it.
riley_finn Shut up.
spike You know it. Or else you wouldn't be getting suck jobs from two-bit vampire trulls.
spike The girl needs some monster in her man ... and that's not in your nature... ...no matter how low you try to go.
riley_finn You actually think you've got a shot with her?
spike No, I don't. Fella's gotta try, though. Gotta do what he can.RILEY: If you touched her... you know I'd kill you for real.
spike I had this chip outta my head, I'da killed you long ago. Ain't love grand?
spike Sometimes I envy you so much it chokes me. And sometimes I think I got the better deal. To be that close to her and not have her. To be all alone even when you're holding her. Feeling her, feeling her beneath you. Surrounding you. The scent ... No, you got the better deal.
riley_finn I'm the lucky guy. Yeah.
riley_finn I'm the guy.
xander_harris How long has she been in there?
anya A while now. Seems pretty gung-ho about it too. Didn't even stop to say hello.
xander_harris Yeah, when we went to deal with that vampire nest, she got all Rambo and torched the place. Something seriously bad is going on with her.
anya Oh, I don't know, maybe you're overreacting. I mean, who hasn't done stuff like that from time to time? I mean, I made this one guy spontaneously combust, and he set his whole village on fire.
xander_harris Can you stop being scary for a minute and listen to what I'm trying to tell you?
riley_finn She in there?
xander_harris She's training.
riley_finn Would you guys mind clearing out? I need a minute alone with her.
anya A little after-hours hanky-panky in the training room, huh? Boy, Xander and I could tell you some stories...
xander_harris Not now. Let's go, Anya.
anya There's a funny thing with the vaulting horse that you can tr...
xander_harris Anya!
anya What? He started it.
xander_harris In your world, maybe, but where the people are, this isn't the time for 'Tales of Anya and Xander's Sexcapades.'
anya Oh. Uh, well, maybe we can go home and, you know, have 'em.
xander_harris Actually, I've got some stuff to take care of.
riley_finn We need to talk.
buffy_summers I'm not ready to talk to you yet.
riley_finn Too bad.
buffy_summers I'm serious. Unless you wanna fight.
riley_finn So let's fight. We need to have this out, Buffy. Right now.
buffy_summers And say what, Riley? 'What were you thinking? How long have you been lying to me?' Nothing you say right now is gonna make this better.
riley_finn I realize that. I don't expect... I just need you to hear me out.
buffy_summers Fine. Get your hand off of me.
riley_finn I think, when this thing started, it was just some stupid, immature game. I wanted to even the score after you let Dracula bite you.
buffy_summers I did not *let* Dracula-
riley_finn I know. On some level I know that. But I was still spun. I don't know, I - I wanted to know what you felt. I wanted to know why Dracula and Angel have so much power over you.
buffy_summers You so don't get it.
riley_finn I wanted to get it, Buffy. I wanted to get you.
buffy_summers So this is my fault? Hey, gee, Buffy's so mysterious, I think I'll go out and almost die. I think I'll go and let some other w...
riley_finn This isn't your fault. It's mine. I feel like hell for what I've put you through. It's just... these girls-
buffy_summers Vampires. Killers.
riley_finn They made me feel something, Buffy. Something I didn't even know I was missing until-
buffy_summers I can't. I can't hear this.
riley_finn You *need* to hear this.
buffy_summers Fine. Fine! Tell me about your whores! Tell me what on earth they were giving you that I can't.
riley_finn They needed me.
buffy_summers They needed your money. It wasn't about you.
riley_finn No. On some basic level it *was* about me. My blood, my body. When they bit me ... it was beyond passion. They wanted to devour me, all of me.
buffy_summers Why are you telling me this?
riley_finn It wasn't real. I know, it was just physical. But the fact that I craved it ... that, that I kept going back ... even if it was fleeting, they made me feel like they had such... hunger for me.
buffy_summers And I don't ... make you feel that way? How on earth can you compare me to that? How can you tell me you understand what those vampires are feeling? You aren't a passion to them, you are a snack! A willing, idiotic snack.
riley_finn No, I know exactly what they feel when they bite me, because I feel it every time we're together. It's like the whole world falls away. And all there is is you.
buffy_summers And you think that I don't feel the same way about you? How dare you tell me what I feel?
riley_finn You keep me at a distance, Buffy. You didn't even call me when your mom went into the hospital.
buffy_summers Oh, I'm sorry. You know, um, I'm sorry that I couldn't take care of you when I thought that my mother was dying.
riley_finn It's about me taking care of you! It's about letting me in. So you don't have to be on top of everything all the time.
buffy_summers But I do. That's part of what being a slayer is. And that's what this is really about, isn't it? You can't handle the fact that I'm stronger than you.
riley_finn It's hard sometimes, yeah. But that's not it.
buffy_summers Then what? What else do you want from me, Riley? I've given you everything that I have, I've given you my heart, my body and soul!
riley_finn You say that, but I don't feel it. I just don't feel it.
buffy_summers Well, whose fault its that? Because I'm telling you, this is it, this is me. This is the package. And if it's so deficient that you need to get your kicks elsewhere ... then we really have a problem.
riley_finn They want me back, Buffy ... the military. It's deep undercover, no contact with civilians. Transport's leaving tonight.
buffy_summers Tonight? When were you gonna tell me about this?
riley_finn I'm telling you now.
buffy_summers Are you going?
riley_finn I don't know. If we can't work this out...
buffy_summers Then what? This is goodbye? You are unbelievable. You're giving me an ultimatum?
riley_finn No, I'm not.
buffy_summers Yes you are! You expect me to get over it now or you're gone!
riley_finn I don't, Buffy, that's not what I meant.
buffy_summers Well, I have heard enough. I will not take the blame for this.
riley_finn I'm not asking you to.
buffy_summers Let go of me!
riley_finn Or what? You'll hit me? Go ahead. Come on, do it.
buffy_summers Get out of my way.
riley_finn I'm serious, Buffy, hit me. Hit me.
riley_finn I'm leaving, Buffy.
riley_finn Unless you give me a reason to stay ... I'm leaving tonight.
VAMP2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 The pyro act was a bad idea, slayer.
buffy_summers Felt pretty good to me.
VAMP2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 I'm not running. And you're not shutting me down.
VAMP2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode10 In fact ... you're not gonna make it through the night.Blackout.
buffy_summers Walk away. I'm serious. Don't do this. Not now.
xander_harris So, how'd that work out for ya?
xander_harris Make you feel better?
buffy_summers What are you doing here?
xander_harris I thought you might need to talk. Then I saw the skirmish happen. I was gonna lend a hand, but I noticed you grew a few extra ones.
buffy_summers Go home, Xander.
xander_harris Buffy.
buffy_summers I'm serious!
xander_harris So am I. Something's up. You're acting like a crazy person.
xander_harris Take this, for instance. You don't wanna deal, so you hide? It's not very slayer-like.
buffy_summers Just leave me alone, Xander. You have no idea what's going on.
xander_harris No? Good, so you and Riley *aren't* imploding? It doesn't take a genius. What I can't figure out is how you never saw it coming.
buffy_summers What? Who told you?
xander_harris Nobody told me anything, Buffy. It was right in front of my Xander face. The guy would do anything for you.
buffy_summers The guy got himself bit by a vampire! He lied to me. He ran around behind my back and almost got himself killed! And now he tells me that he's leaving with some covert military operation at midnight unless *I* convince him not to. Now tell me that you understand. Because I sure as hell don't.
xander_harris You gonna let him go?
buffy_summers It's not my decision to make.
xander_harris Of course it is.
buffy_summers Well, it's not fair.
xander_harris Who cares if it's fair? In about twenty minutes, Riley's gonna disappear, maybe forever, unless you do something to stop him.
buffy_summers What am I supposed to do? Beg him to stay?
xander_harris Why wouldn't you? To keep Riley here-
buffy_summers I don't even know who he is any more. I mean, I thought he was ... dependable.
xander_harris Dependable? What is he, State Farm?
buffy_summers You know what I mean.
xander_harris Yeah. I think you mean convenient. I think you took it for granted that he was gonna show up when you wanted him to, and take off when you didn't.
buffy_summers Look who's talking. Look who has Anya following him around like a lovesick puppy.
xander_harris Oh boy, is this *not* about me.
buffy_summers Is she more than a convenience? 'Cause that would kinda be a surprise.
xander_harris If you don't wanna hear what I have to say, I'll shut up right now.
buffy_summers Good, 'cause I don't.
xander_harris I lied. See, what I think, you got burned with Angel, then Riley shows up.
buffy_summers I know the story, Xander.
xander_harris But you miss the point. You shut down, Buffy. And you've been treating Riley like the rebound guy. When he's the one that comes along once in a lifetime. He's never held back with you. He's risked everything. And you're about to let him fly because you don't like ultimatums?
xander_harris If he's not the guy, if what he needs from you just isn't there, let him go. Break his heart, and make it a clean break. But if you really think you can love this guy ... I'm talking scary, messy, no-emotions-barred need ... if you're ready for that ... then think about what you're about to lose.
buffy_summers Xander...
xander_harris Run.
buffy_summers Riley! Riley!
buffy_summers Riley! Riley!
xander_harris I've gotta say something...
xander_harris 'Cause ... I don't think I've made it clear.
xander_harris I'm in love with you.
xander_harris Powerfully, painfully in love. The things you do ... the way you think ... the way you move ... I get excited every time I'm about to see you.
xander_harris You make me feel like I've never felt before in my life. Like a man. I just thought you might wanna know.
