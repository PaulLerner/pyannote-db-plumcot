xander_harris I think I'm gonna be sick.
anya Again?
buffy_summers Xander, we don't have time.
xander_harris I know, it's just ... what happened back there, the sounds of it. The smell.
buffy_summers I know.
xander_harris Willow did that.
buffy_summers That's why we have to keep moving.
buffy_summers You heard what she said, One down.
anya So we're talking about two to go, right, Jonathan and whatshisface, the other guy.
buffy_summers Andrew. They're sitting at county jail without a clue Willow's coming.
xander_harris You don't think she's gonna kill them too? She wouldn't. It doesn't make sense.
buffy_summers Willow's got an addictive personality, and she just tasted blood. She could be there already.
anya No. She couldn't, a witch at her level. She can only go airborne. It's a thing. More flashy, impresses the locals, but it does take longer.
xander_harris Longer than what?
anya Teleporting.
xander_harris Right. Vengeance demon. Well, at least she'll get there first.
buffy_summers I'm counting the ways that could go wrong.
xander_harris Well, Anya can handle herself.
buffy_summers Against Willow? Tonight ? Don't be too sure.
xander_harris Well ... she should be coming down at some point, shouldn't she? I mean, back there she was out of her head ... running on grief and magicks.
buffy_summers Doesn't matter . Willow just killed someone. Killing people changes you. Believe me, I know.
xander_harris Warren was a cold-blooded killer of women just warming up. You ask me, that bastard had it coming to him.
buffy_summers Maybe. Andrew and Jonathan don't.
xander_harris This is still Willow we're dealing with, right?
buffy_summers I hope so. Whatever she's going through, we have to stop her. And maybe we can actually do that if we can get to your...
buffy_summers ...car.
xander_harris Willow.
buffy_summers I guess she wants to finish the job without us tagging along. Meet me at the jail.
xander_harris Sure, how are you gonna...
xander_harris Okay, then, I'll just ... catch up. She's only my best friend, you know. No big deal, just...
xander_harris ...glad I could help.
andrew_wells Dude. Move like, a foot to your left.
jonathan_levinson What for?
andrew_wells I'm trying to hear something.
jonathan_levinson Like what?
andrew_wells Signals.
jonathan_levinson Oh, for crying out loud. Signals? Who from, your probe-happy alien friends? Say, maybe we can trade a pack of cigarettes in for tin foil. Make you a nice antenna hat.
andrew_wells Laugh it up, fuzzball. I figured it out. Warren never abandoned us. Well, not me, anyway. This is like his test. If we can figure out how he's communicating with us, then we'll be, you know, worthy.
jonathan_levinson You're checking for implants?
andrew_wells Lex Luthor had a false epidermis escape kit in Superman Versus the Amazing Spider-Man Treasury edition-
jonathan_levinson Okay, first of all, those were sonic disrupters. And second of all ... you are sadness personified. Waiting for Warren? Yeah, maybe he'll come bust us out of here on Santa's magic sleigh.
andrew_wells I'm telling him you said that.
jonathan_levinson Why wait? I'll tell him right now.
jonathan_levinson Hey, Warren, do you read me, your girlfriend's pathetic, over.
andrew_wells Shut up, Jerk-athan! You see this? This is why we get jet packs and all you get is left behind.
jonathan_levinson So you admit it.
andrew_wells Why not? You were out of the Trio a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away and you know why, little feller? No respect for the chain of command.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, see how far it's gotten you. Checking every hole in your sad little body for transmitters that don't exist.
andrew_wells Oh I'll find it if I have to check every hole in my body and yours.
jonathan_levinson Get off!
andrew_wells Make me!
anya There you two are.
andrew_wells You do that?
anya Listen to me. We have to get you out of here or you'll both be killed. Guard!
jonathan_levinson What's going on?
anya Guard!
andrew_wells Stop that! I don't trust her. Do you trust her? This is major uncool.
jonathan_levinson Um, Anya, you're gonna have to break this down for us a little.
anya Warren shot Buffy. Warren shot Tara. Buffy's alive. Tara's dead. Willow found out, and being the most powerful Wicca in the western hemisphere, decided to get the payback. With interest.
andrew_wells Wh-what about Warren?
anya She killed him. Ripped him apart and bloodied up the forest doing it. Now she's coming here and the two of you are next.
andrew_wells Oh my god ... Warren.
jonathan_levinson Oh my god ... me. Guard!
andrew_wells But we didn't do anything.
jonathan_levinson Guard!!
officer All right, all right, what do you...
officer Who the hell are you?
anya Something's coming. Something bad. You have to let these men out of here or I guarantee you there will be hell to pay.
officer Okay, uh ... what exactly's coming?
anya One of the many things in this world you are not prepared to deal with.
officer That a fact?
anya Yes. And we're running out of time. So just believe me when I tell you...
anya ...these things are real. They're dangerous. And they're coming.
patrol_cop What the hell was that?
patrol_cop Listen, I don't know what you think you're doing, but just-
willow_rosenberg Take a nap.
anya ...so please, stop looking at me like it's your first trip to the circus and do your job. Let them out!
officer You three stay here.
andrew_wells Oh, like we have a choice!
officer Don't move. You'll be safe here.
anya Are you even listening?! This is the one place they won't be safe!
willow_rosenberg Back off.
COP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode21 Hold it!
andrew_wells Stop it, just stop! Why is she doing this? Tell her, we didn't do anything.
jonathan_levinson Yes we did. We signed on, we teamed up, we wanted to see where our plans would take us, well take a look.
jonathan_levinson This is it.
andrew_wells Maybe for you.
andrew_wells Anya. Teleport us out of here, please. Take us with you.
anya I can't. It doesn't work that way.
andrew_wells Oh, god. HELP!
willow_rosenberg Buffy.
anya Willow , just stop for a second and listen to-
Same_scene#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode21 Willow still screaming. Cut to the street. Buffy, Jonathan, and Andrew come out of the police station through the same door that Buffy entered earlier. Willow's scream is audible. Andrew has his hands over his ears.
andrew_wells Aah! What is that sound? God, it kills.
buffy_summers We have to make a run for it.
andrew_wells Are you kidding? She's like Dark Phoenix up there! You expect us just to outrun her?
buffy_summers Pretty much.
xander_harris Get in.
buffy_summers Is she coming?
xander_harris I don't see anything.
buffy_summers Are you guys all right?
buffy_summers Are you injured?
jonathan_levinson I, I don't think so.
andrew_wells Where are you taking us?
buffy_summers We'll find someplace safe and we'll keep you there until we can stop Willow.
andrew_wells Run and hide, that's your brilliant plan?
jonathan_levinson I don't believe this.
xander_harris Boys, if you don't knock it off, I will pull this car over and you can just walk to your painful deaths from here.
jonathan_levinson I don't get it. Willow's a witch. Why doesn't she just , you know, wave her arms and make us dead?
buffy_summers Because she doesn't want you dead. She wants to kill you.
andrew_wells But we didn't do anything.
andrew_wells Ow!
xander_harris Hate to admit it, Buff, but Jonathan may have a point. Why isn't she right here right now?
buffy_summers Maybe she's just getting her mojo up and running. Or maybe she hasn't figured out exactly how much power she really has yet. Neither have we.
xander_harris Guess we keep running, then.
jonathan_levinson I still can't believe that was Willow. I mean, I've known her almost as long as you guys. Willow was ... you know. She packed her own lunches and wore floods and was always... just Willow.
jonathan_levinson Geez it!
andrew_wells What was that?
xander_harris Just Willow.
xander_harris O-okay, any ideas?
buffy_summers Drive faster.
xander_harris This is faster!
jonathan_levinson She knows you're in this car too, right?
jonathan_levinson Right?!
jonathan_levinson She's draining.
xander_harris She's what-ing?
jonathan_levinson Just keep going.
andrew_wells Cool.
clem Not that I'm knocking the nacho cheese ones. I like the taste. It's just the texture I can't deal with.
clem So gritty. Kinda hurts my tongue. So, I'd give 'em a seven. Maybe a seven-five ... and, you think this is dumb, don't you?
dawn_summers Uh, no! No, as taste tests go, this is definitely one of the better ones I've been to.CLEM: I get it. No biggie. Uh, you wanna play cards?
dawn_summers Clem...
clem I can be a real boredom-buster, if you just give me half a chance.
dawn_summers It's not you.
clem Still, I feel responsible. It's not fair ... girl your age, cooped up in a crypt. Tell you what, let me get my hat and coat, I'll take you to a movie. We'll go nuts! PG-thirteen.
dawn_summers Clem!
clem Uh-huh?
dawn_summers Look at me. Do I look weak to you? O-or incapable?
clem Heck no.
dawn_summers So why am I stuck here?
clem No good reason I can see. I'm still real sorry about what happened. If there's anything I can do to help ... just name it.
dawn_summers Anything?
clem Ohh ... you're not going to get yourself in trouble now, are you? Or me? 'Cause your sister's the Slayer; I'm a demon, that's real good incentive to get along with her.
dawn_summers I need a demon to help me.
dawn_summers Spike would have.
clem Spike's gone.
cave_demon You understand, then.
spike Yeah. Yeah, it's not like you haven't been clear about it, oh great mysterious one. This is a test. I don't get what I want unless I pass said test. That about the size and shape?
cave_demon Yes.
spike And since your pad is decked out gladiator-style, and no number two pencils have been provided ... I guess we're not starting with the written.
spike Oh, here we go then. Just me and the walking action figure. I'm venturing this would be the kill-or-be-killed type of situation, then?
cave_demon To the death.
spike Right.
spike Here we are now. Entertain us.
spike Oh, son of a b...
dawn_summers Rack's place was right around here last time.
clem Oh, huh, I don't feel anything. Oh well. Not here. Let's go home.
dawn_summers You don't feel anything because his place moves. I told you.
clem Know why Rack moves all the time? Because he's shady. A bad element comes down here.
dawn_summers I get that. But Willow's part of it now. She is the element. If she isn't around somewhere, Rack may know where she is. Which is why we need to talk to him.
clem We? In a face to face way?
dawn_summers Or me. I'll go in there without you.
clem No, no, it's fine, I'm good, it's just, Rack isn't partial to the floppy-eared. He has a thing! But, but hey, I'm in. Absolutely.
dawn_summers Either way. Just get me there.
clem Say Rack does know where Willow is. He's not going to tell you for nothing. He's gonna want something.
dawn_summers I have money.
clem That's not the kind of something he's gonna want. Rack likes little girls.
dawn_summers I am not a little girl.
clem I, I don't know if you've thought this through. I'm supposed to keep you safe and this whole thing is... I mean, even if you find Willow ... you really think you can stop her?
xander_harris Thanks, Anya, for getting here so fast. It's a big help.
anya Once again, Xander in need of the big help.
xander_harris Whatever. So, can you still sense Willow? Knowing her location'd be a real big comfort right about now.
anya No, I can't. Which means whatever she's feeling, it's gone way beyond simple vengeance.
xander_harris Did I mention me needing the comfort?
buffy_summers Whatever we've got, better grab it fast. This is one of the first places she's gonna think to look for us.
andrew_wells Then what are we doing here? You know, I could summon a demon that would kill her.
xander_harris And I could smack you so hard your eyeballs would switch sockets.BUFFY: No one is getting killed. Sit down.
buffy_summers We need to find some sort of magicks that'll stop Willow. Or at least slow her down.XANDER: But she drained the place.
xander_harris Took everything.
anya Not everything.
xander_harris What is it?
anya Um, book of protection spells. Anti-magic, our last resort.
xander_harris Think you can work this stuff?
anya Ah. Okay. Well, the good news is, text is intact. Bad news is, ah, I can't read a word of it. It's like in, ancient Sumerian or something.
jonathan_levinson Could I take a look at it?
buffy_summers Shut up.
jonathan_levinson Right.
jonathan_levinson I just thought, you know, as long as you're protecting us, the least I could do is-
buffy_summers I'm not protecting you, Jonathan. None of us are. We're doing this for Willow. The only reason it happens to be your lucky day? Is because Willow kills you, she crosses a line, I lose a friend. And I hate losing.
jonathan_levinson I get that. It's just ... you know she's running out of power, right? I can tell. I can practically feel it. I've dabbled in the magicks.
xander_harris I think Willow's in a league of her own about now, dabble-boy.
jonathan_levinson But still, running that hot for that long, it's just a matter of time before you gotta re-charge, no matter how juiced up you are.
buffy_summers Thank you. Now you remember that thing we talked about?
jonathan_levinson About me shutting up?
jonathan_levinson Right.
xander_harris Buffy, let's say this works. And we stop Willow from working the hoodoo for a minute. What then?
buffy_summers I talk to her.
xander_harris Great. And say what?
buffy_summers Look ... whatever she's gonna do, she starts with those two. They're the line she cannot cross. And if she's running low on magicks ? Then she's probably somewhere right now trying to get it all back.
rack Hey, babe. I been waiting for you.
rack Guess the rehab didn't take, huh. That's the way it goes sometimes.
rack But I gotta say ... I could feel you coming a mile away, the power you got. And you know something, sweetness? I liked it.
rack When you first came to me, you were just a little ... slip of a girl.
rack Look at you now, all ... growed up. So full of dark juice.
rack And you still taste like strawberries. Only now ... ...you're ripe.
rack You came because you want something. Don't you?
rack I thought so. So tell me, Strawberry...
rack ...what on this earth do you want?
willow_rosenberg Just to take a little tour.
dawn_summers Yay, Clem, making with the demon senses! I knew you'd find this place.
clem It's not very clean.
dawn_summers Don't wig out on me again.
clem It's just, I'm still not so sure you should be here. I'm not so sure *I* should be here.
dawn_summers It'll only take a minute. Come on.
dawn_summers You wanna wait here?
clem If that works for you...
dawn_summers Be right back.
dawn_summers Willow?
willow_rosenberg Hey, cutie.
willow_rosenberg Dawnie, what are you doing here? 'Cause if you're looking for me? Now's not a great time.
dawn_summers You look terrible.
willow_rosenberg Do I?
dawn_summers You're back on the magicks.
willow_rosenberg No, honey. I am the magicks.
dawn_summers Did you kill that guy?
willow_rosenberg It's an improvement, believe me.
dawn_summers I have to go.
willow_rosenberg Why? So you can run and tell Buffy?
dawn_summers Willow ... please, just listen to me.
willow_rosenberg You don't have to talk. Just think real loud. I can hear you.
dawn_summers You're freaking me out.
willow_rosenberg Oh, don't be like that. I'm just a little wired. And I have some things to do. I thought if anybody'd understand-
dawn_summers I miss Tara, too!
dawn_summers But this? What you're doing here? This is not the way to go! You're only going to make things worse! But I promise, it's not too late to-
willow_rosenberg You miss her?
dawn_summers Yes.
willow_rosenberg Did you cry? Of course you did. I get that.
willow_rosenberg I understand the crying, you cry because you're human. But you weren't always.
dawn_summers Yes, I was.
willow_rosenberg No, please. You're telling me you don't remember? You used to be some ... mystic ball of energy. Maybe that's why you're crying all the time, Dawnie. 'Cause you don't belong here.
willow_rosenberg Wanna go back? End the pain? You'll be happier. I'll be happier. We'll all be a lot happier without listening to the constant whining.
dawn_summers Willow, stop...
willow_rosenberg Mom! Buffy! Tara! Waah! It's time you go back to being a little energy ball.
willow_rosenberg No more tears, Dawnie.
buffy_summers I think you need to get away from her.
anya You're too close.
xander_harris How am I supposed to read?
anya I don't know, I'm staring right at this stuff and I can't read it.
xander_harris Well, how's the translation coming? What have we got so far?
anya So far we've got the. Well, either the or towards, I'm not really sure. I can't do this. I'm in retail. Stupid ancient Sumerian.
jonathan_levinson I'm pretty sure it's Babylonian.
jonathan_levinson The text is similar, but the dialect is completely different.
xander_harris Great. Babylonian. Thanks a bushel. But unless you can read Babylonian, why don't you sit back down.
andrew_wells Why are you helping them?
jonathan_levinson Because they're saving our lives, you moron.
andrew_wells Uh-huh. And what then? Even if they kill that Wicca bitch, you think they're just gonna let us walk? They own us.
jonathan_levinson So what do you want me to do?
andrew_wells Look around. You know magic. We're in a magic shop. We can take them.
andrew_wells The books are sucked dry, but so what? There's still like tons of supplies all around us. This is the best chance we're gonna get to make it out of here.
jonathan_levinson And do what?
andrew_wells Start over. We can be a Duo. You and me. You can even be the leader, I swear, I'll take orders. I like taking orders. Just tell me what to do.
jonathan_levinson You want an order?
jonathan_levinson Grow up.
xander_harris Hey now, play nice, fellas, or you'll break our concentration.
anya Which means no protection spell.
xander_harris And Willow will make you two boneless chickens skinless, too.
andrew_wells And then what? You think your little witch buddy's gonna stop with us? You saw her! She's a truck-driving Magic Mama! And we've got maybe seconds before Darth Rosenberg grinds everybody into Jawa-burgers, and not one of you bunch has the midichlorians to stop her.
xander_harris You've never had any tiny bit of sex, have you?
anya The annoying virgin has a point. What if Willow fillets their soles and then comes after us?
xander_harris She won't.
anya You don't know that.
xander_harris We're her friends, Anya. Her family. She would never hurt us.
anya She tried to use you for a hood ornament, Xander. She doesn't care if you live or die.
xander_harris Guess you two finally have something in common
anya I care if you live or die, Xander. I'm just not sure which one I want.
xander_harris Again with the comfort. Look, we both know things might get ugly at, uh, Wiccapalooza. And if it gets really bad...
anya Let me guess. You'll propose?
xander_harris I need to know if you're gonna turn on me. Use this little shindig as an excuse for some sweet revenge.
anya There is nothing in this world that could give me greater or more lasting satisfaction than to reap bloody vengeance upon you, Xander Harris. But I can't. Not officially, not magically . So smile, it's your lucky day. You got away with it, I can't hurt you.
xander_harris Right, 'cause you varnishing the table with Spike, how could that possibly have hurt? It may have chafed...
anya That wasn't vengeance. It was solace.
anya Look ... I really can't hurt you, so, I'm just gonna have to settle for hating you.
xander_harris If that's what you need to do.
anya Don't! You don't get to play the martyr.
xander_harris I'm not.
anya You know, none of this would be happening if it weren't for you.
xander_harris You think I don't know that? You think I'm the hero of this piece? I saw the gun. Before Warren raised it, I ... I saw it, and I couldn't move. He shot two of my friends ... before I could even.... You want me to know how useless I am? That it's my fault? Thanks. Already got the memo.
anya I was talking about us.
buffy_summers You need to back down a minute and think, Will.
willow_rosenberg I wasn't gonna hurt her. Buzzkill.
dawn_summers She tried to turn me back...
buffy_summers You're attacking the people who love you now?
willow_rosenberg Only the ones in my way.
buffy_summers That's not ... You need help.
willow_rosenberg I'm doing fine on my own, thanks.
buffy_summers Dawn, get out of here. Go!
willow_rosenberg Don't. We're all friends.
buffy_summers Willow, I know what you want to do, but you have to listen to me. The forces inside you are incredibly powerful. They're strong ... but you're stronger. You have to remember you're still Willow.
willow_rosenberg Let me tell you something about Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow in junior high school, high school, up until college. With her stupid mousy ways. And now? Willow's a junkie.
buffy_summers I can help.
willow_rosenberg The only thing Willow was ever good for...
willow_rosenberg ...the only thing I had going for me ... were the moments - just moments - when Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. And that will never happen again.
buffy_summers I know this hurts. Bad. But Willow, if you let loose with the magicks, it will never end.
willow_rosenberg Promise?
buffy_summers You don't want that.
willow_rosenberg Why not?
buffy_summers Because you lose everything. Your friends, your self.... Willow, if you let this control you then the world goes away. And all of us with it. There's so much to live for. Will, there's too much-
willow_rosenberg Oh, please! This is your pitch? Buffy, you hate it here as much as I do. I'm just more honest about it.
buffy_summers That's not true.
willow_rosenberg You're trying to sell me on the world.
willow_rosenberg The one where you lie to your friends when you're not trying to kill them? And you screw a vampire just to feel? And insane asylums are the comfy alternative? This world? Buffy, it's me. I know you were happier when you were in the ground. The only time you were ever at peace in your whole life is when you were dead. Until Willow brought you back.
willow_rosenberg You know, with magic?
willow_rosenberg Oh. Sorry, the trip can be kind of rough...
willow_rosenberg ...if you're, you know , not me.
buffy_summers Dawn!
willow_rosenberg Jonathan. Andrew. You boys like magic, don't you?
willow_rosenberg Abracadabra.
willow_rosenberg Okay. Didn't see that coming.
andrew_wells W-what was that?
jonathan_levinson We're alive.
willow_rosenberg You guys want to take it slow? I can do that, too. Ask Warren.
buffy_summers Don't!
jonathan_levinson Let's get out of here.
willow_rosenberg No no, stay.
willow_rosenberg I mean, we're just getting started.
willow_rosenberg I've got big party plans.
buffy_summers Will-
xander_harris No, don't.
willow_rosenberg Guys, come on. I'm just getting wood for the violence here. And you know what they say ... if at first you don't succeed...
spike Had enough?
spike Bad move, bad move, bad move...
spike Looks like local boy loses.
cave_demon So it would appear.
spike Good on me, then. I get what I came for. I passed, right?
cave_demon Indeed. You have passed the first stage of the test.
spike Right, I get... Wait. First stage?
spike Bugger.
willow_rosenberg Damn, that is one effective counter-spell.
willow_rosenberg Won't keep you alive, though.
buffy_summers Will, stop. You need to give this up now.
willow_rosenberg I get it. You boys put a, a spell on yourselves, didn't you. Protecting you from harm ... from magicks. That's cute.
buffy_summers Will, back off before somebody gets hurt.
willow_rosenberg How 'bout I back off right after? So, which one of you boys worked the mojo?
willow_rosenberg Doesn't matter, really. I'm just curious.
willow_rosenberg Just because I can't do magicks to you, doesn't mean I can't do them on myself.
willow_rosenberg Now I'm pretty sure I'm strong enough to beat you to death.
buffy_summers I don't want to hurt you.
willow_rosenberg Not a problem.
buffy_summers I said I didn't *want* to.
buffy_summers Didn't say I wouldn't.
xander_harris Let's go.
jonathan_levinson What about Willow?
xander_harris Buffy can handle her.
dawn_summers Are you sure?
xander_harris No, that's why we're leaving.
xander_harris Come on!
anya I can't, I, I have to stay here to keep the spell going on Willow.
xander_harris No, but...
anya Go, do something right!
willow_rosenberg No!
willow_rosenberg So. Here we are.
buffy_summers Are we really gonna do this?
willow_rosenberg Come on, this is a huge deal for me! Six years as a side man, and now I get to be the Slayer.
buffy_summers A killer isn't a Slayer. Being a Slayer means something you can't conceive of.
willow_rosenberg Oh, Buffy. You really need to have every square inch of your ass kicked.
buffy_summers Then show me what you got. And I'll show you what a Slayer really is.
andrew_wells Where are you taking us?
dawn_summers Someplace safe.
jonathan_levinson Like where?
dawn_summers Xander?
xander_harris I don't know.
willow_rosenberg Get off, super-bitch.
buffy_summers I can help you stop.
willow_rosenberg I thought you were gonna show me what a Slayer was.
jonathan_levinson Can't ... run any more. I need to ... breathe.
xander_harris If you wanna keep breathing, you gotta keep moving.
andrew_wells This is bogus. We gotta get out of this town. Mexico. We should go to Mexico.
xander_harris Hey. You're not going anywhere. We just gotta find a place to hide you two until we get the all-clear from Buffy.
andrew_wells Yeah, and what if the Slayer's dead already? We're just supposed to sit around waiting for Sabrina to show up and disembowel us?
xander_harris You do what I say to-
andrew_wells I don't think so.
willow_rosenberg Well, hey. Isn't that interesting. Anya's still here.
willow_rosenberg Looks like I've been beating on the wrong gal.
xander_harris Whoa, whoa. Okay, Andy. Let's just put the sword down.
andrew_wells Oh, no way. I'm not gonna die because of something I didn't even do.
xander_harris You're not gonna die.
dawn_summers Leave him alone.
jonathan_levinson Let him go, Andrew. You heard me.
andrew_wells You let me go first.
jonathan_levinson Uh-uh. Him.
andrew_wells It's your move.
jonathan_levinson No. Yours.
andrew_wells I'm not moving. I'm not gonna budge 'til...
andrew_wells ...right now. Ow!
jonathan_levinson Xander's right. We're not leaving Sunnydale. When this is over, you and I are going back to jail to do our time.
anya Help me!
anya Help me! You're hurting me.
willow_rosenberg You can't block my spells if you can't chant. And you can't chant if you're sleepin'.
