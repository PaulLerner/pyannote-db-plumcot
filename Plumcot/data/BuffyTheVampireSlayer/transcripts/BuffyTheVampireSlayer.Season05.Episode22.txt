rupert_giles You are the Slayer. Into each generation a Slayer is born.
buffy_summers Why don't we start with 'Hi, I'm Buffy.'
xander_harris Xander.
cordelia_chase Cordelia.
buffy_summers Willow, right?
rupert_giles Mister Giles.
angel Angel.
vampire Gave me a pretty good run there. Bet the blood's just pumpin'.
vampire Bet it's hot.
KID#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Don't hurt me.
vampire Don't hurt you?
buffy_summers Hey, what's going on?
KID#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Help me! Call the police!
vampire Get outta here, girl.
buffy_summers You guys havin' a fight? 'Cause, you know, fighting's not cool.
KID#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Get out of here!
vampire No. No, she wants to stay. I don't mind a little appetizer.
buffy_summers Have you ever heard the expression, 'biting off more than you can chew'?
buffy_summers Okay. Um ... how about the expression, 'vampire slayer'?
vampire What the hell you talkin' about?
buffy_summers Wow. Never heard that one. Okay. How about, 'Oh god, my leg, my leg'?
vampire Oh god! My leg! Uhh...
buffy_summers See? Now we're communicating.
buffy_summers Wow. Been a long while since I met one who didn't know me.
buffy_summers You should get home.
KID#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 H-how'd you do that?
buffy_summers It's what I do.
KID#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 But you're ... you're just a girl.
buffy_summers That's what *I* keep saying.
xander_harris Something goin' on out back?
buffy_summers Vampire.
xander_harris Oh.
buffy_summers Anything?
rupert_giles Nothing you want to hear. The ritual is, uh...
buffy_summers Explain it again.
rupert_giles There's nothing new to-
buffy_summers Go through it again.
rupert_giles The key was ... living energy. It needed to be channeled, poured into a specific place at a specific time. The energy ... would flow into that spot, the walls between the dimensions break down. It stops, the energy's used up, the walls come back up. Glory uses that time to get back into her own dimension, not caring that all manner of hell will be unleashed on earth in the meantime.
anya Um, but only for a little while, right? The walls come back up, uh, n-no more hell?
willow_rosenberg That's only if the energy is stopped. And now the key is human ... ...is Dawn.
rupert_giles The blood flows, the gates will open. The gates will close when it flows no more. When Dawn is dead.
tara_maclay I have places to be!
xander_harris Why blood? Why Dawn's blood? I mean, why couldn't it be like a, a lymph ritual?
spike 'Cause it's always got to be blood.
xander_harris We're not actually discussing dinner right now.
spike Blood is life, lackbrain. Why do you think we eat it? It's what keeps you going. Makes you warm. Makes you hard. Makes you other than dead. Course it's her blood.
buffy_summers Pretty simple math here. We stop Glory before she can start the ritual. We still have a couple of hours, right?
rupert_giles If my calculations are right. But Buffy-
buffy_summers I don't wanna hear it.
rupert_giles I understand that-
buffy_summers No! No, you don't understand. We are not talking about this.
rupert_giles Yes, we bloody well are!
rupert_giles If Glory begins the ritual ... if we can't stop her...
buffy_summers Come on. Say it. We're bloody well talking about this. Tell me to kill my sister.
rupert_giles She's not your sister.
buffy_summers No. She's not. She's more than that. She's me. The monks made her out of me. I hold her ... and I feel closer to her than ... It's not just the memories they built. It's physical. Dawn ... is a part of me. The only part that I-
willow_rosenberg We'll solve this. We will. Don't have another coma, okay?
rupert_giles If the ritual starts, then every living creature in this and every other dimension imaginable will suffer unbearable torment and death ... including Dawn.
buffy_summers Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.
rupert_giles You'll fail. You'll die. We all will.
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
buffy_summers I love you all ... but I'm sorry.
anya Okay. All in favor of stopping Glory *before* the ritual. Suggestions, ideas? Time's a-wastin'.
spike Uh ... when you say you love us all...
XANDER/GILES#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Shut up.
anya Willow. I bet you've got some dark spell a-brewin'. Uh, make her a, a, a toad? Little hoppy toad, we can hit her with a hammer?
tara_maclay Hoppy toad.
xander_harris What about Ben? He can be killed, right? I mean, I know he's an innocent, but, you know, not like Dawn innocent. We could kill a ... regular guy.
xander_harris God.
rupert_giles It's doubtful he'll surface again this close to the ritual. We can expect it's Glory we're dealing with.
willow_rosenberg We don't have to kill her. Uh, we just have to stop her from doing the ritual. I mean, there's only the one time that she can do it, right?
spike Yeah. We get her on the ropes, we just gotta keep her occupied till it's too late.
anya Okay. But I'm still not hearing enough ideas. She's a god. Let's think outside the box.
spike Why don't *you* go think outside the bleeding box.
rupert_giles Yes, Anya, apart from your incredibly uninfectious enthusiasm, have you anything else to contribu-
anya The Dagon sphere!
rupert_giles Sorry?
anya When Buffy first met Glory, she found that magical ... glowy sphere that was meant to repel Glory. We've got it in the basement. It might drive her away or hurt her. Ooh!
anya And Olaf the troll god's enchanted hammer.
anya You wanna fight a god, use the weapon of a god.
spike Uh, nah, that thing's too heavy to- Yeah. Good.
buffy_summers I like this. Thanks.
anya Here to help. Wanna live.
xander_harris Smart chicks are soooo hot.
willow_rosenberg You couldn't have figured that out in tenth grade?
rupert_giles Well, we have some ideas, if we could actually get Glory on the run, but, um...
buffy_summers But, we still have no idea how to find her.
tara_maclay Big day. Oh, it calls me! I have to be there!
tara_maclay Big day!
ben They, uh ... said you have to put this on ... for the ceremony.
dawn_summers What if I don't?
ben Come on, just-
dawn_summers What if I don't like the color?
ben Look, I ... I wish there was another way.
dawn_summers And I wish you'd fall on your head and drown in your own barf, so ... I guess we're both disappointed.
ben I think ... it'll be quick.
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Actually, sir, the bleeding is quite a slow process to give the portal time to-
ben Thank you ... for the information. I'll do what I can to-
dawn_summers Change.
ben What?
dawn_summers Change. Be her. I don't wanna look at you.
ben Dawn, I don't think you wanna-
dawn_summers Be Glory. Be Glory. Glory! Glory! Glory!
ben Will you just stop-
glory -shouting already?
glory Huh.
glory So, what's the hubbub, bub? What do you got against old Benjy?
dawn_summers He's a monster. At least you're up-front about it.
glory Don't be so hard on the boy. He just wants to live. Most guys would do the same. Besides, he's probably the reason your sis and her little cartoon pals are still alive. That little nagging pinch of humanity that makes me go for the hurt instead of the kill. Lowering myself to trade blows with the Slayer when I should have just put my fist through her heart.
glory It's gotta be Ben.
dawn_summers Or maybe you just can't take her.
glory Hmm, funny thing. You've been here for a few hours now, and I haven't seen big sis galloping in to save you. She probably knows what a terrible mistake that'd be.
dawn_summers She's not afraid of you.
glory Oh no, sweetie baby. I'm talking about the ritual. 'Cause you know I bleed you, the portals open, but once you die they close. The faster you die, the better for your sorry species.
glory I'm bettin' Buffy knows that. Since she's not really your sister, I'm guessin' she isn't gonna show. And if she does...
glory ...it might not be to save you.
dawn_summers Buffy.
rupert_giles You sure you're not going to tire yourself out?
buffy_summers I'm sure.
rupert_giles We're ... still working on ideas. Time's short, but, uh, best leave it to the last moment. If we go in too early and she takes us out, no chance of getting her to miss her window.
buffy_summers Then we wait.
rupert_giles I imagine you hate me right now.
rupert_giles I love Dawn.
buffy_summers I know.
rupert_giles But I've sworn to protect this sorry world, and sometimes that means saying and doing ... what other people can't. What they shouldn't have to.
buffy_summers You try and hurt her, and you know I'll stop you.
rupert_giles I know.
buffy_summers This is how many apocalypses for us now?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, well... six, at least. Feels like a hundred.
buffy_summers I've always stopped them. Always won.
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers I sacrificed Angel to save the world.
buffy_summers I loved him so much. But I knew ... what was right. I don't have that any more. I don't understand. I don't know how to live in this world if these are the choices. If everything just gets stripped away. I don't see the point. I just wish that... I just wish my mom was here.
buffy_summers The spirit guide told me ... that death is my gift. Guess that means a Slayer really is just a killer after all.
rupert_giles I think you're wrong about that.
buffy_summers It doesn't matter. If Dawn dies, I'm done with it. I'm quitting.
glory Okay, campers, it's almost stab time. You two, get her.
dawn_summers No. No! Aah! Buffy!
glory See you in a few.
rupert_giles Any luck? Have you found the Dagon sphere?
anya Um, I'm sure it's here, just be a minute!
xander_harris Yeah, we're on it! Let's look over here, where we didn't look yet.
rupert_giles Time is a factor.
anya Yes. Yes. Not to worry.
xander_harris So, are you more, uh ... relaxed?
anya No.
xander_harris No? I mean, it sounded like you, uh ... arrived.
anya No. Yes. Um, I had the pleasure moment, and the blissful calm that comes right after it. But that only lasted a couple of seconds, and now I'm terrified again.
xander_harris Well, you don't have to be.
xander_harris Gah!
anya What?
xander_harris Spike's sex-bot. Why didn't they just melt it down into scrap?
anya Maybe Willow wanted it.
xander_harris I don't think Willow feels that way about, about Buffy. I mean, I know she's gone through a lot of changes, but-
anya To study it.
xander_harris Right. Robotics. Science.
anya Pervert.
xander_harris Other pervert.
anya And don't frighten me like tha-aah!
anya God, who, who would put something like that there? Is this supposed to be some sort of sick joke?
anya I mean, things aren't bad enough! This is an omen.
xander_harris Hey, hey, shh.
anya No, no, it's an omen. It's a higher power, trying to tell me through bunnies that we're all gonna die. Oh god.
xander_harris No it's not.
xander_harris It's okay.
anya No, you see, usually when there's an apocalypse, I skedaddle. But now I love you so much that instead I have inappropriately timed sex and try to think of ways to fight a god ... and worry terribly that something might happen to you. And also worry that something'll happen to me. And then I have guilt that I'm not more worried about everyone else, but I just don't have enough! I'm just on total overload, and I honestly don't think that I could be more nervous than I am right now.
xander_harris Care to wager on that?
xander_harris Anya ... you wanna marry me?
xander_harris Can I take that as a maybe?
anya You're proposing to me!
xander_harris Yes...
anya You're proposing to me 'cause we're gonna die! And you think it's romantic and sexy and, and you know you're not gonna have to go through with it 'cause the world's gonna end!
xander_harris I'm proposing to you, Anya, because it's not.
anya You can't know that.
xander_harris I believe it. I think we're gonna get through this. I think I'm gonna live a long ... and silly life, and I'm not interested in doing that without you around.
anya Oh. Okay.
xander_harris Okay?
anya Yes. I mean, yes.
anya No.
xander_harris No?
anya After. Give it to me when the world doesn't end.
buffy_summers Will, what do you got for me?
willow_rosenberg Some ideas. Well, notions. Or, theories based on wild speculation. Did I mention I'm not good under pressure?
buffy_summers I need you, Will. You're my big gun.
willow_rosenberg I'm your - no, I-I was never a gun. Someone else should be the gun. I, I could be a, a cudgel. Or, or a pointy stick.
buffy_summers You're the strongest person here. You know that, right?
willow_rosenberg Well ... no.
buffy_summers Will, you're the only person that's ever hurt Glory. At all. You're my best shot at getting her on the ropes, so don't get a jelly belly on me now.
willow_rosenberg Well ... I, I ... do sort of have this one idea. But, last few days, I've mostly been looking into ways to help Tara. I-I know that shouldn't be my priority....
buffy_summers Of course it should.
willow_rosenberg Well, I've been charting their essences. Mapping out. I think ... if I can get close enough, I may be able to reverse what Glory did. Like, take back what she took from Tara. It might weaken Glory, or ... make her less coherent. Or it might make all our heads explode.
rupert_giles Buffy.
willow_rosenberg I'll try to work it.
willow_rosenberg Don't worry, love. It won't be long.
tara_maclay Bitch! I'm supposed to work on the factors!
tara_maclay I'm, I'm not ... I'm not....
willow_rosenberg I'm gonna bring you back.
buffy_summers No. No, no, that's good. That could be pivotal. Thank you guys.
rupert_giles Well, um, you're gonna need some-
buffy_summers Way ahead of you. We have time?
rupert_giles Yes, if you hurry.
buffy_summers Okay. I'll grab some weapons too.
xander_harris I'm looking for something in a broadsword.
spike Don't be swingin' that thing near me.
xander_harris Hey, I happen to be-
spike A glorified bricklayer?
xander_harris I'm also a swell bowler.
anya Has his own shoes.
spike The gods themselves do tremble.
buffy_summers Spike, shut your mouth, come with me.
buffy_summers The weapons are in the chest by the TV, I'll grab the stuff upstairs.
spike Uh, Buffy...
spike If you wanna just hand them over the threshold, I'll...
buffy_summers Come in, Spike.
spike Hmm. Presto. No barrier.
spike Um, won't bother with the small stuff. Couple of good axes should hold off Glory's mates while you take on the lady herself.
buffy_summers We're not all gonna make it. You know that.
spike Yeah.
spike Hey. Always knew I'd go down fightin'.
buffy_summers I'm counting on you ... to protect her.
spike Till the end of the world. Even if that happens to be tonight.
buffy_summers I'll be a minute.
spike Yeah.
spike I know you'll never love me.
spike I know that I'm a monster. But you treat me like a man. And that's...
spike Get your stuff, I'll be here.
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 She will come to you soon.
buffy_summers We on schedule?
rupert_giles Yes, it's time.
buffy_summers Will?
willow_rosenberg Tara, baby? Is there somewhere you should be?
tara_maclay They held me down.
willow_rosenberg No one's holding you. It's the big day, right?
willow_rosenberg Do you wanna go?
tara_maclay You're a killer. This is all set down.
buffy_summers Stay close but don't crowd her. We'll follow in a minute.
buffy_summers Everybody knows their jobs. Remember, the ritual starts, we all die. And I'll kill anyone who comes near Dawn.
spike Well, not exactly the St. Crispin's Day speech, was it?
rupert_giles We few...
rupert_giles ...we happy few.
spike We band of buggered.
xander_harris Shpadoinkle.
anya What is that?
rupert_giles The portal must open up there.
buffy_summers Will, you're up.
rupert_giles Need anything?
willow_rosenberg Could use a little courage.
willow_rosenberg The real kind.
willow_rosenberg But thanks.
glory You. What are you doing here?
willow_rosenberg She's with me.
glory What the frickin' hell did that bitch do to me?
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 You look fine. Truly.
glory She made a little ... she made a hole. Uh, I need a brain to eat.
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Oh, take mine, oh groove-tastic one!
glory I said a brain, you worthless dirt!
glory Big day. I got places to be, big day. Need a brain.
glory Suppose I could always use yours.
buffy_summers Okay then.
buffy_summers Come and get it.
buffy_summers You don't seem very well.
glory Your little witch bitch ... gave me kind of a headache there. But if you think this is gonna last more than eight seconds-
buffy_summers I noticed you're talking, whereas in your position, I would attack me.
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Oh, most sweaty-naughty-feelings-causing one, should we...
glory Go guard the girl. This is a ... this is a, a...
MINION#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Diversionary tactic?
glory Go guard!
buffy_summers It's strange, you're not as blurry with speed as usual either.
glory The witch...
buffy_summers It's not her.
buffy_summers Might be this.
buffy_summers I heard it's supposed to repel you. So my guess is ... you probably shouldn't touch it, either.
glory You're gonna wish you-
MINION_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Stand fast! Kill anyone who dares approach! This will be our day of glory!
MINION_2#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Well punned.
MINION_1#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Well, it just called out to me.
willow_rosenberg Tara!
willow_rosenberg Tara?
willow_rosenberg Tara?
tara_maclay W ... Willow?
willow_rosenberg Tara?
tara_maclay Willow ... I got so lost.
willow_rosenberg I found you.
willow_rosenberg I will always find you.
glory You know what?
glory I'm feeling a little better. And now? I'm a little bored.
buffy_summers Oh, I'm sorry. Cause you're about-
glory Hey, wow, the Slayer's a robot. Did everybody else know the Slayer was a robot?
buffy_summers Glory?
buffy_summers You're not the brightest god in the heavens, are you?
dawn_summers Buffy! I'm up here!
dawn_summers Buffy!
glory Oh no you don't!
dawn_summers Buffy! I'm up here!
dawn_summers Buffy!
glory You lost your hammer, sweet cheeks. What are you gonna hit me with now?
buffy_summers Whatever's handy.
xander_harris The glorified bricklayer picks up a spare.
anya Has anyone noticed we're going backwards?
spike It's crossed my mind.
rupert_giles As long as ... Buffy can keep Glory down ... long enough, it doesn't matter. There's only a few minutes left to start the ritual.
dawn_summers You. You can help me. Untie me. Please. Help me, she's coming.
doc Well, it seems she's running a bit late, is the thing. And, uh, if her Splendidness can't be here in time to bleed you...
doc Hey! Kid. Wanna see a trick?
xander_harris How we doing?
anya So far it's a tie.
rupert_giles We haven't got up to Dawn, but then neither has anyone else.
spike Someone's up there.
xander_harris Okay, we gotta charge or something.
anya We tried that.
willow_rosenberg Spike. Can you hear me?
spike Yeah, loud and clear.
willow_rosenberg Is there someone up there with Dawn?
spike Yeah, can't tell who.
xander_harris Are you talking to us?
willow_rosenberg Get up there. Go now.
spike Yeah, but-
willow_rosenberg Go!
doc Well. What do you know? It's just about that time.
dawn_summers Spike!
spike Doesn't a fella stay dead when you kill him?
doc Look who's talking.
spike Come on, Doc. Let's you and me have a go.
doc I ... do have a prior appointment.
spike This won't take long.
doc No, I-I don't imagine it will.
glory You're just a mortal. You couldn't understand my pain.
buffy_summers Then I'll just have to settle for causing it.
glory You can't kill me.
buffy_summers No ... but my arm's not even tired yet.
spike You don't come near the girl, Doc.
doc I don't smell a soul anywhere on you. Why do you even care?
spike I made a promise to a lady.
doc Oh?
doc Then I'll send the lady your regrets.
spike No.
dawn_summers Aah! No!
glory Stop it.
buffy_summers You're a god.
buffy_summers Make it stop.
ben I'm sorry.
buffy_summers Tell her it's over. She missed her shot. She goes. She ever, *ever* comes near me and mine again...
ben We won't. I swear.
ben I guess we're stuck with each other, huh baby?
rupert_giles Can you move?
ben Need a ... a minute. She could've killed me.
rupert_giles No she couldn't. Never. And sooner or later Glory will re-emerge, and ... make Buffy pay for that mercy. And the world with her. Buffy even knows that... and still she couldn't take a human life.
rupert_giles She's a hero, you see. She's not like us.
ben Us?
doc Shallow cuts... shallow cuts...
doc Let the blood ... flow ...
doc ...free.
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers Buffy!
doc This should be interesting.
buffy_summers Here.
dawn_summers Buffy, it hurts.
buffy_summers I got it. Come here. You're gonna be okay.
buffy_summers Go!
dawn_summers Buffy, it's started.
anya Xander!
xander_harris Anya!
dawn_summers I'm sorry.
buffy_summers It doesn't matter.
buffy_summers What are you doing?
dawn_summers I have to jump. The energy.
buffy_summers It'll kill you.
dawn_summers I know. Buffy, I know about the ritual. I have to stop it.
buffy_summers No.
dawn_summers I have to. Look at what's happening.
dawn_summers Buffy, you have to let me go. Blood starts it, and until the blood stops flowing, it'll never stop.
dawn_summers You know you have to let me. It has to have the blood.
spike Cause it's always got to be blood.
buffy_summers It's Summers blood. It's just like mine.
buffy_summers She's me. The monks made her out of me.
FIRST_SLAYER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 Death is your gift.
buffy_summers Death...
FIRST_SLAYER_VOICEOVER#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode22 ...is your gift.
dawn_summers Buffy ... no!
buffy_summers Dawnie, I have to.
dawn_summers No!
buffy_summers Listen to me. Please, there's not a lot of time, listen.
buffy_summers Dawn, listen to me. Listen.
buffy_summers I love you. I will *always* love you.
buffy_summers But this is the work that I have to do.
buffy_summers Tell Giles ... tell Giles I figured it out. And, and I'm okay.
buffy_summers And give my love to my friends.
buffy_summers You have to take care of them now.
buffy_summers You have to take care of each other.
buffy_summers You have to be strong.
buffy_summers Dawn, the hardest thing in this world ... is to live in it.
buffy_summers Be brave. Live.
buffy_summers For me.
