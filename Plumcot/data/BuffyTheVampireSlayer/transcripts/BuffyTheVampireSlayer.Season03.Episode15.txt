News_Anchor#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode15 We go now live to our field reporter, who is standing by at the waterfront with this breaking news about the murder that has shocked the Mayor and residents of Sunnydale.
Field_Reporter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode15 Fishermen discovered the body today, the victim of a brutal stabbing. Authorities and citizens alike were shocked when the slain man was identified as Deputy Mayor Allan Finch.
Field_Reporter#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode15 Still reeling from the news, Mayor Wilkins had this to say.
mayor_richard_wilkins Mr. Finch was not only my longtime aide and associate, he was a close personal friend. I promise you I will not rest until whoever did this is found and brought to justice. Thank you very much.
joyce_summers Oh, honey, you're up. Oh, it's just terrible, isn't it?
wesley_wyndampryce I want you to look into this. Find out everything you can about the murder of the Deputy Mayor.
buffy_summers But that's... I-I mean, that's... That's not really our jurisdiction, is it?
faith It's no big, B. We'll get into it if he wants.
rupert_giles No, Buffy's right. The Deputy Mayor's murder was the result of human malice. There's nothing supernatural about it.
wesley_wyndampryce We don't know that for certain. I say it merits investigation.
rupert_giles Which I'm sure the police are doing. Meantime, if you ask me, there are better uses for the Slayers' time.
wesley_wyndampryce Ah. But I don't believe I did. Ask you.
rupert_giles Considering the success of your previous adventure...
cordelia_chase Don't let me interrupt. Wait. Let me interrupt. I'm in a hurry.
rupert_giles What did you need?
cordelia_chase Uh, psych class. Freud and Jung. Book me?
rupert_giles Happily.
cordelia_chase Check out Giles: The Next Generation. What's your deal?
wesley_wyndampryce Uh, I, uh... Well... I'm a...
faith New Watcher.
cordelia_chase Oh.
wesley_wyndampryce Does everybody know about you?
buffy_summers She's a friend.
cordelia_chase Let's not exaggerate. So... You're the new Watcher.
wesley_wyndampryce Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
cordelia_chase I like a man with two last names. I'm Cordelia.
wesley_wyndampryce And you teach psychology.
cordelia_chase I *take* psychology.
rupert_giles She's a student.
wesley_wyndampryce Oh, well. I, uh... Yes. In fact, I am... here to watch... girls. Uh, uh, Buffy and Faith, to be specific.
cordelia_chase Well, it's about time we got some fresh blood around here.
wesley_wyndampryce Well. Fresh. Yes.
rupert_giles Here we go.
cordelia_chase Thanks. So, welcome to Sunnydale.
wesley_wyndampryce My. She is cheeky, isn't she?
faith Uh, first word: jail; second word: bait.
wesley_wyndampryce Ahem. Well, uh... Where were we?
buffy_summers Done. I mean, we were done, right?
faith Uh, yep. Off to patrol. So we'll see ya.
wesley_wyndampryce One moment, girls. I'm your commander now, and on the matter of this murder, I am resolved. Natural or super, I want to know.
faith Fine by me. Always ready to kick a little bad guy butt.
faith So, you gonna rat me out? Is that it?
buffy_summers Faith, we have to tell. I can't pretend to investigate this. I can't pretend that I don't know.
faith Oh, I see. But you can pretend that Angel's still dead when you need to protect him.
buffy_summers I *am* trying to protect you. Look, if-if we don't do the right thing, it's only gonna make things worse for you.
faith Worse than jail for the rest of my young life? No way!
buffy_summers Faith, what we did was...
faith Yeah. We. You were right there beside me when this whole thing went down. Anything I have to answer for, you do, too. You're a part of this, B. All the way.
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey. Where's Faith? I-I saw her around. Figured you two were gonna go kill some more nasty stuff.
buffy_summers Not right now. I-I, um, I think she bailed.
buffy_summers Willow, I was won...
willow_rosenberg Actually, I'm...
buffy_summers Um... You go ahead.
willow_rosenberg I'm late. I-I'm meeting Michael. The warlock guy? We're still trying to de-rat Amy.
buffy_summers Okay.
willow_rosenberg So see ya.
buffy_summers See you.
detective_stein So, uh... You heard the man scream about what time last night?
woman Oh, I'm not sure. 7:00, maybe 8:00.
detective_stein Can you be more specific, say between 7:30 and 8:00?
angel Your hand.
buffy_summers Oh. It's okay.
mayor_richard_wilkins It's not working.
mr_trick It's supposed to do something besides shred?
mayor_richard_wilkins It's *supposed* to cheer me *up*. Usually using the shredder gives me a lift. It's fun.
mr_trick And today you're not getting the ya-yas.
mayor_richard_wilkins No.
mayor_richard_wilkins Guess it'll take more than this to turn my frown upside down. I just *don't* understand why Allan would leave such a paper trail about our dealings. Do you think he was gonna betray me? Oh, now, that's a horrible thought. And now he's dead, I'll never have the chance to scold him.
mr_trick Maybe this will change your mood.
mayor_richard_wilkins What is it?
mr_trick Bombshell. The Deputy Mayor had wooden splinters in his wound. Struck right through the heart with a sharp, pointed object. Now, word is, someone was fighting vampires not a block away from the scene. Any smart money says it was a Slayer who did this job.
mayor_richard_wilkins Why? Do you think he talked? To them?
mr_trick If he did, I'm thinking he said the wrong thing.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, this *is* exciting. A Slayer up for Murder One. That's sunshine and roses to me. It really is.
faith I'm telling you, we did the world a favor. This guy was about as interesting as watching paint dry.
buffy_summers Faith...
faith I'm joking. Jeez, lighten up a little, B.
faith He came out of nowhere.
buffy_summers I know.
faith Whatever. I'm not lookin' to hug and cry and learn and grow. I'm just saying it happened quick, you know?
faith You know what? Let's just blow. Who cares what this guy was about? It's kind of moot now, don't you think?
buffy_summers I don't think he was in that alley by chance. I think he was looking for us. I'd like to know why.
faith So, what, you think there's some big conspiracy?
buffy_summers You were saying?
faith So his papers are gone. That doesn't prove anything.
buffy_summers Except that somebody didn't want us to prove anything.
mayor_richard_wilkins Get as many men on it as you can.
mr_trick Yeah. We'll be wanting to turn up the heat.
faith So the Mayor of Sunnydale is a Black Hat. That's a shocker, huh?
buffy_summers Actually, yeah. I didn't get the bad guy vibe off of him.
faith When are you gonna learn, B? It doesn't matter what kind of vibe you get off a person. 'Cause nine times out of ten, the face they're showing you is not the real one.
buffy_summers I guess you know a lot about that.
faith What is that supposed to mean?
buffy_summers It's just, look at you, Faith. Less than twenty-four hours ago, you killed a man. A-and now it's all zip-a-dee-doo-dah? It's not *your* real face, and I know it. Look, I know what you're feeling because I'm feeling it, too.
faith Do you? So fill me in 'cause I'd like to hear this.
buffy_summers Dirty. Like something sick creeped inside you and you can't get it out. And you keep hoping that it was just some nightmare, but it wasn't. And we are gonna have to figure out...
faith Is there gonna be an intermission in this?
buffy_summers Just let me talk to Giles, okay? I swear...
faith No! We're not bringing *anybody* else into this. You gotta keep your head, B. This is all gonna blow over in a few days.
buffy_summers And if it doesn't?
faith If it doesn't, they got a freighter leaving the docks at least twice a day. It ain't fancy, but it gets you gone.
buffy_summers And that's it? You just live with it? You see the dead guy in your head every day for the rest of your life?
faith Buffy, I'm not gonna *see* anything. I missed the mark last night and I'm sorry about the guy. I really am! But it happens! Anyway, how many people do you think we've saved by now, thousands? And didn't you stop the world from ending? Because in my book, that puts you and me in the plus column.
buffy_summers We help people! It doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.
faith Why not? The guy I offed was no Gandhi. I mean, we just saw he was mixed up in dirty dealings.
buffy_summers Maybe, but what if he was coming to us for help?
faith What if he was? You're still not seeing the big picture, B. Something made us different. We're warriors. We're built to kill.
buffy_summers To kill demons! But it does *not* mean that we get to pass judgment on people like we're better than everybody else!
faith We *are* better!
faith That's right, better. People need us to survive. In the balance, nobody's gonna cry over some random bystander who got caught in the crossfire.
buffy_summers I am.
faith Well, that's your loss.
joyce_summers Buffy.
detective_stein Tell me again. You got home at what time last night?
buffy_summers Late. Um, a-a little past 1:00, I guess.
detective_stein Maybe you can explain to me what a girl your age is doing out all night.
faith Just hanging.
detective_stein Hanging. By yourself?
faith No. I was with my friend Buffy.
buffy_summers We were at Faith's watching TV.
detective_stein What did you watch?
faith Some old movie.
buffy_summers Infomercial.
detective_stein Hmm. That's funny 'cause I got a couple of witnesses who put you near the alley.
faith Witnesses?
detective_stein Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart.
detective_stein Strange thing is, the weapon, it was made out of wood.
detective_stein Stein: Any of this mean anything to you?
faith Yeah. That whoever did it wasn't hip to the Bronze Age.
buffy_summers Is that it? I'm kinda beat.
detective_stein Yeah, I have enough for now. Buffy, if you know something, if you're protecting someone, I promise you it'll be better for everyone if you just come clean.
faith You mean am I covering for someone? Hardly. I'm not the throw-myself-on-the-sword type.
buffy_summers I wish I could help you.
detective_stein Well, call me if you remember anything.
buffy_summers Hey.
willow_rosenberg Hey.
buffy_summers I need to talk to you.
willow_rosenberg Good. 'Cause I've been letting things fester. And I don't like it. I wanna be fester-free.
buffy_summers Yeah. Me, too.
willow_rosenberg I mean, don't get me wrong. I-I completely understand why you and Faith have been doing the bonding thing. You guys work together. You... You should get along.
buffy_summers It's more complicated than that.
willow_rosenberg But, see, it's that exact thing that-that's just ticking me off! It's this whole 'Slayers only' attitude. I mean, since when wouldn't I understand? You, you talk to me about *everything*. I-it's like all of a sudden I-I'm not cool enough for you because I can't kill things with my bare hands.
willow_rosenberg Oh! Oh, Buffy! Don't cry. I'm sorry. I-I was too hard on you. Sometimes I unleash. I-I don't know my own strength. I-i-it's bad. I-I-I'm bad. I'm a bad, bad, bad person.
buffy_summers Will, I'm in trouble.
buffy_summers And Faith acts like she doesn't even care. The way she talks, it's like she didn't even make a mistake.
willow_rosenberg Do you think she's, like, i-in shock?
buffy_summers I don't know. And I think that detective knows more than he's saying. I think he knew that I was lying.
willow_rosenberg You have to go to Giles, Buffy. He'll know what to do.
buffy_summers Giles?
rupert_giles Buffy.
buffy_summers Uh... I don't really know how to say this, so I'm-I'm... I'm just gonna say it. I know I've kept things from you before, but...
buffy_summers But, um, but I-I've been blowing off my classes. You know, in-in the sense of not attending. And, uh...
faith It's okay, Buffy. I told him.
buffy_summers You told him?
faith I had to. He had to know what you did.
buffy_summers What I did?
buffy_summers Giles, no. Tha-That's just not what happened.
rupert_giles I don't want to hear it, Buffy.
buffy_summers No! It...
rupert_giles I don't want to hear any more lies.
buffy_summers You can't be serious! You're setting me up?
rupert_giles Get in my office, now. Faith, I'll talk to you in the morning.
buffy_summers Giles, please, you have to...
rupert_giles Now!
faith Um... Sorry.
buffy_summers Giles, I didn't do this. I swear. Look, I know that I messed up badly, but the murder, i-it... it was...
rupert_giles Faith. I know.
rupert_giles She may have many talents, Buffy, but fortunately, lying is not one of them.
buffy_summers Oh. Oh, God. I thought...
rupert_giles I'm sorry. I needed her to think that I was on her side. I don't know how far she'll take this charade.
buffy_summers Try far. Like, all the way.
rupert_giles You should have come to me right off.
buffy_summers I know. Well, I, I wanted to.
rupert_giles But Faith wouldn't hear of it?
buffy_summers It's not all her fault, Giles. We both thought it was a vampire. I-I only realized it a second before.
rupert_giles Buffy, this is not the first time something like this has happened.
buffy_summers It's not?
rupert_giles The Slayer is on the front line of a nightly war. Now, it's, it's tragic, but accidents have happened.
buffy_summers W-what do you do?
rupert_giles Well, the Council investigates, um, metes out punishment if punishment is due. But I... I have no plans to involve them. I mean, it's the last thing Faith needs at the moment. She's unstable, Buffy. I mean, she's utterly unable to accept responsibility.
buffy_summers She's freaking. So, so then we just have to help her deal, right?
rupert_giles She's in denial. There *is* no help for her until she admits what happened.
buffy_summers I-I could talk to her.
rupert_giles Perhaps.
buffy_summers Or maybe I'm too close. Maybe, maybe one of the guys could.
rupert_giles We should meet. It-it may be that they're seeing a different side of her.
buffy_summers Okay.
rupert_giles In the meantime, no one else is to know. Understood?
buffy_summers Of course.
rupert_giles I mean, this is... extremely delicate. If we scare her off now, we may lose her forever.
wesley_wyndampryce Yes, hello. Mr. Travers, please. Quentin Travers. Wesley Wyndam-Pryce calling. The code word? Monkey. M-o-n-k... Just put him on, will you? This is an emergency.
willow_rosenberg Well, maybe we should all talk to Faith together.
buffy_summers You mean, like that intervention thing that you guys did on me? As I recall, Xander and I nearly came to blows.
xander_harris Uh, *you* nearly came to blows, Buffy. I nearly came to loss of limbs.
rupert_giles No, Faith is too defensive for a confrontation like that. She'll respond better to a one-on-one approach.
xander_harris Well, *I* can be the one... on her one. Let's rephrase. I think she might listen to me. We kind of have, um, a connection.
buffy_summers A connection? Why would you think that...
xander_harris I'm just saying it's worth a shot. That's all.
rupert_giles No, I don't, I don't see it, Xander. I mean, of, of all of us, you're the one person arguably that Faith has had the least contact with.
xander_harris Yeah, but we hung out a little... recently, and she seemed to be, um... responsive.
buffy_summers When did you guys hang out?
xander_harris Oh, she was fighting one of those, uh, apocalypse demon things, and I helped her. Gave her a ride home.
buffy_summers And you guys talked?
xander_harris Not extensively. No.
buffy_summers Then why would you... Oh.
rupert_giles Oh!
willow_rosenberg I don't need to say 'oh'. I got it before. They slept together.
rupert_giles Fine, fine, let's, let's, let's move on.
buffy_summers Alright. Look, I-I know that you mean well, Xander, but, um, I-I just don't see Faith opening up to you. She doesn't take the guys that she has a... 'connection' with very seriously. And they're, they're kind of a big joke to her. No offense.
xander_harris Oh, no! I mean, why would I be offended by *that*?
rupert_giles However, i-if you still want to be of assistance, I, I, I need some help with research. There's still the business of the Mayor and Mr. Trick to attend to.
buffy_summers Yeah, they, they seemed pretty cozy the other night.
rupert_giles Yes. Uh, Willow, c-c-can you, um, access the Mayor's files?
willow_rosenberg What? Oh, uh, sure. I can try.
rupert_giles Good, yes, because clearly we, uh, we need to take a harder look at him. He's, he's, um, he's obviously up to something.
buffy_summers What about Faith?
rupert_giles I don't know. I need time.
buffy_summers She needs help now. I owe her that.
faith What?
xander_harris I just, uh, came by to see how you are, actually.
faith I'm sick of people asking me that, for one thing.
xander_harris Can I come in? Just to talk. I promise.
faith Like you could make something happen if I didn't want it to?
xander_harris Hey, yeah. Got me there. Pretty much not gonna try to... take you under any circumstances. See, here, feel that. Probably like a wet noodle to you, huh?
faith Five minutes.
xander_harris That's all I need. For talking and conversation. I'm, um, quick as a bunny.
faith Clock is running.
xander_harris It's just, uh... I heard about what happened, and I thought you might need a friend.
faith So then, go talk to Buffy. She's the one who killed a guy.
xander_harris Yeah. I heard that version.
faith Version?
xander_harris Either way, i-it sounds like it was an accident, and that's the important part.
faith No, the important part is that Buffy is the accidental murderer.
xander_harris Faith, you may not think so, but I sort of know you. And I've seen you post-battle. And I know firsthand that you're, um... like a wild thing. And half the time, you don't know what you're doing.
faith And you're living proof of that, aren't you?
xander_harris See, you're trying to hurt me. But right now, you need someone on your side. What happened wasn't your fault. And I'm willing to testify to that in court if you need me.
faith You'd dig that, wouldn't you? To get up in front of all your geek pals and go on record about how I made you my boy toy for a night.
xander_harris No. N-n-n-n-no, that's not it.
faith *I* know what this is all about. You just came by here 'cause you want another taste, don't you?
xander_harris No! I mean, it was nice. It was great. It was kind of a blur. But, okay, some day, sure, yay, but not now. Not like this.
faith More like how then? Lights on or off? Kinks or vanilla?
xander_harris Faith, come on. I came here to help you. I thought we had a connection.
faith You wanna feel a connection? It's just skin. I see... I want... I take. I forget.
xander_harris No. No, wait. It was more than that.
faith I could do anything to you right now, and you want me to. I can make you scream.
faith I could make you die.
faith Finally decided to tie me up, huh? I always knew you weren't really a one-Slayer guy.
angel I'm sorry about the chains. It's not that I don't trust you... Actually, it *is* that I don't trust you.
faith The thing with Xander; I know what it looked like, but we were just playing.
angel And he forgot the safety word. Is that it?
faith Safety words are for wusses.
angel I bet you're not big on trust games, now, are you, Faith?
faith You gonna shrink me now? Is that it?
angel No, I just wanna talk to you.
faith That's what they all say. And then it's just, 'Lemme stay the night. Won't try anything.'
angel You wanna go the long way around, hey, I can do that. I'm not getting any older.
buffy_summers How's she doing?
angel It's like talking to a wall. Only you get more from a wall.
buffy_summers But you'll keep trying, right?
angel Sure. We're just getting started.
buffy_summers So, what do I do?
angel Look, right now, there's nothing that you can do.
buffy_summers Well, this could take awhile, right? So, I'll just go to Faith's and I'll get some of her stuff. That way she'll see that we're on her side.
angel That's a good idea.
buffy_summers Okay. I'll be back.
angel Look, I... I don't want you to get your hopes up, Buffy. She may not want us to help her.
buffy_summers She does. She just doesn't know how to say it.
angel She killed a man. That changes everything for her.
buffy_summers Giles said with counseling, they might not even need to lock her up.
angel That's not what I mean. She's taken a life.
buffy_summers I know.
angel She's got a taste for it now.
mayor_richard_wilkins Not one Slayer, but two. Right here in the building.
mr_trick There was supposed to be a guard.
mayor_richard_wilkins Sh. Here comes my favorite part. Where the Slayers see us in the hall together, thick as thieves. Oh, wait, we are thieves. And worse. And now they know it.
mr_trick Well, they're not gonna be much of a threat in jail.
mayor_richard_wilkins Well, we don't have near enough evidence to put 'em away.
mayor_richard_wilkins No, you're gonna have to come up with a more *efficient* solution. And Mr. Trick, you better think of it soon.
angel I know what's goin' on with you.
faith Join the club. Everybody seems to have a theory.
angel Hmm. But I know what it's like to take a life. To feel a future, a world of possibilities, snuffed out by your own hand. I know the power in it. The exhilaration. It was like a drug for me.
faith Yeah? Sounds like you need some help. A professional maybe.
angel Hmm. A professional couldn't have helped me. It stopped when I got my soul back. My human heart.
faith Goody for you. If we're gonna party, let's get on with it. Otherwise, could you let me out of these things?
angel Faith, you have a choice. You've tasted something few ever do. I mean, to kill without remorse is to feel like a god.
faith Right now, all I feel is a cramp in my wrist, so let me go!
angel But you're not a god. You're not much more than a child. Going down this path will ruin you. You can't imagine the price for true evil.
faith Yeah? I hope evil takes MasterCard.
angel You and me, Faith, we're a lot alike. Time was, I thought humans existed just to hurt each other. But then I came here. And I found out that there are other types of people. People who genuinely wanted to do right. And they make mistakes. And they fall down. You know, but they keep caring. Keep trying. If you can trust us, Faith, this can all change. You don't have to disappear into the darkness.
faith What?
wesley_wyndampryce By the order of the Watcher's Council of Britain... I am exercising my authority and removing you to England, where you will accept the judgment of the disciplinary committee.
wesley_wyndampryce I'm sorry for the extreme measures. Unfortunately, this is a rather extreme circumstance.
faith Whatever.
wesley_wyndampryce Please believe nobody is rushing to judgment. The first priority of both myself and the Council is to help you.
wesley_wyndampryce Ah, now, none of that. Tighten her restraints. Faith, there's no point in fighting this.
faith Have to disagree with you on that one. Now unlock these or I'll pop this guy's head like a grape.
faith Don't even think about it.
wesley_wyndampryce Faith, you can't keep running.
faith Wrong again, Wes.
angel It was the new Watcher. He had a couple of guys helping him.
willow_rosenberg Then he figured it out?
rupert_giles Which means that Faith will be soon on her way back to England to face the Watcher's Council.
buffy_summers And then what?
rupert_giles Most likely they'll lock her away for a good long while.
buffy_summers So we head them off at the airport and stop them.
willow_rosenberg Can I... I-I'm just wondering. Why? I'm not the most objective, I know. I kind of have an issue with Faith sharing my people. But she murdered someone and accused Buffy. Then she hurt Xander. I hate to say it, but maybe she belongs behind bars.
buffy_summers She's out of control, I know. But Angel was getting somewhere with her. She was opening up. If we could just stop Wesley.
wesley_wyndampryce That's no longer an issue.
rupert_giles You let her get away?
wesley_wyndampryce 'Let' wouldn't be the way I'd phrase it, but... Yes, she escaped.
angel That's good work. First, you terrorize her, then you put her back in the streets.
wesley_wyndampryce That was hardly my plan. I was trying to save her.
buffy_summers But you didn't! You probably destroyed her.
rupert_giles Buffy, that's enough.
buffy_summers I better find her before she does any more damage. We're gonna need to split up. I'll check the docks. That's probably where she is. Giles, why don't you go to her motel? Xander, Willow, her haunts and be careful.
angel I'll try the airport.
wesley_wyndampryce What can I do? I want to help.
buffy_summers You still got your ticket back to the mother country?
faith You don't give up, do you?
buffy_summers Not on my friends, no.
faith Yeah, because you and me are such solid buds, right?
buffy_summers We could be. It's not too late.
faith For me to change and be more like you, you mean? Little Miss Goody-Two-Shoes? It ain't gonna happen, B.
buffy_summers Faith, nobody is asking you to be like me, but you can't go on like this.
faith Scares you, doesn't it?
buffy_summers Yeah, it scares me. Faith, you're hurting people. You're hurting yourself.
faith But that's not it. That's not what bothers you so much. What bugs you is you know I'm right. You know in your gut we don't need the law. We *are* the law.
buffy_summers No.
faith Yes. You know exactly what I'm about 'cause you have it in you, too.
buffy_summers No, Faith, you're sick.
faith I've seen it, B. You've got the lust. And I'm not just talking about screwing vampires.
buffy_summers Don't you *dare* bring him into this.
faith It was good, wasn't it? The sex? The danger? Bet a part of you even dug him when he went psycho.
buffy_summers No!
faith See, you need me to toe the line because you're afraid you'll go over it, aren't you, B? You can't handle watching me living my own way, having a blast, because it tempts you! You know it could be you!
faith There's my girl.
buffy_summers No. I'm not gonna do this.
faith Why not? It feels good. Blood rising.
buffy_summers Oh, God...
mr_trick I hear once you've tasted a Slayer, you never wanna go back.
mr_trick Oh, no. No, this is no good at all.
rupert_giles So she saved you.
buffy_summers She could have left me there to die, Giles, but she didn't.
rupert_giles She opted to come back to town with you. That... That bodes well. She still has a lot to face before she can put this behind her.
buffy_summers I'm not gonna give up on her.
