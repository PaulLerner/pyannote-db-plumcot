dawn_summers Candles?! We can't have candles?
buffy_summers Dawn, it's magic clearance. Everything must go.
dawn_summers B-but they're just candles!
buffy_summers Well, yeah, you know, to you and me they're just candles, but to ... witches they're ... like bongs.
buffy_summers So, no candles, no charms ... no-
willow_rosenberg Bird.
buffy_summers No bird?
willow_rosenberg That peacock on the table. It has two crystals in it.
willow_rosenberg Tara, she... she left them.
buffy_summers I'll make sure she gets them.
buffy_summers Dawn, do me a favor, can you grab the fertility god statue on the desk over there?
dawn_summers Kokopelli?! No! I love him! And he was Mom's.
dawn_summers Why do we have to get rid of so many things I like?
buffy_summers Dawn, I explained this to you. Willow has a problem. The next few weeks are gonna be ... crazy hard on her as it is.
buffy_summers Any reminder of, of what it is that she's trying to stay away from, you know, could cause her to ... give in to temptation.
buffy_summers And that would be bad.
warren_meers Okay, that's it. It's finally done.
warren_meers I mean, it still needs a trial run, but it's-
jonathan_levinson Kind of clunky-looking.
warren_meers What?!
andrew_wells I pictured something cooler. More ILM, less Ed Wood.
warren_meers You wanna see cool? I'll show you cool.
jonathan_levinson Mama!
jonathan_levinson Did it ... is it...
andrew_wells Yeah.
jonathan_levinson I'd call that a successful test.
warren_meers Well, that's just half the test.
jonathan_levinson Hey! Hey!
jonathan_levinson You penis!
warren_meers Oh, cheer up, Frodo. Because thanks to my brains, and our mystical gem, we got ourselves an invisibility ray. And I'd say that makes us pretty much unstoppable.
buffy_summers Dawn, come on, you gotta eat breakfast! Xander's gonna be here any second.
buffy_summers She's gonna be late for school again.
buffy_summers How are you doing?
willow_rosenberg I'm okay. Not 'ready to head back to classes, face the world' okay, but ... the shakiness is only semi now. I thought I'd spend the day fishing the net, for more poop on the, uh, stolen diamond.
buffy_summers I called you before.
dawn_summers Didn't hear you.
willow_rosenberg Hey Dawnie, uh, I'm making you a nice omelet.
dawn_summers Not hungry.
buffy_summers Dawn, you need to eat something.
dawn_summers Thanks for your concern.
willow_rosenberg Okay, I deserve the wrath of Dawn, but ... why is she taking it out on you?
buffy_summers Because I let it happen.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, I was the one who-
buffy_summers Who was drowning. My best friend. And I was too wrapped up in my own dumb life to even notice.
spike Morning.
buffy_summers What are you doing? And, here?
spike Just, uh, took a stroll. Found myself in your neck of the woods.
buffy_summers Couldn't find a less flammable time of day to take a stroll?
spike Yeah, well, the fact is my lighter's gone missing. Thought it might have, uh, dropped outta my pocket the last time I was here.
buffy_summers Haven't seen it.
willow_rosenberg I'm, uh, gonna head back to my room, get dressed.
buffy_summers Oh, I...
buffy_summers Lame.
spike What?
buffy_summers You. Making up excuses.
spike Oh, don't flatter yourself, luv. Bloody fond of that lighter.
buffy_summers Stop trying to see me. And stop calling me that.
spike So, um ... what should I call you then? Pet?
spike Sweetheart? My, uh ... little goldilocks?
spike You know I love this hair. The way it bounces around when you-
spike Ah-ah-ah! This flapjack's not ready to be flipped.
buffy_summers What the hell is that supposed to-
buffy_summers Stop that.
xander_harris Good Godfrey Cambridge, Spike!
xander_harris Still trying to mack on Buffy? Wake up already. Never gonna happen! Only a complete loser would ever hook up with you. Well, unless she's a simpleton like Harmony, or a, or a nut sack like Drusilla-
buffy_summers Hey! You really need to get Dawn off to school. Let's go, go fetch her, okay?
buffy_summers You can let yourself out, right Spike?
buffy_summers Dawn! You better get going, Xander's here!
dawn_summers Here.
buffy_summers Okay, you have everything you need?
dawn_summers Yep.
buffy_summers And after school, you-
dawn_summers Yeah yeah. Let's go, Xander.
buffy_summers You will come straight home.
dawn_summers Sure. Maybe we can find some time for you to get me into another car accident.
doris_kroeger Oh, good morning. You must be Dawn.
buffy_summers Can I help you?
doris_kroeger I'm Doris Kroger, from Social Services. We had an appointment?
buffy_summers Oh, for Wednesday.
doris_kroeger This is Wednesday.
buffy_summers Right! Well ... Dawn, you better...
buffy_summers And, and Xander, you'll drive safely?
xander_harris Yes ma'am.
doris_kroeger Little bit on the tardy side, isn't she?
buffy_summers Yeah, well, uh, it's been one of those mornings, you know. Hey, come on in.
buffy_summers Sorry about the mess, you know, doing a little house-cleaning.
spike So, we gonna chat this out, or what?
buffy_summers Uh ... now's really not a-a good time. Um, I have company.
spike No worries. I'll wait.
doris_kroeger Um, Miss Summers, if you and your boyfriend would like to-
buffy_summers He is NOT-
buffy_summers Not my, my boyfriend, he's, um, just ... a...
buffy_summers Spike ... this nice woman is, uh, from Social Services?
spike Oh, right! Uh ... hey! Buffy's a great mom. She takes good care of her little sis. Like, um, when Dawn was hanging out too much in my crypt, Buffy put a right stop to it.
doris_kroeger I'm sorry, did you say-
buffy_summers Crib! He said crib. You know kids today and their buggin' street slang.
buffy_summers Uh, Spike, didn't you have to go now, you know, because of that thing?
spike Uh, thing, yeah. Uh, my blanket.
doris_kroeger He sleeps here?
buffy_summers What? No! No. Oh, uh, the, the, the blanket. That's, um, uh, it's a security thing, you know. He ... has issues. Nope, just me and Dawn living here.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, I'm not feeling hot, so uh, I'm gonna take a quick nap, okay?
buffy_summers Okay, Will!
buffy_summers That's Willow. She, uh, she kind of lives here too, actually.
doris_kroeger Oh, so you live with another woman.
buffy_summers Oh! Oh, it's not a, a gay thing, you know, I mean, well...
buffy_summers ...she's gay, but, but we don't ... gay. Not that there's anything - Oh! Wrong with... You know, I know what that looks like, but I, I swear, it's not ... what it looks like. It's *magic* weed.
buffy_summers It's not mine.
doris_kroeger I think I've seen enough.
buffy_summers No, a-actually, I really don't think that you have. It's just ... i-it's been kind of, kind of a, a bad time.
doris_kroeger It's been a bad time now for a while, hasn't it, Ms. Summers? Your sister's grades have fallen sharply in the last year, due in large part to her frequent absences and lateness.
buffy_summers But there-there are good reasons.
doris_kroeger Oh, I'm sure there are. But my interest is in Dawn's welfare. And the stability of her home life, something I'm just not convinced that an unemployed young woman like yourself can provide.
buffy_summers I can. I, I do!
doris_kroeger Well, we'll just have to see about that then, won't we?
doris_kroeger Oh, and I'm, uh, going to recommend immediate probation in my report.
buffy_summers What does that mean?
doris_kroeger It means that I'll be monitoring you very closely, Ms. Summers. And if I don't see that things are improving, well, I'll be forced to recommend that you be stripped of your sister's guardianship.
buffy_summers You can't do that.
doris_kroeger I do what is in Dawn's best interest ... as should you. Have a nice day.
spike Didn't go well, huh?
buffy_summers Why won't you go?
spike I just thought you'd want-
buffy_summers Get out of here!
spike Just getting what I came for, luv.
spike So long, goldilocks.
cleo Well, I-I think I can work with this.
cleo What exactly would you like me to do?
buffy_summers Just make me ... different.
andrew_wells I'm scared, what if we get caught?
jonathan_levinson No way, we'll be invisible. Plus their security's gotten lax.
warren_meers You should know. You've cased this joint enough.
warren_meers Okay, this is it.
warren_meers Remember...
warren_meers ...we're professionals.
andrew_wells Uh, Slayer!
warren_meers What? Wh-where?
andrew_wells There. Headed this way.
jonathan_levinson Give it!
andrew_wells No, I need to be invisible!
jonathan_levinson I need it more, Buffy can't see me!
warren_meers Hey, watch it, don't you-
andrew_wells Oopsie.
xander_harris What happened to Buffy? She's gone.
anya She's right here.
anya Table four. I put her with your family.
xander_harris Great. Except, we don't hate Buffy.
xander_harris Let's put her back at table one.
anya Well, where do I put D'Hoffryn?
xander_harris We're not inviting D'Hoffryn.
anya We have to, he's my ex-boss! You're inviting your work buddies.
buffy_summers She's got a point.
xander_harris Hey, Buffy...
xander_harris Where ... where are you?
buffy_summers At table four, apparently.
anya Well, that remains to be seen. Like you.
buffy_summers Don't strain yourself looking, Xander. I'm invisible girl.
buffy_summers Uh, Xander?
xander_harris Sorry! Her clothes are ... invisible ... too. Buffy, how did this hap ... wait a sec, have you been feeling ... ignored lately?
buffy_summers Yeah, ignored. I wish. No, this isn't a Marcie deal. I don't know what happened. I left Main Street after getting my hair cut, and-
anya You cut your hair?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah!
anya Really? How short?
buffy_summers Um, about up to here ... well, if you could see my hand, it's kind of above my shoulders.
anya Ahh, that sounds so adorable! I was thinking about getting my hair cut before the wed-
xander_harris Can we get back to freaking out about no-show Buffy? This is serious.
buffy_summers I know. It kind of fits the day I've had.
buffy_summers Willow's still a wreck, Dawn's mad at both of us, and the social services lady put me through a wringer. Says she's gonna watch me. I'd like to see her try now.
buffy_summers You know, there may be an upside to no-see-me.
xander_harris Buff, did you say anyone, or ... anything suspicious before you ... cleared out?
buffy_summers Nope, didn't see nothin'. See what I did there, with the eyeballs?
anya Why would anyone make her invisible anyway? I mean, invisible Slayer's gotta be way more effective than the standard variety.
xander_harris Yeah, I'm less with the why and more with the how. We get the how, then we got how to make her unseen sight seen again, right?
buffy_summers 'Saright!
xander_harris Buffy, could you focus please?
buffy_summers I am! Just ... this is kind of fun.
anya Well, it would help if we had a little bit more to go on. Or ... anything to go on.
xander_harris Well, I could go check the spot where Buffy disappeared. Snoop for clues.
buffy_summers Yeah, right. Uh, hey, you know what? I'm just gonna ... go for a walk.
xander_harris A walk?
buffy_summers Yeah. Um, clear my head. You guys keep working on those whats and hows. Clear my head.
xander_harris Buffy!
anya Well, seems pretty obvious it's some kind of spell that's done this to her.
xander_harris Spell from who? You said it yourself, it makes no sense for one of her enemies to make her invisible.
anya Maybe it's a mistake.
xander_harris A magical mistake. Who'd be messing with that kind of pow-
xander_harris Willow.
willow_rosenberg Xander!
xander_harris How's it going?
willow_rosenberg Um ... good. I, I, uh, found ... out some stuff about the diamond stolen from the museum. It's called the Illuminata, and there's rumors of it having quasi-mystical quantum properties.
xander_harris Willow, we need to talk.
willow_rosenberg We ... are talking. Well, I'm talking and you're looking at me funny.
xander_harris Is there something you wanna tell me?
willow_rosenberg It was nothing, I ... I-I didn't slip.
xander_harris Will, nobody's mad. Relapse is a part of recovery, we understand that. We just have to figure a way to fix it.
willow_rosenberg Fix what?
xander_harris Fix Buffy.
willow_rosenberg Buffy's broken?
xander_harris Will, you know what I'm talki - You don't know.
xander_harris Rhymes with ... 'blinvisible'?
willow_rosenberg What?
xander_harris Buffy was in town, leaving the haircutting place, when she suddenly just-
willow_rosenberg Buffy got her hair cut?
xander_harris Yeah! Adorable, apparently. I personally couldn't tell, since she's all 'blinvisible.'
willow_rosenberg And you think I had something to do with this?
xander_harris Uh, no ... not ... Well, come on, Will. Some of the spells you've done have caused some weird stuff to happen to each of us at one time or another. And let's not forget the recent forgetting.
willow_rosenberg Oh. I see, so now when anything nasty happens, I get conveniently blamed for it?
xander_harris No one's blaming!
willow_rosenberg So ... I guess it wouldn't matter if I just jump off the wagon completely ... since you already think I'm making pit stops.
xander_harris Well, look, if you said you didn't do it - Willow, where you going?
willow_rosenberg For a walk.
warren_meers Couple of circuits are burned out, and the wiring's all fried.
andrew_wells But we had so many plans. Naked women, and all ... well, all-all the naked women. This is all your fault, if you hadn't grabbed it from me-
jonathan_levinson Hey, we got a lot bigger problems here, bonehead. The Slayer's invisible now?
andrew_wells He's right. She could be anywhere. Even here, right now.
andrew_wells Watching. Listening to every word we say. For all we know, she could be one of us!
andrew_wells Oh, wait, no, guys, that isn't true.
warren_meers I wouldn't sweat the Slayer too much.
jonathan_levinson Says you. In my book an invisible slayer means a whole world of trouble.
buffy_summers I am the ghost of fashion victims past. Studded caps? Not a good idea.
buffy_summers Hey! I'm doing you a favor!
buffy_summers Naah ... too easy.
buffy_summers Hmm...
buffy_summers So long, copper!
COP#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 Hey ... Hey! That's mine! Stop!
buffy_summers Hello, Mrs. Kroger.
doris_kroeger What - Where's my...
doris_kroeger Losing my mind.
doris_kroeger Okay, who's the-
buffy_summers Kill, kill, kill!
doris_kroeger What?
coworker I didn't say anything.
doris_kroeger Not you! The mug, it's-
doris_kroeger But I ... I heard something.
buffy_summers Kill, Doris. Kill everybody.
buffy_summers You know you want to.
doris_kroeger Shut up, shut up, just shut up!
buffy_summers Okay ... no ... no...
buffy_summers Yahtzee!
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 Uh, Doris!
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 I've, uh, got a few, so if you wanna discuss that case file now...
doris_kroeger What? Oh! Oh yes, the, um, Summers file, it's, uh, it's right over here.
doris_kroeger Uh, it's a fifteen-year-old girl, living under her older sister's guardianship. The house is a complete-
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 What is this? 'All work and no play make Doris a dull girl'?
doris_kroeger What?
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 'All work and no play make Doris' - the pages are filled with it.
doris_kroeger I ... I...
doris_kroeger I, I, I didn't do this, I ...
doris_kroeger It was the voice.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 Excuse me?
doris_kroeger There was a voice, before. It made my coffee dance. It told me to-
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 To ... what?
doris_kroeger Nothing.
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 Doris ... take the rest of the day off. See your doctor.
doris_kroeger But what about my cases?
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 We'll, uh ... put someone else on them. And have them redo the Summers interview.
doris_kroeger I'm not crazy. I am not crazy!
BOSS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 Well, no one said that you were.
xander_harris Hey Will. Whatcha doin'?
willow_rosenberg Look, Xander, I - I figured out this was where Buffy disappeared from what you told me, so don't start jumping to any conclusions.
xander_harris No jumping, look, feet firmly planted.
willow_rosenberg I'm not feeling like myself right now, sorry.
xander_harris Me too. Sorry. So! What have we found out so far?
willow_rosenberg Well, take a look at that!
willow_rosenberg Something sped outta here pretty dann quick to, to make that kind of tread mark.
xander_harris Well, this could have been made any time.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, but this ... wasn't.
xander_harris What is it?
willow_rosenberg Paint that I scraped off the fire hydrant.
xander_harris What fire hydrant? Ow!
willow_rosenberg That one.
willow_rosenberg Whatever hit this fire hydrant hit it after it was made invisible. And betcha by golly wow, that something was the same something that shot out of that alley.
xander_harris Black paint? Buffy's phantom van. We gotta let Buffy - whoa!
xander_harris There's something there.
willow_rosenberg I-it's a pylon, one of those orange traffic cones. You should take it to the Magic Box. It might help you and Anya figure out what kind of spell was used.
xander_harris What about you?
willow_rosenberg Well, I got paint scrapings... ...and a tire mark. I'm gonna find this van that's been stalking Buffy. By the way, where *is* Buffy?
WOMAN_ON_TV#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 Oh my god, the blood! Look at all the blood!
spike Whatever beastie you are, I know you're here. And I hurt beasties.
Invisible_Buffy's_POV#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season06.Episode11 moving past Spike from behind, looking down toward his butt and then onward.
spike Hey, watch it.
spike A ghost, is it? Go and haunt the living, like a good spook.
spike Buffy?
buffy_summers I told you ... stop trying to see me.
anya Oh, I got it!
xander_harris Really?
anya Yeah, we'll put D'Hoffryn at your parents' table, and move your Uncle Rory to table five near the bar.
xander_harris Ahn honey, we're looking for invisibility spells here.
anya Well, obviously I haven't found anything yet. At least nothing that would explain why things near Buffy become invisible.
anya Ew! Xander!
xander_harris What happened?
anya An unpleasant tactile experience, like putting my hand in pudding.
xander_harris Ew!
anya Like pudding, am I right? Rice, or tapioca, lumpy like that.
xander_harris We have to find Buffy, she's gotta know.
anya I don't think Buffy's gonna be too broken up over a pylon.
xander_harris Anya, whatever's happening to the pylon will probably happen to her. If we don't find Buffy, I-I mean ... if we don't figure out how this was done...
anya She's pudding?
jonathan_levinson What do you mean she's gonna fade away?
warren_meers The Slayer got slammed with a big-ass dose of radiation when the gun overloaded. Her cells are mutating at an accelerated rate. Eventually her molecular makeup will start losing its integrity and then ... pfft.
andrew_wells But, wouldn't that kill her?
warren_meers Well, lemme think. Yeah!
jonathan_levinson Wait a minute! We're not killing anybody. Especially not Buffy!
warren_meers You guys are so immature! We're villains! When are you gonna get that through your thick skulls?
jonathan_levinson We're not killers, we're crime lords!
andrew_wells Yeah! Like, like Lex Luthor. He's always trying to take over Metropolis, but he doesn't kill Superman!
warren_meers Because it's Superman's book, you moron!
andrew_wells But Lex doesn't kill him, does he?!
jonathan_levinson Listen, Warren ... you get that ray working and the first thing we're gonna do is find Buffy and re-visible her before it's too late!
jonathan_levinson You got me?!
warren_meers Fine.
warren_meers Whatever you guys say.
xander_harris Spike?
xander_harris Spike?
xander_harris What are you doing?
spike What am I ... What does it look like I'm doing, you nit? I'm exercising, aren't I?
xander_harris Exercising. Naked. In bed.
spike A man shouldn't use immortality as an excuse to let himself go. Gotta keep fit for the killing.
xander_harris Yuh-huh. Looks like you had a little trouble upstairs. Mini-disaster area.
spike So what, you just come here to criticize my housekeeping?
xander_harris No, uh, no. I'm looking for Buf-
spike Haven't seen her.
xander_harris Well, uh, you wouldn't. The fact is, she's come down with a slight case of invisibility.
spike Yeah? How did, uh...
xander_harris We don't know yet.
xander_harris Anyway, she's not at the house, and I really, really need to find her.
spike Uh, tell you what, I'll ... take a peek around first chance I get... and if we bump into each other, I'll clue her that you're on the lookout.
xander_harris After your ... exercises.
spike Yeah, right.
xander_harris You know, kidding aside, Spike ... you really should get a girlfriend.
spike That was bloody stupid.
buffy_summers What's the matter? Ashamed to be seen with me?
buffy_summers Come on. He had no idea I was here. This is perfect.
spike Perfect for you.
buffy_summers Well, picture me confused. I thought this was what you wanted.
spike What I want...
spike This vanishing act's right liberating for you, innit? Go anywhere you want. Do anything you want. Or anyone.
buffy_summers What are you talking ab-
spike The only reason you're here, is that you're not here.
buffy_summers Right. Of course, as usual there's something wrong with Buffy. She came back all wrong. You know, I didn't ask for this to happen to me.
spike Not too put off by it though, are you?
buffy_summers No! Maybe because for the first time since ... I'm free.
buffy_summers Free of rules and reports ... free of this life.
spike Free of life? Got another name for that. Dead.
buffy_summers Why do you always have to ... I thought we were having fun.
spike Yeah, now! But sooner or later your chums are gonna work out a way to bring you back to living color. You need to go. Get dressed if you can find your clothes, and push off. 'Cause if I can't have all of you, I'd rather-
spike Okay, that's cheating.
buffy_summers I don't believe this.
buffy_summers He threw *me* out? He threw *me*. Did I, like, fall into some ... backward dimension here? Is this Bizarro World? And after he's always going on and on about being the only one that understands me. 'We're alike, you and me. Birds of a bloody feather.' Uh! He's so ...
buffy_summers Hey, I'm walking here!
buffy_summers Insensitive! That's what he is.
buffy_summers Willow? Willow! Dawn? Hey, Dawn, come here. You wanna see something neat?
buffy_summers There you are!
dawn_summers Buffy? W-where are you?
buffy_summers I'm invisible. Check this out.
buffy_summers Wooo, wooo! Unidentified flying pizza, comin' in for a landing.
dawn_summers W-what are you talking-
buffy_summers Okay, not the most clever ad lib, but come on! Points for spontaneity.
dawn_summers Stop it! Just ... stop.
buffy_summers Sorry Dawn. I'm, I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to freak you out.
dawn_summers Well, what did you think would happen? You're freaking invisible, Buffy.
buffy_summers I know. Xander and Anya are working on it. Muldering out what happened.
dawn_summers Well, what about you? Shouldn't you be working on it?
buffy_summers Of course I-
dawn_summers Do you even care about, about who did this to you, or, or if you're gonna be stuck this way? You're making jokes and flying pizzas.
buffy_summers I don't think that's-
dawn_summers I can't talk to you like this. I can't see you! How can I talk to you if I can't see you?
buffy_summers Dawn! Dawn!
xander_harris Buffy, it's Xander. Where are you? Listen ... we got a new problem here.
anya Tell her!
xander_harris I'm trying to. Anya and I think whatever made you invisible is slowly killing you.
anya Tell her about the pudding!
xander_harris Anya! Buff, if we don't ... if this isn't reversed, you're gonna ... well, dissolve, or ... fade ... into nothing.
buffy_summers Wow.
warren_meers Now!
willow_rosenberg Hey! Let go of me!
warren_meers Congratulations. You're our first hostage.
buffy_summers Dawn, I'm going out to find Xander. If he calls me-
buffy_summers Xander?
jonathan_levinson Don't talk. Just listen, Slayer. You don't have a lot of time.
buffy_summers Who is this? You sound familiar.
jonathan_levinson I'm ... nobody. No one you know. We've got your friend Willow, and if you don't want anything nasty to happen to her, you better meet us. Alone.
buffy_summers Where?
warren_meers Just stay still, and you won't get hurt.
buffy_summers You okay, Will?
willow_rosenberg Buffy?
buffy_summers Where are the bad guys?
warren_meers All around you, Slayer, so don't try anything.
willow_rosenberg He's bluffing, Buffy, there, there's just three of them, I think.
warren_meers More than enough to cause some serious carnage, right guys? ... Guys? Guys!
jonathan_levinson Kick! Use the kick!
andrew_wells I tried that, he keeps blocking it with his drunken monkey fist!
buffy_summers Ooh, scary video carnage.
warren_meers Hey! Slayer's here.
andrew_wells Sorry, didn't see her.
warren_meers Why don't we continue this in a less crowded area, like, over there.
all@ Where?
warren_meers Over ... follow me.
willow_rosenberg Ow!
buffy_summers I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you guys are the ones who did this to me?
jonathan_levinson It was an accident!
buffy_summers Who's that?
jonathan_levinson Nobody you know.
willow_rosenberg They're the ones from your mystery van.
buffy_summers Oh. You. So what annoying thing are you gonna do to me now?
warren_meers Save your life, make you visible.
buffy_summers Right. I'm supposed to believe that?
willow_rosenberg They told me everything, Buffy. Something's happening to you that, you're-
buffy_summers Fading away. I know.
warren_meers I can fix that.
warren_meers Pick up that air hockey mallet on the table.
buffy_summers What for?
warren_meers It'll give me a target to aim at.
warren_meers Okay, now hold still, and all your troubles will soon be gone.
willow_rosenberg You're on the wrong setting!
warren_meers What?
willow_rosenberg The gun, it's not set for reversing the particle ionization. It'll accelerate her molecular dissolution, I saw the plans!
warren_meers Mind your own business.
jonathan_levinson What's she talking about?
buffy_summers That's what I'd like to know.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, he's trying to kill you!
buffy_summers Willow!
warren_meers Ow!
buffy_summers Okay, play time's over.
warren_meers You haven't won yet, Slayer.
buffy_summers No, that part comes after I beat the snot out of you.
warren_meers You'll have to find me first! There's three of us, against just one of you.
jonathan_levinson Hey, you lied to us!
andrew_wells Fight her yourself!
warren_meers Think she cares about that? I go down, we all go down!
buffy_summers And I promise, you're all going down.
warren_meers We may not have your powers, Slayer, but you'll find that we are not so easy to- Ow! Get her!
jonathan_levinson Wait a minute, wait a minute! Who's biting my leg?
andrew_wells Sorry! Where is she?
buffy_summers Here.
warren_meers She can't find us if we split up.
warren_meers You go that way.
jonathan_levinson Which way?
warren_meers That way! Over-
buffy_summers Just keep talking, boys.
jonathan_levinson Ow! Watch the chest hair!
buffy_summers I know that voice. You-you're-
buffy_summers Jonathan?!
buffy_summers You have chest hair?
buffy_summers Warren?
buffy_summers Who are you?
andrew_wells Andrew.
andrew_wells I summoned the flying monkeys that attacked the high school?
andrew_wells During the school play, you know?
warren_meers It's Tucker's brother.
jonathan_levinson Yeah, it's Tucker's brother.
buffy_summers@willow_rosenberg Ohh.
buffy_summers So you three have, what, banded together to be pains in my ass?
warren_meers We're your arch-nemesises ... ses. You may have beaten us this time, Slayer, but next time ... um ... uh, next time...
jonathan_levinson Maybe not!
warren_meers What do you mean, it's locked? You were supposed to check it!
andrew_wells I forgot!
buffy_summers I give you my arch nemesises...ses.
security_guard What's going on in here? I got a bunch of scared kids saying this place is haunted!
willow_rosenberg Oh my god, Buffy!
buffy_summers I know, they're gone. I guess we should chase them.
willow_rosenberg No, your hair! It *is* adorable.
buffy_summers Pretty neat, you finding the van. So ... how did you manage to ... do it exactly? I mean, to locate it?
willow_rosenberg The hard way. The spell-free way. The oh-my-god-my-head's-gonna-fall-off, my-feet-are-killing-me way.
willow_rosenberg I don't know how I got through this day.
buffy_summers Well, the important thing is that you did. It's a ... good first step.
willow_rosenberg How are you doing, post-invisibleness?
buffy_summers Okay. I still have to do some damage control from my giddy-fest. Dawn was pretty freaked out. The whole taking-a-vacation-from-me thing didn't work out so well.
willow_rosenberg Tell me about it.
buffy_summers Except ... when I got Xander's message ... you know, that I was ... fading away ... I actually got scared.
willow_rosenberg Well, yeah. Who wouldn't?
buffy_summers Me. I wouldn't. Not too long ago I probably would have welcomed it. But I realized ... I'm not saying that I'm doing back-flips about my life, but... I didn't ... I don't ... wanna die. That's something, right?
willow_rosenberg It's something.
willow_rosenberg So I guess we both made good first steps.
buffy_summers I guess.
willow_rosenberg Yay for us.
buffy_summers Yay.
