spike I'm not happy, pet. Angel and the Slayer are still alive. They know where we are, they know about the Judge. We should be vacating.
drusilla Nonsense. They'll not disturb us here. My Angel's too smart to face the Judge again.
spike What's Big Blue up to anyway? He just sits there.
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 I am preparing.
spike Yeah. It's interesting to me that 'preparing' looks a great bit like sitting on your ass. When do we destroy the world already?
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 My strength grows, and with every life I take it will increase further.
spike So let's take some. I'm bored.
spike Dru?
drusilla Angel...
spike Dru? What is it? Dru!
spike Darling... Do you see something?
buffy_summers Angel?
angel Buffy...
angel Oh, no.
Hooker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 Hey. You okay? You want me to call 911?
angel No. The pain is gone.
Hooker#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 You sure?
angel Yeah.
angel I feel just fine.
joyce_summers Morning.
buffy_summers Morning.
joyce_summers So, did you have fun last night?
buffy_summers Fun?
joyce_summers At Willow's.
buffy_summers Yeah. Yeah, fun at Willow's. You know, she's a fun machine.
joyce_summers You hungry?
buffy_summers No. Uh, no, I-I'm, uh, just gonna go take a shower.
joyce_summers Well, i-if you hurry, I'll run you to school.
buffy_summers Thanks.
joyce_summers Is something wrong?
buffy_summers No. What would be wrong?
joyce_summers I don't know. You just look...
xander_harris Well, the bus depot was a total washout. And may I say what a lovely place to spend the night. What a vibrant cross-section of Americana.
rupert_giles No vampires transporting boxes?
xander_harris No, but a four-hundred-pound wino offered to wash my hair. What's up? Where's Buffy?
willow_rosenberg She never checked in.
rupert_giles If the bus depot is as empty as the... docks and the airport...
xander_harris Do you think this Judge guy's already been assembled?
rupert_giles Yes.
xander_harris Then Buffy could be... Okay, we gotta find 'em. Um, we gotta go to that place, that, uh, that factory. That's where they're holed up, right? Let's go.
cordelia_chase And do what? Besides be afraid and die.
xander_harris Well, nobody's asking you to go, Cordelia. If the vampires need grooming tips we'll give you a call.
rupert_giles Cordelia has a point. Now, i-i-if Buffy and Angel were, were... harmed, then we don't stand to fare much better.
xander_harris Yeah? Well, those of us who were born with feelings are gonna do something about this.
jenny_calendar Xander.
willow_rosenberg No, Xander's right! My God, you people are all... Well, I'm upset, and I can't think of a mean word right now, but that's what you are, and we're going to the factory!
xander_harris Yeah!
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
xander_harris We were just going to rescue you.
willow_rosenberg Well, some of us were.
rupert_giles Well, I-I would have.
jenny_calendar Where's Angel?
buffy_summers He didn't check in with you guys?
rupert_giles No.
cordelia_chase What happened?
rupert_giles The Judge, i-is he...
buffy_summers No assembly required. He's active.
rupert_giles Oh, damn it.
buffy_summers He nearly killed us. Angel got us out.
rupert_giles Why didn't you call? We, we, we thought...
buffy_summers Well, we, we had to hide. Uh, we got stuck in the sewer tunnels, and with the hiding, we just split up... Uh, no one's heard from him?
willow_rosenberg I'm sure he'll come by.
buffy_summers Yeah, I'm, I'm sure you're right.
rupert_giles Buffy, the Judge, we, we must stop him.
buffy_summers I know.
rupert_giles What can you tell us?
buffy_summers Not much. I, um... I kicked him. It was just like a sudden fever. If he'd got his hands on me...
rupert_giles In time, he won't need to. The stronger he gets, he'll be able to reduce us to charcoal with a look.
buffy_summers Also, not the prettiest man in town.
rupert_giles I better continue researching, must look for a weak spot. The rest of you should get to your classes.
jenny_calendar Yeah, I better go, too.
xander_harris Yeah, yeah, yeah.
willow_rosenberg Buffy, wait up!
jenny_calendar I'll, uh, go on the 'Net and search for anything on the Judge.
rupert_giles Thank you.
xander_harris After classes I'll come back and help you research.
cordelia_chase Yeah, you might find something useful if it's in an 'I Can Read' book.
willow_rosenberg You don't think Angel would have gone after the Judge himself, do you?
buffy_summers No, he'd know better than that. Maybe he just needed... I don't know. I just, I wish he'd contact me. I need to talk to him.
spike Are we feeling better, then?
drusilla I'm naming all the stars.
spike You can't see the stars, love. That's the ceiling. Also, it's day.
drusilla I can see them. But I've named them all the same name. And there's terrible confusion.
spike Did you see any further? Do you know what happens to Angel?
angel Well, he moves to New York and tries to fulfill that Broadway dream. It's tough sledding, but one day he's working in the chorus when the big star twists her ankle.
spike You don't give up, do you?
angel As long as there's injustice in the world, as long as scum like you is walking... well, rolling the streets... I'll be around. Look over your shoulder. I'll be there.
spike Uh, yeah. Angel, um... look over *your* shoulder.
spike Hurts, doesn't it?
angel Well, you know, it kinda itches a little.
spike Don't just stand there. Burn him.
angel Gee, maybe he's broken.
spike What the hell is going on?
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 This one... cannot be burnt. He is clean.
spike Clean? You mean, he's...
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 There's no humanity in him.
angel I couldn't have said it better myself.
drusilla Angel.
angel Yeah, baby. I'm back.
spike Is it really true?
angel It's really true.
drusilla You've come home.
spike No more of this 'I've got a soul' crap?
angel What can I say, hmm? I was going through a phase.
spike This is great! This is so great!
drusilla Everything in my head is singing! We're family again. We'll feed. Grrr. And we'll play.
spike I've got to tell you, it made me sick to my stomach seeing you being the Slayer's lap dog.
drusilla How did this happen?
angel You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
spike Oh, who cares? What matters is now he's back! Now it's four against one, which are the kind of odds I like to play.
drusilla Psst. We're going to destroy the world. Want to come?
angel Yeah. Destroying the world. Great. I'm really more interested in the Slayer.
spike Well, she's *in* the world, so that should work out.
angel Give me tonight. Hmm?
spike What do you mean?
angel Lay low for a night. I guarantee you by the time you go public she won't be anything resembling a threat.
spike You've really got a yen to hurt this girl, haven't you?
angel She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you just forgive.
willow_rosenberg Ok. No, no, he didn't, but I'm sure he'll... Well, Buffy, he probably has some plan, and he's trying to protect you. Well, I-I don't know what. I'm not in on the plan. It's his plan. No. Don't even say that! Angel is not dead.
xander_harris Say 'hi' for me.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, of course we'll be here. Okay, bye. Say 'hi' for me?
xander_harris What's the word?
willow_rosenberg She's checked every place she can think of. She even beat up Willy the snitch a couple of times. Angel's vanished.
rupert_giles But he does do that on occasion, no?
willow_rosenberg Oh, yeah, but she's extra wigged this time. I guess 'cause of her dreams. God, what if something really happened to him?
rupert_giles Is she gonna join us here?
willow_rosenberg Yeah. She's just stopping at home first.
xander_harris Nada.
xander_harris Did you find anything?
cordelia_chase This book mentions the Judge, but nothing useful. Big, scary, no weapon forged can stop him, took an army to take him down. Blah, blah, blah.
xander_harris We need some insight, a weak spot.
cordelia_chase Well, we're not gonna find it here.
xander_harris Sorry I snapped at you before.
cordelia_chase Well, I'm reeling from that new experience.
xander_harris I was crazed. I wasn't thinking.
cordelia_chase I know. You were too busy rushing off to die for your beloved Buffy. You'd never die for me.
xander_harris No, I might die *from* you. Does that get me any points?
cordelia_chase No.
xander_harris Come on, can't we just kiss and make up?
cordelia_chase I don't wanna make up. But I'm okay with the other part.
xander_harris Willow, uh...
xander_harris We were just... Willow! Willow!
xander_harris Willow, come on!
willow_rosenberg I knew it! I knew it! Well, not 'knew it' in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn't know. You two were fighting way too much. It's not natural!
xander_harris I know it's weird...
willow_rosenberg Weird? It's against all laws of God and Man! It's Cordelia! Remember? The, the 'We Hate Cordelia' club, of which you are the treasurer.
xander_harris Look, I was gonna tell you.
willow_rosenberg Gee, what stopped you? Could it be shame?
xander_harris All right, let's overreact, shall we?
willow_rosenberg But I'm...
xander_harris Willow, we were just kissing. It doesn't mean that much.
willow_rosenberg No. It just means that you'd rather be with someone you hate than be with me.
buffy_summers Angel!
angel Hey!
buffy_summers Oh!
angel Hey.
buffy_summers Oh, my God! I was so worried!
angel I didn't mean to frighten you.
buffy_summers Where did you go?
angel Been around.
buffy_summers Ohhh. Oh, my God! I was freaking out! You just disappeared.
angel What? I took off.
buffy_summers But you didn't say anything. You just left.
angel Yeah. Like I really wanted to stick around after that.
buffy_summers What?
angel You got a lot to learn about men, kiddo. Although I guess you proved that last night.
buffy_summers What are you saying?
angel Let's not make an issue out of it, okay? In fact, let's not talk about it at all. It happened.
buffy_summers I, I don't understand. Was it m-me? Was I not good?
angel You were great. Really. I thought you were a pro.
buffy_summers How can you say this to me?
angel Lighten up. It was a good time. It doesn't mean like we have to make a big deal.
buffy_summers It *is* a big deal!
angel It's what? Bells ringing, fireworks, a dulcet choir of pretty little birdies? Come on, Buffy. It's not like I've never been there before.
buffy_summers Don't touch me.
angel I should've known you wouldn't be able to handle it.
buffy_summers Angel! I love you.
angel Love you, too. I'll call you.
uncle_enyos You know what it is, this thing vengeance?
jenny_calendar Uncle, I have served you. I have been faithful. I need to know...
uncle_enyos To the modern man vengeance is a verb, an idea. Payback. One thing for another. Like commerce. Not with us. Vengeance is a living thing. It passes through generations. It commands. It kills.
jenny_calendar You told me to watch Angel. You told me to keep him from the Slayer. I tried. But there are other factors. There are terrible things happening here that we cannot control.
uncle_enyos We control nothing. We are not wizards, Janna. We merely play our part.
jenny_calendar Angel could be of help to us. I mean, he may be the only chance we have to stop the Judge.
uncle_enyos It is too late for that.
jenny_calendar Why?
uncle_enyos The curse. Angel is meant to suffer, not to live as human. One moment of true happiness, of contentment, one moment where the soul that we restored no longer plagues his thoughts, and that soul is taken from him.
jenny_calendar Then, if somehow, if... if it's happened... then Angelus is back.
uncle_enyos I hoped to stop it. But I realize now it was arranged to be so.
jenny_calendar Buffy loves him.
uncle_enyos And now she will have to kill him.
jenny_calendar Unless he kills her first! Uncle, this is insanity! People are going to die.
uncle_enyos Yes. It is not justice we serve. It is vengeance.
jenny_calendar You are a fool. We're all fools.
xander_harris Will.
willow_rosenberg Hey.
xander_harris Where'd you go?
willow_rosenberg Home.
xander_harris I'm glad you came back. We can't do this without you.
willow_rosenberg Let's get this straight. I don't understand it, I don't wanna understand it, you have gross emotional problems, and things are not okay between us. But what's happening right now is more important than that.
xander_harris Okay.
willow_rosenberg What about the Judge? Where do we stand?
xander_harris On a pile of really boring books that say exactly the same thing.
willow_rosenberg Lemme guess: 'no weapon forged.'
xander_harris 'It took an army.'
willow_rosenberg Yeah, where's an army when you need one? What?
xander_harris Whoa. Whoa! I... I think I'm having a thought. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a thought. Now I'm having a plan.
xander_harris Now I'm having a wiggins.
willow_rosenberg What's going on?
xander_harris Let's get to the library.
angel Willow. Xander.
xander_harris Angel.
willow_rosenberg Thank God you're okay. Did you see Buffy?
angel Yeah. What's up with the lights?
xander_harris I don't know. Listen, I think I have an idea.
angel Forget about that now. I... I got something to show you.
willow_rosenberg Show us?
angel Yeah. Xander, go get the others.
xander_harris Okay.
angel And Willow. Come here.
willow_rosenberg What is it, Angel?
angel It's amazing.
jenny_calendar Willow, get away from him.
willow_rosenberg What?
jenny_calendar Walk to me.
willow_rosenberg What are you talking about? It's Ang...
xander_harris Don't do that!
angel Oh, I think I do that.
willow_rosenberg Angel...
jenny_calendar He's not Angel anymore. Are you?
angel Wrong. I *am* Angel. At last!
xander_harris Oh, my God.
angel I got a message for Buffy.
buffy_summers Why don't you give it to me yourself?
angel Well, it's not really the kind of message you tell. It sort of involves finding the bodies of all your friends.
buffy_summers This can't be you.
angel Gee, we already covered that subject.
buffy_summers Angel, there must be some part of you inside that still remembers who you are.
angel Dream on, schoolgirl.
angel Your boyfriend is dead. You're all gonna join him.
buffy_summers Leave Willow alone, and deal with me.
angel But she's so cute and helpless. Really a turn-on.
angel Things are about to get *very* interesting.
xander_harris Buffy, you okay?
xander_harris Buffy.
rupert_giles And we're absolutely certain that, that Angel has reverted to his former self?
xander_harris Yeah, uh, we're all certain. Anyone not feeling certain here?
willow_rosenberg Giles, you wouldn't have believed him. He was so... He came here to kill us.
cordelia_chase What are we gonna do?
rupert_giles I'm leaning towards blind panic myself.
jenny_calendar Rupert, don't talk like that. The kids.
rupert_giles I'm sorry. It's just that things are bad enough with the Judge here. Angel crossing over to the other side... I-I-I wasn't prepared for that.
jenny_calendar None of us were.
willow_rosenberg Are you okay?
willow_rosenberg Is there anything I can do?
buffy_summers I should've known. When I saw him at the house, he was different. The things he said...
rupert_giles What things?
buffy_summers It's private.
jenny_calendar But you didn't know he had turned bad?
willow_rosenberg How did you?
jenny_calendar What?
willow_rosenberg Well, you knew. You told me to get away from him.
jenny_calendar Well, I saw his face.
rupert_giles If only we knew how it happened.
buffy_summers What do you mean?
rupert_giles Well, something set it off. Some, some, uh, event must've triggered his transformation. Well, if anyone would know, Buffy, it-it should be you.
buffy_summers I don't.
rupert_giles Well, did anything happen last night that, that might...
buffy_summers Giles, please, I can't.
rupert_giles Buffy, I'm sorry, but we can't afford to... Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Giles, shut up.
cordelia_chase This is great. There's an unkillable demon in town, Angel's joined his team, the Slayer is a basket case... I'd say we've hit bottom.
xander_harris I have a plan.
cordelia_chase Oh, no, here's a lower place.
xander_harris I don't know what's up with Angel, but I think I may have a way to deal with this Judge guy.
willow_rosenberg What do we do?
xander_harris I think, um... I think I may need Cordelia for this one.
xander_harris And we may need wheels.
cordelia_chase Well, my car is...
xander_harris It might have to be bigger.
willow_rosenberg No problem. I'll get Oz. He has a van.
xander_harris Good. Okay.
cordelia_chase Care to let me in on the plan I'm a part of?
xander_harris No.
cordelia_chase Why not?
xander_harris Because if I tell you, then you won't do it. Just meet me at Willow's house in half an hour. And wear something trashy... ...er.
rupert_giles I'm not sure what we should do about Buffy.
jenny_calendar Assuming they don't attack tonight I think we should just let her be.
willow_rosenberg I agree.
rupert_giles I-I-I can imagine what she's going through.
willow_rosenberg No, I don't think you can.
angel You should've seen her face. It was priceless. I'll never forget it.
spike So you didn't kill her then.
angel Of course not.
spike Now, I know you haven't been in the game for a while, mate, but we still do kill people. Sort of our raison d'etre, you know.
drusilla You don't want to kill her, do you? You want to hurt her. Just like you hurt me.
angel Nobody knows me like you do, Dru.
spike She'd better not get in our way.
angel Don't worry about it.
spike I do.
angel Spike, my boy, you *really* don't get it! Do you? You tried to kill her, but you couldn't. Look at you. You're a wreck! She's stronger than any Slayer you've ever faced. Force won't get it done. You gotta work from the inside. To kill this girl... you have to love her.
angel I love you.
angel You have to know what to see.
rupert_giles Oh, Buffy.
rupert_giles Buffy!
buffy_summers What do you know?!
student Should I get the principal?
rupert_giles No, I-I-I'll deal with this. Y-y-you're, you're all dismissed!
buffy_summers Did you do it? Did you change him?
rupert_giles For God's sake, calm down!
buffy_summers Did you know this was gonna happen?
rupert_giles You can't go around accusing everybody...
jenny_calendar I didn't know... exactly. I was told... Oh, God. I was sent here to watch you. They told me to keep you and Angel apart. They never told me what would happen.
rupert_giles Jenny!
jenny_calendar I'm sorry, Rupert. Angel was supposed to pay for what he did to my people.
buffy_summers And me? What was I supposed to be paying for?
jenny_calendar I didn't know what would happen until after. I swear I would've told you.
buffy_summers So it was me. I did it.
jenny_calendar I think so. I mean, if you...
rupert_giles I don't understand.
jenny_calendar The curse. If Angel achieved true happiness, even just a moment of... He would lose his soul.
rupert_giles W-w-w-h-h-how do you know you were responsible f-for...
rupert_giles Oh.
jenny_calendar If there is anything that...
buffy_summers Curse him again.
jenny_calendar No, I-I can't. I mean, those magicks are long lost even to my people.
buffy_summers You did it once. It might not be too late to save him.
jenny_calendar It can't be done. I can't help you.
buffy_summers Then take me to someone who can.
uncle_enyos I knew she would bring you. I suppose you want answers.
angel Not really.
angel But thanks for the offer.
Sergeant#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 Right face, hu! Double-time, hu! Left, left, left, left...
xander_harris Wait here. When you guys see that window open get out the ladder, come up, we'll pass you the package, okay?
oz Okay.
willow_rosenberg Be careful.
xander_harris The security here really is a joke. I should, uh, report it.
cordelia_chase Who am I supposed to be again?
xander_harris You're supposed to be a girl. Think you can handle it?
soldier Halt! Identify yourself right the hell now.
xander_harris Uh... Private Harris with the, uh... 33rd.
soldier 33rd are on maneuvers.
xander_harris Right! Uh, I'm on leave. From them.
soldier You always spend your leave snooping around the armory, pal? And who is she?
cordelia_chase Hi. I'm not a soldier. Right?
xander_harris Look, I... I just want to give her the tour. Uh, you know what I'm saying.
soldier The tour.
xander_harris Well, you know the ladies. They like to see the big guns. Gets them all hot and bothered. Can you cut me some slack, gimme a blind eye?
soldier And why should I?
xander_harris Well, if you do, I won't tell Colonel Newsome that your boots ain't regulation, your post wasn't covered, and you hold your gun like a sissy girl.
soldier You got 20 minutes, nimrod.
xander_harris I just need 5. Uh, forget I said that last part.
cordelia_chase Okay, what was that? And who are you?
xander_harris Remember Halloween, I got turned into a soldier?
cordelia_chase Yeah.
xander_harris Well, I still remember all of it. I know procedure, ordnance, access codes, everything. I know the whole layout for this base, and I'm pretty sure I can put together an M-16 in 57 seconds.
cordelia_chase Well, I'm sort of impressed. But let's just find the thing and get out of here.
xander_harris Okay.
cordelia_chase So, does looking at guns really make girls wanna have sex? That's scary.
xander_harris Yeah, I guess.
cordelia_chase Well, does looking at guns make you wanna have sex?
xander_harris I'm seventeen. Looking at linoleum makes me wanna have sex.
willow_rosenberg I wish they'd hurry.
oz So, do you guys steal weapons from the Army a lot?
willow_rosenberg Well, we don't have cable, so we have to make our own fun.
oz I get you.
willow_rosenberg Do you wanna make out with me?
oz What?
willow_rosenberg Forget it. I'm sorry. Well, do you?
oz Sometimes when I'm sitting in class... You know, I'm not thinking about class, 'cause that would never happen. I think about kissing you. And it's like everything stops. It's like, it's like freeze frame. Willow kissage.
oz Oh, I'm not gonna kiss you.
willow_rosenberg What? But freeze frame!
oz Well, to the casual observer, it would appear that you're trying to make your friend Xander jealous or even the score or something. And that's on the empty side. See, in my fantasy when I'm kissing *you*, you're kissing *me*. It's okay. I can wait. We're up.
jenny_calendar Oh, my God.
rupert_giles He's doing this deliberately, Buffy. He's trying to make it harder for you.
buffy_summers He's only making it easier. I know what I have to do.
rupert_giles What?
buffy_summers Kill him.
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 I am ready.
spike About time.
spike Have fun.
angel Too bad you can't come with, huh? I'll be thinkin' of you.
spike I won't be in this chair forever.
spike What happens if your girlfriend shows up?
angel I'm gonna give her a kiss. Don't you look spiffy!
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 Spiffy?
xander_harris Happy Birthday, Buffy. I hope you like the color.
buffy_summers Giles, we go to the factory first, but they might not be there. They're on the offensive. We need to figure out where they'd go.
rupert_giles Agreed.
buffy_summers This is good.
jenny_calendar Do you, uh... Is there something I can do?
buffy_summers Get out.
jenny_calendar I-I just want to help.
rupert_giles She just said get out.
xander_harris Do you want me to show you how to use it?
buffy_summers Yes, I do.
buffy_summers I knew it.
rupert_giles We haven't a bead on where they would go?
buffy_summers I don't know, uh... somewhere crowded, I guess. I mean, the Judge needs bodies, right?
willow_rosenberg The Bronze?
xander_harris It's closed tonight.
cordelia_chase There's not a lot of choices in Sunnydale. It's not like people are gonna line up to get massacred.
oz Uh, guys? If I were gonna line up, I know where I'd go.
angel Lock the exits, boys.
angel It's all yours.
buffy_summers Everybody keep back. Damage control only. Take out any lesser vamps if you can. I'll handle the Smurf.
drusilla Oh, goody!
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 Who dares?
buffy_summers Think I got his attention.
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 You're a fool. No weapon forged can stop me.
buffy_summers That was then.
buffy_summers This is now.
Judge#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season02.Episode14 What's that do?
buffy_summers Best present ever.
xander_harris Knew you'd like it.
willow_rosenberg Do you think he's dead?
buffy_summers We can't be sure. Pick up the pieces and keep them separate.
cordelia_chase Pieces? We get the pieces. Our job sucks!
angel You know what the worst part was, huh? Pretending that I loved you. If I'd known how easily you'd give it up, I wouldn't have even bothered.
buffy_summers That doesn't work anymore. You're not Angel.
angel You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? It doesn't matter. The important thing is you made me the man I am today!
oz Uh... Arm.
angel Not quittin' on me already, are ya? Come on, Buffy. You know you want it, huh?
angel You can't do it. You can't kill me.
buffy_summers Give me time.
rupert_giles It's not over. I-I-I suppose you know that. He'll come after you, particularly. His profile, uh, well, he... he's likely to strike out at the things that made him the most human.
buffy_summers You must be so disappointed in me.
rupert_giles No. No, no, I'm not.
buffy_summers But this is all my fault.
rupert_giles No. I don't believe it is. Do you want me to wag my finger at you and tell you that you acted rashly? You did. A-and I can. I know that you loved him. And... he... has proven more than once that he loved you. You couldn't have known what would happen. The coming months a-are gonna, are gonna be hard... I, I suspect on all of us, but... if it's guilt you're looking for, Buffy, I'm, I'm not your man. All you will get from me is, is my support. And my respect.
joyce_summers Did I miss anything?
buffy_summers Um... just some singing and some running around.
joyce_summers Mm. I'm sorry I didn't have time to make you a real cake.
buffy_summers No. This is good.
joyce_summers But we're still going shopping on Saturday. So what'd you do for your birthday? Did you have fun?
buffy_summers I got older.
joyce_summers You look the same to me.
joyce_summers Happy Birthday. I don't have to sing, do I?
buffy_summers No.
joyce_summers Well, go on, make a wish.
buffy_summers I'll just let it burn.
