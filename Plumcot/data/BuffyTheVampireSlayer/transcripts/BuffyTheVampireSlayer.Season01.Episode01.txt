darla Are you sure this is a good idea?
boy It's a great idea, now come on.
darla Do you go to school here?
boy I used to. On top of the gym it's so cool. You can see the whole town.
darla I, I, I, I don't wanna go up there.
boy Aw, you can't wait, huh?
darla We're just gonna get in trouble.
boy Yeah, you can count on it.
darla What was that?
boy What was what?
darla I heard a noise.
boy It's nothing!
darla Uh, uh, maybe it's something.
boy Or maybe it's some *thing*!
darla That's not funny.
boy Hellooooo! There's nobody here.
darla Are you sure?
boy Yes, I'm sure.
darla Okay.
werewolf Howl.
joyce_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers I'm up, Mom!
joyce_summers Don't wanna be late for your first day!
buffy_summers No... Wouldn't want that.
joyce_summers Okay!
joyce_summers Have a good time. I know you're gonna make friends right away, just think positive.
joyce_summers And honey?
joyce_summers Try not to get kicked out?
buffy_summers I promise.
joyce_summers Okay.
xander_harris 'Scuse me, comin' through, pardon me, 'scuse me, whoa! 'Scuse me, not sure how to stop! Please move, whoa, 'scuse me... Whoa.
xander_harris God!
xander_harris I'm Okay. I feel good.
xander_harris Willow! You're so very much the person that I wanted to see!
willow_rosenberg Oh, really?
xander_harris Yeah. You know, I kinda had a problem with the math.
willow_rosenberg Uh, which part?
xander_harris The math. Can you help me out tonight, pleeeease, be my study buddy?
willow_rosenberg Well, what's in it for me?
xander_harris A shiny nickel!
willow_rosenberg Okay. Do you have 'Theories in Trig'? You should check it out.
xander_harris Check it out?
willow_rosenberg From the library? Where the books live.
xander_harris Right, I'm there! See, I wanna change...
jesse Hey, hey!
xander_harris Hey, Jesse, what's what?
jesse New Girl!
xander_harris That's right, I saw her. Pretty much a hottie!
willow_rosenberg I heard someone was transferring...
xander_harris So tell!
jesse Tell what?
xander_harris What's the sitch, what do ya know about her?
jesse New girl!
xander_harris Well, you're certainly a font of nothing!
principal_bob_flutie Buffy Summers, sophomore, late of Hemery High in Los Angeles. Interesting record, quite a career...
principal_bob_flutie Welcome to Sunnydale! A clean slate, Buffy, that's what you get here. What's past is past. We're not interested in what it says on a piece of paper, even if it says... Whoa.
buffy_summers Mr. Flutie
principal_bob_flutie All the kids here are free to call me Bob.
buffy_summers Bob
principal_bob_flutie But they don't.
buffy_summers I know my transcripts are a little... colorful.
principal_bob_flutie Heeey... We're not caring about that. Do you think, uh, 'colorful' is the word? Not, uh, 'dismal'?
buffy_summers Wasn't *that* bad!
principal_bob_flutie You burned down the gym.
buffy_summers I did, I really did, but... You're not seeing the big picture here, I mean, that gym was full of vampiasbestos.
principal_bob_flutie Buffy, don't worry. Any other school they might say 'watch your step', or 'we'll be watching you'... But, that's just not the way *here*. We want to service your needs, and help you to respect our needs. And if your needs and our needs don't mesh...
buffy_summers Oh! Sorry!
girl_2 That's okay.
buffy_summers Oh...
xander_harris Can I have you?
xander_harris Duh... Can I help you?
buffy_summers Thanks.
xander_harris I don't know you, do I?
buffy_summers I'm Buffy. I'm new.
xander_harris Xander. Is-is me. Hi.
buffy_summers Um, thanks.
xander_harris Well, uh, maybe I'll see you around... maybe at school... since we... both... go there.
buffy_summers Great! It was nice to meet you.
xander_harris We both go to school. Very suave. Very not pathetic.
xander_harris Oh, hey! Hey, you forgot your... stake.
teacher It's estimated that about twenty-five million people died in that one four-year span. But the fun part of the Black Plague is that it originated in Europe how?
teacher As an early form of germ warfare. If you'll look at the map on page sixty-three you can trace the spread of the disease into Rome, and then north...
buffy_summers Thanks.
teacher And this popular plague led to what social changes? Steve?
cordelia_chase Hi! I'm Cordelia.
buffy_summers I'm Buffy.
cordelia_chase If you're looking for a textbook of your very own there's probably a few in the library.
buffy_summers Oh, great, thanks. Where would that be?
cordelia_chase I'll show you, come on. So you're from Hemery, right? In L.A.?
buffy_summers Uh, yeah.
cordelia_chase Oh, I would *kill* to live in L.A. That close to that many shoes?
cordelia_chase Well, you'll be okay here. If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time. Of course, we do have to test your coolness factor. You're from L.A., so you can skip the written, but let's see. Vamp nail polish?
buffy_summers Um, over?
cordelia_chase So over. James Spader?
buffy_summers He needs to call me!
cordelia_chase Frappaccinos?
buffy_summers Trendy, but tasty.
cordelia_chase John Tesh?
buffy_summers The Devil.
cordelia_chase That was pretty much a gimme, but... you passed!
buffy_summers Oh, goody!
cordelia_chase Willow! Nice dress! Good to know you've seen the softer side of Sears.
willow_rosenberg Uh, oh, well, my mom picked it out.
cordelia_chase No wonder you're such a guy magnet. Are you done?
willow_rosenberg Oh!
cordelia_chase You wanna fit in here, the first rule is: know your losers. Once you can identify them all by sight they're a lot easier to avoid.
cordelia_chase And if you're not too swamped with catching up you should come by the Bronze tonight.
buffy_summers The who?
cordelia_chase The Bronze. It's the only club worth going to around here. They let anybody in, but it's still the scene. It's in the bad part of town.
buffy_summers Where's that?
cordelia_chase About a half a block from the good part of town. We don't have a whole lot of town here. But, um, you should show!
buffy_summers Well, I'll try. Uh, thanks.
cordelia_chase Good. So, um, I'll see you in gym, and you can tell me absolutely everything there is to know about you.
buffy_summers Great! Oh, that sounds like fun.
buffy_summers Hello? Is anybody here?
buffy_summers Ooh! Anybody's here!
rupert_giles Can I help you?
buffy_summers I was looking for some, well, books. I'm new.
rupert_giles Miss Summers?
buffy_summers Good call! Guess I'm the only new kid, huh?
rupert_giles I'm Mr. Giles. The librarian. I was told you were coming.
buffy_summers Great! So, um, I'm gonna need 'Perspectives on 20th Century'
rupert_giles I know what you're after!
buffy_summers That's not what I'm looking for.
rupert_giles Are you sure?
buffy_summers I'm *way* sure.
rupert_giles My mistake.
rupert_giles So, what is it you said
aphrodesia The new kid? She seems kind of weird to me. What kind of name is Buffy?
girl_2 Hey, Aphrodisia!
aphrodesia Oh, Hey!
aura Well, the chatter in the caf is that she got kicked out, and that's why her mom had to get a new job.
aphrodesia Neg!
aura Pos! She was starting fights!
aphrodesia Neg-ly!
aura Well I heard from Blue, and she said that
buffy_summers Uh, Hi! Willow, right?
willow_rosenberg Why? I-I mean, hi! Uh, did you want me to move?
buffy_summers Why don't we start with, 'Hi, I'm Buffy,' and, uh, then let's segue directly into me asking you for a favor. It doesn't involve moving, but it does involve hanging out with me for a while.
willow_rosenberg But aren't you hanging out with Cordelia?
buffy_summers I can't do both?
willow_rosenberg Not legally.
buffy_summers Look, I really wanna get by herenew schooland... Cordelia's been really nice... to me... anyway, but, um, I kinda have this burning desire not to flunk all my classes, and I heard a rumor that you were the person to talk to if I wanted to get caught up.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I could *totally* help you out! Uh, if you have sixth period free we could meet in the library?
buffy_summers Or not. Or we could meet someplace quieter. Louder. Uh, that place just kinda gives me the wiggins.
willow_rosenberg Oh, it has that effect on most kids. I love it, though, it's a great collection, and the new librarian is really cool.
buffy_summers He's new?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, he just started. He was a curator at some British museum, or, or *The* British Museum, I'm not sure. But he knows everything, and he brought all these historical volumes and biographies, and am I the single dullest person alive?
buffy_summers Not at all.
jesse Hey!
xander_harris You guys busy? Are we interrupting? We're interrupting.
buffy_summers Hey!
willow_rosenberg Hey!
jesse Hey there!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, this is Jesse and that's Xander.
xander_harris Oh, me and Buffy go waaay back, old friends, very close. Then there's that period of estrangement where I think we were both growing as people, but now here we are, like old times, I'm quite moved.
jesse Is it me, or are you turning into a bibbling idiot?
xander_harris No, it's, uh, it's not you.
buffy_summers Well, it's nice to meet you guys, I think.
jesse Well, you know, we wanted to welcome ya, make ya feel at home, unless you have a scary home...
xander_harris And to return this. The only thing I can think is that you're building a really little fence.
buffy_summers Hah, no, um, a-a-actually it was for self-defense. Everyone has them in L.A. Pepper spray is just so pass√©.
xander_harris So what do you do for fun, what do you like, what do you look for in a man, let's hear it.
jesse If you have any dark, painful secrets you'd like us to publish?
buffy_summers Gee, everyone wants to know about me. How keen.
xander_harris Well, not much goes on in a one Starbucks town like Sunnydale. You're pretty big news.
buffy_summers I'm not. Really.
cordelia_chase Are these guys bothering you?
buffy_summers Uh, no!
willow_rosenberg She's not hanging out with us.
jesse Hey! Cordelia!
cordelia_chase Oh, please! I don't mean to interrupt your downward mobility, but I just wanted to tell you that you won't be meeting Coach Foster, the woman with the chest hair, because gym was canceled due to the *extreme* dead guy in the locker.
buffy_summers What?
willow_rosenberg What are you talking about?
cordelia_chase Some guy was stuffed in Aura's locker!
buffy_summers Dead.
cordelia_chase Totally dead. Way dead.
xander_harris It's not just a little dead, then?
cordelia_chase Don't you have an elsewhere to be?
jesse Y'know, if you need a shoulder to cry on, or just to nibble on...
buffy_summers How did he die?
cordelia_chase I don't know.
buffy_summers Well, were there any marks?
cordelia_chase Morbid much! I didn't ask!
buffy_summers Um, I gotta book. I'll, I'll see you guys later.
cordelia_chase What's her deal?
buffy_summers Oh, great.
buffy_summers Okay, what's the sitch?
rupert_giles Sorry?
buffy_summers You heard about the dead guy, right? The dead guy in the locker?
rupert_giles Yes.
buffy_summers 'Cause, it's the weirdest thing. He's got two little, little holes in his neck, and all his blood's been drained. Isn't that bizarre? Aren't you just going, 'ooh'?
rupert_giles I was afraid of this.
buffy_summers Well, *I* wasn't! It's my first day! I was afraid that I was gonna be behind in all my classes, that I wouldn't make any friends, that I would have last month's hair. I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus. And I don't care.
rupert_giles Then why are you here?
buffy_summers To tell you that... I don't care, which... I don't, and... have now told you, so... bye.
rupert_giles Is he, w-will he... rise again?
buffy_summers Who?
rupert_giles The boy.
buffy_summers No. He's just dead.
rupert_giles Can you be sure?
buffy_summers To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood. And then you have to suck their blood. It's like a whole big sucking thing. Mostly they're just gonna kill you. Why am I still talking to you?
rupert_giles You really have no idea what's going on, do you? You think it's coincidence, your being here? That boy was just the beginning.
buffy_summers Oh, why can't you people just leave me alone?
rupert_giles Because you are the Slayer. Into each generation a Slayer is born, one girl in all the world, a Chosen One, one born with the strength and skill to hunt
buffy_summers With the strength and skill to hunt the vampires, to stop the spread of their evil blah, blah, blah... I've heard it, okay?
rupert_giles I really don't understand this attitude. You, you've accepted your duty, you, you've slain vampires before...
buffy_summers Yeah, and I've both been there and done that, and I'm moving on.
rupert_giles What do you know about this town?
buffy_summers It's two hours on the freeway from Neiman Marcus?
rupert_giles Dig a bit in the history of this place. You'll find a, a steady stream of fairly odd occurrences. Now, I believe this whole area is a center of mystical energy, that things gravitate towards it that, that, that you might not find elsewhere.
buffy_summers Like vampires.
rupert_giles Like zombies, werewolves, incubi, succubi, everything you've ever dreaded was under your bed, but told yourself couldn't be by the light of day. They're all real!
buffy_summers What? You, like, sent away for the Time-Life series?
rupert_giles Ah, w-w-w-yes.
buffy_summers Did you get the free phone?
rupert_giles Um, the calendar.
buffy_summers Cool! But, okay, first of all, I'm a Vampire Slayer. And secondly, I'm retired. Hey, I know! Why don't you kill 'em?
rupert_giles I-I'm a Watcher, I-I haven't the skill...
buffy_summers Oh, come on, stake through the heart, a little sunlight... It's like falling off a log.
rupert_giles A, a Slayer slays, a Watcher
buffy_summers Watches?
rupert_giles Yes. No! He, he trains her, he, he, he prepares her
buffy_summers Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out of school? For losing all of my friends? For having to spend all of my time fighting for my life and never getting to tell anyone because I might endanger them? Go ahead! Prepare me.
rupert_giles Damn!
xander_harris What?
rupert_giles It's getting worse!
buffy_summers What's getting worse?
rupert_giles The influx of the undead, the... supernatural occurrences, it's been building for years. There's a reason why you're here and a reason why it's now!
buffy_summers Because now is the time my mom moved here.
rupert_giles Something's coming, something, something... something is, is gonna happen here. Soon!
buffy_summers Gee, can you vague that up for me?
rupert_giles The signs, as far as I can tell, point to a crucial mystical upheaval, very soon. Days. Possibly less.
buffy_summers Oh, come on! This is Sunnydale! How bad an evil can there be here?
luke The sleeper will wake. The sleeper will wake. The sleeper will wake. The sleeper will wake, and the world will bleed. Amen!
buffy_summers Hi! I'm an enormous slut! Hello! Would you like a copy of 'The Watchtower'? I used to be so good at this.
joyce_summers Hi, hon.
buffy_summers Hey!
joyce_summers Are you, uh, going out tonight?
buffy_summers Yeah, I'm going to a club.
joyce_summers Oh. Will there be boys there?
buffy_summers No, Mom. It's a nun club.
joyce_summers Well, just be careful.
buffy_summers I will.
joyce_summers You know, I think we can make it work here. I've got my positive energy flowing... I'm gonna get the Gallery on its feet... Oh, uh, we may have found a space today.
buffy_summers That's great.
joyce_summers Oh, and that school is a, a very nurturing environment, which is just what you need.
buffy_summers Well, actually...
joyce_summers Oh, not too nurturing. I know, you're sixteen, I've read all about the dangers of over-nurturing.
joyce_summers It's hard. New town and everything... It is for me, too. I'm trying to make it work. I'm *going* to make it work.
buffy_summers I know.
joyce_summers Oh, you're a good girl, Buffy, you just fell in with the wrong crowd. But that is all behind us now.
buffy_summers It is. From now on I am only going to hang out with the living. I mean, lively. People.
joyce_summers Hmm. Okay. You have fun.
angel Ah, heh. Is there a problem, ma'am?
buffy_summers Yeah, there's a problem. Why are you following me?
angel I know what you're thinking. Don't worry, I don't bite.
angel Truth is, I thought you'd be taller, or bigger muscles and all that. You're pretty spry, though.
buffy_summers What do you want?
angel The same thing you do.
buffy_summers Okay. What do I want?
angel To kill them. To kill them all.
buffy_summers Sorry, that's incorrect. But you do get this lovely watch and a year's supply of Turtle Wax. What I *want* is to be left alone!
angel Do you really think that's an option anymore? You're standing at the Mouth of Hell. And it's about to open.
angel Don't turn your back on this. You've gotta be ready.
buffy_summers What for?
angel For the Harvest.
buffy_summers Who are you?
angel Let's just say... I'm a friend.
buffy_summers Yeah, well, maybe I don't want a friend.
angel I didn't say I was yours.
buffy_summers Hey!
willow_rosenberg Oh, hi!
willow_rosenberg Hi!
buffy_summers Oh, you're here with someone?
willow_rosenberg No, I'm just here. I thought Xander was gonna show up.
buffy_summers Oh, are you guys going out?
willow_rosenberg No, we're just friends. We used to go out, but we broke up.
buffy_summers How come?
willow_rosenberg He stole my Barbie. Oh, we were five.
buffy_summers Oh.
willow_rosenberg I-I-I don't actually date a whole lot... lately.
buffy_summers Why not?
willow_rosenberg Well, when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool, or, or witty, or at all. I-I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away.
buffy_summers It's not *that* bad!
willow_rosenberg No, i-it is. I think boys are more interested in a girl who can talk.
buffy_summers You really *haven't* been dating lately.
willow_rosenberg It's probably easy for you.
buffy_summers Yeah, real easy.
willow_rosenberg I-I mean you don't seem too shy.
buffy_summers Well, my philosophy, do you wanna hear my philosophy?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, I do!
buffy_summers Life is short.
willow_rosenberg Life is short!
buffy_summers Not original, I'll grant you, but it's true. You know? Why waste time being all shy and worrying about some guy, and if he's gonna laugh at you. Seize the moment, 'cause tomorrow you might be dead.
willow_rosenberg Oh, that's nice!
buffy_summers Um, I'll be back in a minute.
willow_rosenberg Oh, tha-that's okay, you don't have to come back.
buffy_summers I'll be back in a minute.
willow_rosenberg Seize the moment.
buffy_summers So, you like to party with the students. Isn't that kinda skanky?
rupert_giles Oh, right, this is me having fun. Watching... clown hair prance about is hardly my idea of a party. I'd much rather be at home with a cup of Bovril and a good book.
buffy_summers You need a personality, stat!
rupert_giles This is a perfect breeding ground for vampire activity. It's dark, it's crowded... Besides, I knew you were likely to show up, and I have to make you understand
buffy_summers That the Harvest is coming. I know, your friend told me.
rupert_giles What did you say?
buffy_summers The Harvest. That mean something to you? 'Cause I'm drawing a blank.
rupert_giles I'm not sure. Uh... W-who told you this?
buffy_summers This... guy. Dark, gorgeous in an annoying sort of way. I figured you two were buds.
rupert_giles No. The Harvest. Did he say anything else?
buffy_summers Something about the Mouth of Hell. I *really* didn't like him!
rupert_giles Look at them, throwing themselves about, completely unaware of the danger that surrounds them.
buffy_summers Lucky them.
rupert_giles Or perhaps you're right. Perhaps there is no trouble coming; the signs could be wrong. It's not as though you've been having the nightmares.
cordelia_chase My mom doesn't even *get* out of bed anymore. And the doctor says it's Epstein-Barr. I'm like, pleeease! It's chronic hepatitis, or at least chronic fatigue syndrome. I mean, *nobody* cool has Epstein-Barr anymore.
jesse Hey, Cordelia!
cordelia_chase Oh, yay, it's my stalker.
jesse Hey, you, uh, you look great!
cordelia_chase Well, I'm glad we had this little chat.
jesse Listen, uh, you know, you wanna dance, you know?
cordelia_chase With you?
jesse Well, uh, yeah.
cordelia_chase Well, uh, no! C'mon, guys.
jesse Fine! Plenty of other fish in the sea. Oh, yeah, I'm... on the prowl. Witness me prowling!
buffy_summers I didn't say I'd never slay another vampire. It's not like I have all these fluffy-bunny feelings for them, I'm just not gonna get way extracurricular with it. You know, if I see one, sure I'll
rupert_giles Will you be ready? There's so much you don't know about them, about your own powers. A vampire appears to be completely normal until the feed is upon them, only then do they reveal their true demonic visage.
buffy_summers You're like a textbook with arms, I know this.
rupert_giles The point is, a Slayer should be able to see them anyway. Without looking, without thinking. Can you tell me if there's a vampire in this building?
buffy_summers Maybe...
rupert_giles You should know. Even through this mass and this... din, you should be able to sense them. Well, try! Reach out with your mind. You have to hone your senses, focus until the energy washes over you, until you, you feel every particle of-of
buffy_summers There's one.
rupert_giles W-where?
buffy_summers Right there, talking to that girl.
rupert_giles You don't know
buffy_summers Oh, please! Look at his jacket. He's got the sleeves rolled up, and the shirt! Deal with that outfit for a moment.
rupert_giles It's dated?
buffy_summers It's carbon dated. Trust me, only someone living underground for ten years would think that was still the look.
rupert_giles But you didn't... hone.
buffy_summers Oh, no.
rupert_giles Isn't that
buffy_summers Willow.
rupert_giles What's she doing?
buffy_summers Seizing the moment!
buffy_summers Cordelia!
cordelia_chase God! What is your childhood trauma?!
buffy_summers Have you guys seen Willow? Did she come by here?
cordelia_chase Why? Do you need to attack her with the stick? Jeez!
cordelia_chase Excuse me, I have to call *everyone* I have *ever* met, right now.
rupert_giles That *was* quick. Well done! I-I need to go to the library. This Harvest thing...
buffy_summers I didn't find them!
rupert_giles The vampire is not dead?
buffy_summers No, but my social life is on the critical list.
rupert_giles So, what do we do?
buffy_summers I'll take care of it!
rupert_giles I-I-I need to come with you, yes?
buffy_summers Don't worry. One vampire I can handle.
jesse So, um, what did you say your name was?
darla Darla.
jesse Darla. You know, I haven't seen you around before. Are you from around here?
darla No, but I have family here.
jesse Have I met them?
darla You probably will.
luke Master!
the_master I am weak.
luke 'In the Harvest, he will be restored.'
the_master The Harvest.
luke We're almost there. Soon you'll be free!
the_master I must be ready. I need my strength.
luke I've sent your servants to bring you some food.
the_master Good. Luke?
luke Yes?
the_master Bring me something... young.
willow_rosenberg Sure is dark.
thomas It's night.
willow_rosenberg Well, that's a dark time, night. Traditionally. I still can't believe I've never seen you at school. Do you have Mr. Chomsky for history?
willow_rosenberg Uh, the ice cream bar is this way. It's past Hamilton Street?
thomas I know a shortcut.
xander_harris Hey, you're leaving already?
buffy_summers Oh, Xander! Have you seen Willow?
xander_harris Not tonight, no.
buffy_summers She left with a guy.
xander_harris We're talking about Willow, right? Scorin' at the Bronze, work it girl
buffy_summers No, I need to find her. Where would he take her?
xander_harris Why? Oh, hey, I hope he's not a vampire, because then you might have to slay him.
buffy_summers Was there a-a school bulletin? Was it i-in the newspaper? Is there anyone in this town who doesn't know I'm the Slayer?
xander_harris No. I only know that you *think* that you're the Slayer, and the reason why I know that
buffy_summers Well, whatever, it doesn't matter, just tell me, where would Willow go?
xander_harris You're serious!
buffy_summers We don't find her and there's gonna be one more dead body in the morning!
willow_rosenberg Oh, okay, th-this is nice... and scary. Are you sure this is faster?
thomas Hey! Ever been in one of these?
willow_rosenberg No. Thank you.
thomas Come on. What are you afraid of?
willow_rosenberg That wasn't funny!
willow_rosenberg I think I'm gonna go.
thomas Is that what you think?
darla Is this the best you could do?
thomas She's fresh!
darla Hardly enough to share.
thomas Why didn't you bring your own?
darla I did.
jesse Hey! Wait up!
willow_rosenberg Oh, my God, Jesse!
jesse Y'know, you gave me a hickey.
darla I got hungry on the way.
willow_rosenberg Jesse, let's get outta here!
darla Oh, you're not going anywhere.
willow_rosenberg Leave us alone!
darla You're not going anywhere until we've *fed*!
buffy_summers Well, this is nice. I-it's a little bare, but a dash of paint, a few throw pillows... call it home!
darla Who the hell are you?
buffy_summers You mean there's actually someone in this town who doesn't know already? Whew, that's a relief, I'm telling you! Having a secret identity in this town is a job of work.
xander_harris Buffy, we bail now, right?
thomas Not yet!
buffy_summers Okay, first of all, what's with the outfit? Live in the now, okay? You look like DeBarge!
buffy_summers Now, we can do this the hard way, or... well, actually there's just the hard way.
darla That's fine with me!

buffy_summers Xander, go!
darla Don't go far!

luke 'And like a plague of boils, the race of man covered the Earth.'
luke 'But on the third day of the newest light would come the Harvest. And the blood of men will flow as wine.'
luke 'When the Master will walk among them once more.'

luke 'And Hell itself will come to town.'
luke Amen!
