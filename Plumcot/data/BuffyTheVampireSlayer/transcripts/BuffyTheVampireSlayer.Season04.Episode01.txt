buffy_summers Anything?
willow_rosenberg Ah! 'Introduction to the Modern Novel.' A surveystudy of twentieth century novelists. Open to freshmen, you mightlike that.
buffy_summers 'Introduction to the Modern Novel?' I'm guessing I'd probablyhave to read the modern novel.
willow_rosenberg Maybe more than one.
buffy_summers I like books. I just don't want to take on too much. Do they have an introduction to the modern blurb?
willow_rosenberg Oh! Short story.
buffy_summers Well, that's good.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no. It conflicts with Psych.
buffy_summers Maybe I shouldn't take Psych.
willow_rosenberg You gotta. I-It's fun, a-and you can use it as your sciencerequirement. Anyway, Professor Walsh is supposed to be great. She's like, world-renowned.
buffy_summers How do you get to be renowned? I mean, like, do you haveto be 'nowned' first?
willow_rosenberg Yes, first there's the painful 'nowning' process. Wait! 'Images of Pop Culture.' This is good. T-They watch movies,T-TV shows, even commercials.
buffy_summers For credit?
willow_rosenberg Heh. Isn't college cool?
buffy_summers How'd I miss that one?
willow_rosenberg Well, you did sort of wait till the last minute with your courseselection.
buffy_summers Sorry, 'Miss I-chose-my-major-in-playgroup.'
willow_rosenberg That's an exaggeration. I just, you know, think it'sgood to be prepared. Don't want to be caught unawares.
buffy_summers Well I've been busy! It's been a very slay-heavy summer. I just haven't had a whole lot of time to think about life at UC Sunnydale.
willow_rosenberg It's exciting, though, isn't it?
buffy_summers Yeah! It's gonna be an adjustment.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, it's like, five miles away. It's uncharted territory.
buffy_summers Giles said I have to be secret-identity gal again.
willow_rosenberg That makes sense.
buffy_summers It's gonna be tough, though... with a roommate.
willow_rosenberg Yeah.
buffy_summers I'm psyched about college.
buffy_summers Definitely.
buffy_summers I just need to figure out how it's going to work with my extra-curricularactivities.
buffy_summers I just can't let it take the edge off my slaying.
buffy_summers I gotta stay sharp. Is this guy ever gonna wake up?
student_volunteer FRESHMEN! WE'RE DOING THIS BY FOLDER COLOR! IF YOU'RE NOT HOLDING ON TO A YELLOW FOLDER, YOU'RE IN THE WRONG GROUP.YOU BELONG UP BY WIESMAN HALL.

buffy_summers Yeah, right.
Girl#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
buffy_summers Uh, you know I meant to and then I just got really busy.
Boy#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Party, Thursday at Alpha Delt, you gotta be there. FreeJello shots for freshman women.
buffy_summers Hey, you guys know where Wiesman hall is?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, Hey!
buffy_summers Oh, boy am I glad to see you.
willow_rosenberg Isn't this cool? There's so much going on.
buffy_summers Yeah. Almost, one might say, too much.
willow_rosenberg I got all my courses... except for 'Modern Poetry', I had toswitch to 'Ethno-musicology.' But that's cool, West-African drumming,I think it's going to change everything. Have you met your roommateyet?
buffy_summers No.
willow_rosenberg Me neither. I hope she's cool.
buffy_summers I see you got ticketedtoo.
willow_rosenberg Yes! I've heard about five different issues and I'm angryabout each and every one of them. What'd you get?
buffy_summers 'Jello shots.'
willow_rosenberg I didn't get 'Jello shots!' I-I'll trade you for a-a 'Take Back the Night.'
buffy_summers Are we heading anywhere near Wiesman Hall? I still needto get my I.D. card.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I got mine this morning. The lines are really longnow, you should have gone early.
buffy_summers Well, I hope that I learn from this experience, and that I grow.
willow_rosenberg I'm being annoying, aren't I?
buffy_summers No, it's nice that you're excited.
willow_rosenberg It's just in High School, knowledge was pretty much frownedupon. You really had to work to learn anything. But here, theenergy, the collective intelligence, it's like this force, this penetratingforce, and I can just feel my mind opening upyou know?and letting thisplace thrust into and spurt knowledge into... That sentence endedup in a different place than it started out in.
buffy_summers I'm with you, though, I'm all for spurty knowledge. It'sjust, a little overwhelming. Don't you feel it?
willow_rosenberg Well, I'm... Ooh, boyfriend! My on-campus boyfriend.
buffy_summers Oh no, I forgot to pick mine up. Line's probably reallylong there, too.
willow_rosenberg How are you?
oz Good. It's pretty much a madhouse, a madhouse.
buffy_summers I know, I was just saying that to Willow. I mean it'sjust so overwhelming. Don't you feel completely disoriented?
Paul#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Oz!
oz Hey, Paul.
Paul#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Finally matriculating with us, very cool! Tell me you'replaying this week!
oz Thursday night, Alpha Delta.
willow_rosenberg Ooh! I have that one!
Paul#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 I'm bringing the wrecking crew. Jello shots? Hmm? Do you know where they're distributing the work study applications?
oz Back of Richmond Hall, next to the auditorium.
Paul#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Thanks. Seeya bro.
oz Go get'em. My band'splayed here a lot. It's still all new. I don't know what thehell's going on. Hey, Doug!
willow_rosenberg Library... ooh! Library. C'mon.
buffy_summers It's too bad Giles can't be librarian here. Be convenient.
willow_rosenberg Well, he says that he's enjoying being a gentleman of leisure.
buffy_summers Gentleman of leisure? Isn't that just british for unemployed?
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh, he's a slacker now.
buffy_summers Speaking of slack, have you heard anything from Xander?
willow_rosenberg Not for awhile, he's still on his cross-country-see-Americathing.He said he wasn't coming back until he had driven to all fifty states.
buffy_summers Did you explain about Hawaii?
willow_rosenberg Oh, he seemed so determined.
buffy_summers I hope he gets back soon. It'd be fun to have the wholegang back togetheryou know?hanging out in the... library. Wow!
willow_rosenberg Oh my gosh! Isn't this amazing?
buffy_summers It's... cozy.
willow_rosenberg You know I never wanted to hurt Giles' feelings, but occultbooks aside, our old library just didn't have the greatest selection. Butthis!
buffy_summers Yeah, this is great, you know, if we ever need a place for theNuremberg rallies.
willow_rosenberg This is a real library. See we evenhave to whisper. It's like a whole new world.
willow_rosenberg Here.
buffy_summers Thanks. Can't wait tillmom gets the bill for these books, I hope it's a funny aneurysm.
willow_rosenberg 'Introduction to Psychology.' Oh, up there.
buffy_summers I'll get'em. You know, this store discriminates againstshort people.
willow_rosenberg Oh, I think there's a protest next week.
buffy_summers Woah, oh. Oh, ahh. Oh god, I'm so sorry.
riley_finn I'm okay. It's okay. Well, that was bracing.
buffy_summers I'm so... the books were just too high, and then everythingwas bad.
riley_finn Let me give you a hand. So,uh, are you girls taking Intro Psych, or do you just want me dead?
buffy_summers Uh-huh. I mean the first one.
riley_finn Well, you'll have a lot of fun. Professor Walshshe'squite a character.
willow_rosenberg You've taken it?
riley_finn I'm a TA, I'll be helping the Professor out. I'm sorry,I've forgotten my manners in all the concussion... I'm Riley.
willow_rosenberg Willow, and this is my friend Buffy.
riley_finn It's nice to meet you both.
buffy_summers I'm nice to meet.
willow_rosenberg Hey, do you know if we're going to be studying 'Operant Conditioning'in the first semester? 'Cause I hear that's kinda Professor Walsh'sspecialty.
riley_finn Absolutely. Do you know her treatise on Dietrichs work?
willow_rosenberg I know of it.
riley_finn It's not in the syllabus, but it's a fascinating read... ifyou're in to that sort of thing. They have it here.
willow_rosenberg Oh, where?
riley_finn I'll show you. I don't meet that many freshmen that knowthat much about psychology.
willow_rosenberg Well, it's fascinating.
buffy_summers Yeah, you know, 'cause everyone's got a brain. Or, almost everyone.
buffy_summers Hi.
kathy_newman Oh, hi! Are you Buffy?
buffy_summers Yeah.
kathy_newman Kathy.
buffy_summers Hi, it's nice to meet you.
kathy_newman Yeah!
buffy_summers So, it's, ah... it's a pretty nice room.
kathy_newman Hmm! I was surprised, 'cause you hear horror stories aboutfreshmen housing. You took the right side?
buffy_summers Yeah, umm, but if you want it...
kathy_newman No, no. I just wanted to make sure that's what you wanted.Exited for classes tomorrow?
buffy_summers Painfully.
kathy_newman I bet there's going to be a lot of parties to go tothis week, too. Not that I'm a crazy partier. Oh, and I'm notalways this hyper, either. I'm just excited.
buffy_summers Yeah, me too.
kathy_newman I am really glad they put me with somebody cool... I can tellthat you're cool. I just know that this whole year is going to besuper fun!
prof_riegert The point of this course is not to critique popularAmerican culture. It is not to pick at it, or look down upon it.And it is not to watch videos for credit.The point is to examine...
buffy_summers Do you know if this class isfull yet?
prof_riegert And there are two people talking at once, and Iknow that one of them is me. And the other is... a blonde girl. You,blonde girl. Stand up. I'm very excited to hear what you haveto say that's worth interrupting my lecture for.
buffy_summers I was just asking if the class was still open, if I could stillsign up.
prof_riegert If your name isn't on thissheet then you are wasting everyone's time. Are you on the sheet?
buffy_summers They told me that if I just...
prof_riegert Do you understand? You are sucking energyfrom everyone in this room. They came here to learn. Get out!
buffy_summers I didn't mean to... suck.
prof_riegert Leave! Thankyou.
riley_finn If, uh, you're looking for Psych, it's through here.
buffy_summers Oh, thanks. How's your head?
riley_finn Sorry?
buffy_summers Yesterday. In the bookstore. You don't remember.
riley_finn Oh no, sure, I remember you. You're Willow's friend.
buffy_summers Yeah.
riley_finn My head is fine, it just stung for a bit and I lost most ofmy basic motor functions. It's no biggie. We're here. I'm sorry, I'm trying to remember you.
buffy_summers Buffy.
riley_finn Buffy, right. Have fun tonight, ok?
buffy_summers Thanks.
buffy_summers You know, I was just wondering. Professor Walsh isn'tplanning on yelling at me and kicking me out of the class, is she?
riley_finn It's not in her lesson plan.
buffy_summers Great.
willow_rosenberg How was pop culture?
buffy_summers I decided not to take it. It seemed dull.
professor_maggie_walsh Ok. This is Psych 105, 'Introduction toPsychology', I'm Professor Walsh. Those of you who fall under mygood graces will come to know me as Maggie. Those of you who don'twill come to know me by the name my TAs use, and think I don't know about,'The Evil Bitch Monster of Death.' Make no mistake, I run a hardclass, I assign a lot of work, I talk fast and I expect you to keep up. If you're looking to coast I recommend 'Geology 101,' that's where thefootball players are.
buffy_summers Ooh!
eddie Wow, sorry.
buffy_summers No, I-I wasn't looking.
eddie Did you, uh, lose your way?
buffy_summers Me? Oh, no, no, I'm just going to Fischer Hall. WhichI know is on the Earth planet. Recently voted 'Most Pathetic.' Uh-huh.
eddie Hmm, well, I'm lost and I have a map. So...
buffy_summers Ooh, I come in second. I'm Buffy, by the way.
eddie Eddie.
buffy_summers Ok, so... That's Fischer Hall,right?
eddie Ok, and this is Dunwirth Building, that's my dorm... it's just...it's us I can't find.
buffy_summers Are we the blue part?
eddie No... yes!
buffy_summers Ok, right, so I-I came from there, then we just wanna go thatway to the bike path.
eddie You sound very certain, I'm in. You're taking 'Psych 105' withProfessor Walsh.
buffy_summers Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna try. She's not afraid of the longwords, huh?
eddie Yeah, she's pretty intense. A lot of the courses are reallytough.
buffy_summers I'm a little upset. I had it on good authority that thiswas a party school.
eddie I think it's supposed to get easier.
buffy_summers I still feel like carrying around a security blanket.
eddie 'Of Human Bondage.' Have you ever read it?
buffy_summers Oh, I'm not really into porn... I mean I'm just... I'm tryingto cut way back.
eddie No, there's no actual bondage, it's just a novel.I've read it, like, ten times. I always keep it by my bed... securityblanket.
buffy_summers I don't really have a security blanket... unless you count Mr.Pointy.
eddie Mr. Pointy?
buffy_summers Oh, bike path. So it's nice to know that I'm not the onlyentirelyconfused person on this campus.
eddie I suspect there's a lot of us.
buffy_summers Well, I'll look for you in Psych.
eddie Yeah, maybe we can help each other figure out what the hellthey're talking about.
buffy_summers Ok.
eddie Maybe even make it through the year.
buffy_summers Goodnight.
eddie Night.
sunday I'm sorry... did you lose your way?
oz You looking for someone?
buffy_summers Yeah.
willow_rosenberg You made a friend? Good for you.
buffy_summers Thanks, mom.
ra Yeah, Eddie just took off, packed his stuff, left a note. Happenssometimes. People just can't handle it. There's always a fewkids who lose it early in the first semester and just bail.
ra Weak ones, I guess.
sunday Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, astonishinglyboring... we... we have to kill some cooler people. Will somebody remindme?
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 You were the one who said pickon the weak ones, thin the herd and all that. Does this sweater makeme look fat?
sunday No, the fact that you're fat makes you look fat. Thatsweater just makes you look purple.
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 You're such a loser.
sunday Hey, words can hurt like a fist.
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Hey, check it out.
sunday Well? Do we have a Klimt? Yes!
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Big score for Klimt! Monet still well in the lead, but look out for teamKlimt, coming from behind.
sunday Freshmen! Man, they're so predictable.
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 And you can never eat just one.
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Yeah, I'm hungry!
sunday What a shock. We eat when I say we eat.
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Well, we could hit the tunnels...
sunday We eat when I say we eat.
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 God, lighten up.
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 I think it's funny when you scream... it's like... whoa!
sunday I got ta get me some better lackeys. I swear, you guysare useless. I shouldn't eventake you on the hunt.
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Great! Why don't you let dead Eddie get your dinner.
sunday That's pretty much the plan.
buffy_summers Giles?
Olivine#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Rupert, is this Bleu cheese or is it just cheese that's goneblue? You're not Giles.
buffy_summers Uhm... you know the door was open, so I just... uh, Giles doesstill live here, right?
olivia He does.
olivia He appears. Rupert, you have a guest.
rupert_giles Buffy! Hello.
buffy_summers Is this a bad time?
rupert_giles No! Oh, uh, forgive me. This, uh... this is, uh,Olivia. She's, uh, an old friend, she's staying here for a few days.
olivia Couldn't pass through sunny Cal without looking up ol' Ripper.
buffy_summers Uh huh.
rupert_giles Buffy's a, uh, was a student of mine. How's, uh, how isuniversity?
buffy_summers Pretty much the same as high school, in the sense that I needhelp.
rupert_giles Ahh... help... yes.
buffy_summers But, this just looks like a bad time.
olivia No, you guys talk. I'll just go slip into something alittle less comfortable.
rupert_giles So, uh, trouble with, uh, studies?
buffy_summers This is a bad time.
rupert_giles You keep saying that.
buffy_summers Well it looks pretty bad! I think someone had just a littletoo much free time on their hands.
rupert_giles I'm not supposed to have a private life?
buffy_summers No! 'Cause you're very, very old,and it's gross.
rupert_giles Well, before I succumb to the ravages of age, why don't youtell me what brings you here.
buffy_summers There's this student missing.
rupert_giles Yes?
buffy_summers Eddie. He's supposed to have left school but... I justdon't think he did. I met him outside last night, and then I wentback where we met, and it looked there had been a struggle.
rupert_giles And?
buffy_summers And we need to stop this! And Eddie's RA said kids disappeara lot. There could be a gang of vampires working the campus. We need research, an-an-and charts and stuff.
rupert_giles I-I still don't see where I fit in. You haven't describedanything that you can't do yourself.
buffy_summers Ok, remember before you became Hugh Hefner when you used tobe a watcher?
rupert_giles Officially you know longer have a watcher. Buffy, youknow I'll always be hear when you need me. Y-your safety is moreimportant to me than anything but, you're going to have to take care ofyourself. You're out of school and I can't always be there to guideyou.
buffy_summers I'm sorry to bug you.
rupert_giles Buffy, I...
buffy_summers Oh! No! I mean yeah, you're... you're right. I can handle it. It's just that... I'm on it.
rupert_giles I-I'm here if you need me.
olivia She's gone?
rupert_giles Yes.
olivia So, did you help her?
rupert_giles I'm not sure.
buffy_summers How am I supposed to hunt in this mob? Don't you peoplehave homes?
buffy_summers Eddie?
buffy_summers Eddie! Eddie, hey, wait up!
buffy_summers God I was worried that something had happened to you...
buffy_summers ...and of course it has, 'cause you're a vampire. I'msorry.
eddie I'm not.
sunday Slayer! This is, I mean, what a challenge! The slayer!
buffy_summers And you are?
sunday I'm... I'm Sunday, I'll be killing you here in a minute orso.
buffy_summers You know that threat gets more frightening every time I hearit.
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Uhh... are we gonna fight? Or is there just gonnabe a monster sarcasm rally?
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 I'm in for a piece.
buffy_summers Everybody gets to play.
sunday Guys, this is totally mine.
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Ok, but you gotta share the eatin'. 'Cause I'm thinkin'slayer's blood's gotta beWhoa!like Thai Stick.
buffy_summers I thought people were suppose to get smarter in college?
sunday Yeah, I think you had a lot of misconceptions about college.Like that anyone would be caught dead wearing that.
sunday Don't take this the wrong way, but... You fight like a girl.
sunday Freshmen!
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 N-n-n-n-no! The best part was when you ragged onher clothes. She was like, 'No! Not the ensemble!'
sunday Those Jeans? With the little patches? She has noone to blame but herself.
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 I heard they're coming back.
sunday Not if I kill every single person who wears them.
FatVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 I still think you should've let us have a piece, we could'vefinished here off.
sunday She's not gonna last the night, she's a done deal. In fact,guys, you're gonna hit the tunnels.
buffy_summers Mom?
joyce_summers Buffy.
buffy_summers Hi.
joyce_summers Honey, how are you?
buffy_summers I'm ok.
joyce_summers How's college? You've been fighting.
buffy_summers Oh, uh, they started it.
joyce_summers Just as long as you're being careful. I-I really didn'tthink you'd show up here for a while.
buffy_summers Oh, I didn't have classes today, and everything's just beenso hectic I figured it'd be nice to come and crash for...
joyce_summers Oh, well yeah. You know, I-I didn't think you'd be backfor a couple of weeks. Uh, but I didn't move anything, it's stillyour room.
buffy_summers You filled it with packing crates.
joyce_summers Yeah, but I didn't move anything.
buffy_summers If it's still my room, shoudn't I still be able to fit in it?
joyce_summers Well it's just for a couple of weeks while we do inventory atthe gallery. I just really didn't think you'd be back so soon.
buffy_summers Neither did I.
buffy_summers Hello? Hello?
xander_harris The whole world in front of her, and she comes back to thisdive.
buffy_summers Xander!
xander_harris Hey, Buff.
buffy_summers Oh, when did you get back?
xander_harris Couple days ago.
buffy_summers You freak of nature. Why didn't you call me?
xander_harris Well I knew you guys were starting the whole college adventureand I didn't want to, um, you know... help you move.
buffy_summers I missed you. How was your trip? Is America nice? I hear it's nice.
xander_harris There's some purple mountains majesty, I'm gonna have to say.
buffy_summers What'd you do? What'd you see?
xander_harris Well...
buffy_summers Tell me!
xander_harris 'Grand Canyon!'
buffy_summers You saw the Grand Canyon!
xander_harris Well, I saw the movie 'Grand Canyon,' on cable. Reallylame.
buffy_summers Hunh?
xander_harris Basically, I got as far as Oxnard and the engine fell out ofmy car, and that was literally. So, I ended up washing dishes at'The Fabulous Ladies Night Club' for about a month and a half while I triedto pay for the repairs. No one really bothered me or even spoke tome until one night when one of the male strippers called in sick and nopower on this earth will make me tell you the rest of that story. Suffice to say I traded my car in for one that wasn't entirely made ofrust, came trundling back home to the arms of my loving parents, whereeverything was exactly as it was except I sleep in the basement and I haveto pay rent. How's college?
buffy_summers Male strippers?
xander_harris No power on this earth!
buffy_summers Ok. College is good.
xander_harris Ok, uh, once more with even less feeling.
buffy_summers No, really! I-I mean, Willow's in heaven and Oz has thisreally cool house off campus with the band.
xander_harris And you're sitting here alone at the Bronze looking like youjust got diagnosed with cancer of the puppy.
buffy_summers It's just... there was this vampire, and she took me down, andI just... I don't know how to stop her.
xander_harris Then where's the gang? Avengers assemble! Let'sget it going!
buffy_summers No, I don't want to bug them. I mean they're just startingschool, and they don't need this.
xander_harris Ok Buff, what's the 'what' here?
buffy_summers It's just, what if I can't cut it?
xander_harris Can't cut what? Slaying?
buffy_summers Slaying, everything.
xander_harris Buffy, this is all about fear. It's understandable, butyou can't let it control you. 'Fear leads to anger. Anger leadsto hate. Hate leads to anger.' No wait, hold on. 'Fearleads to hate. Hate leads to the dark side.' Hold on, no, umm, 'Firstyou get the women, then you get the money, then you...' okay, can we forgetthat?
buffy_summers Thanks for the Dadaist pep talk, I feel much more abstract now.
xander_harris The point is, you're Buffy.
buffy_summers Yeah, maybe in high school I was Buffy.
xander_harris And now in college you're Betty Louise?
buffy_summers Yeah, I'm Betty Louise Plotnick of East Cupcake, Illinois. OrI might as well be.
xander_harris Buffy, I've gone through some fairly dark times in my life,faced some scary things, among them the kitchen at 'The Fabulous LadiesNight Club.' Let me tell you something, when it's dark and I'm allalone and I'm scared or freaked out or whatever, I always think, 'Whatwould Buffy do?' You're my hero. Ok, sometimes when it's darkand I'm all alone I think, 'What is Buffy wearing?'
buffy_summers Can that be one of those things you never, ever, tell me about?
xander_harris It's a deal. Let's put this bitch in the ground! What do you say?
buffy_summers I think I say thank you.
xander_harris And nothing says thank you like dollars in the waistband. Ok,what do we do first?
buffy_summers Kids disappearing every year. Not too many, just enoughso that everyone thinks they up and left.
xander_harris I can't believe the vampires took your stuff. MurderI expect, but petty larceny seems so... petty.
buffy_summers They have to be keeping it somewhere, on campus or at leastnear by.
xander_harris Hey, how far back do the disappearances go?
buffy_summers Uhh... they weren't too common before '82.
xander_harris Match number! Check this out.
buffy_summers 'Psi Theta loses it's charter. Building to be closed forrenovation.'
xander_harris 1982. Look at this.'Former Psi Theta fraternity house lies dormant while zoning issues dragon before the city council.' We have a winner.
buffy_summers Looks pretty cherry.
xander_harris You up for a little reconnaissance?
buffy_summers You mean where we all sculpt and paint and stuff?
xander_harris No, that was the renaissance.
buffy_summers Oh. I've had a really long week. Let's go look atthe house.
buffy_summers Score!
sunday Look how tough I am.
buffy_summers Oh! That's my skirt! You're never going to fit init with those hips! We have to kill them!
xander_harris We need weapons.
buffy_summers I don't see my weapons trunk down there. It was rightby my bed. Mr. Gordo? Go to my room. If it's not there try Willow's. I'll keep an eye... my diary?!?
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Uh-oh, score!
xander_harris I'll hurry!
buffy_summers Laugh all you want, this time we play it my way. And the rules are just going to be a little bit...
buffy_summers Unh! Ahh. Ah. Oh.
sunday Say, don't I know you from... beating the crap out of you?
buffy_summers I just thought I'd drop in. Get it? Drop in? Boy, tough room.
sunday I must say, you've really got me now. I mean, it's adiabolical plan, throw yourself at my feet with a broken arm and no weaponsof any kind. How'm I going to get out of this one?
buffy_summers You got a nice set-up here, but you made one mistake.
sunday Yeah? What was that?
buffy_summers Well, I'm not actually positive, but statistically speakingpeople usually make at least...
kathy_newman It seems kind of weird.
oz Yeah, weird's a pretty good word for it.
willow_rosenberg Buffy wouldn't just take off, th-that's just not in her nature. Except for that one time she disappeared for several months and changedhe name, but there were circumstances then. There's no circumstances.
kathy_newman Does Buffy have a history of emotional problems? 'Causeon my request form I was pretty specific about a stable non-smoker.
oz I don't think this is her handwriting.
willow_rosenberg I bet there were circumstances! We've probably been sowrapped up in our own petty lives that... that we totally missed the circumstances. We're bad friends!
oz Let's think this through.
willow_rosenberg How can you be so calm?
oz Long, arduous hours of practice. Now either Buffy took off,or she was robbed, or...
xander_harris It's a prank!
willow_rosenberg Xander!
xander_harris How are my guys? I don'tknow you, do I?
kathy_newman No.
xander_harris This is very intrusive, isn't it?
kathy_newman Little bit.
xander_harris Xander.
kathy_newman Kathy.
xander_harris Do we hug?
oz I think we're too manly.
willow_rosenberg What's the prank?
xander_harris Prank? Oh, the room. Well some friends of Buffy'splayed a funny joke, and they took her stuff. And now she wants usto help get it back from her friends who sleep all day and have no tans.
willow_rosenberg Oh! Those friends!
oz Funny guys.
xander_harris They took the chest. Well, let's go! Let's go toour friend. It's nice meeting you Kathy.
kathy_newman You too!
xander_harris Let's go to Will's, get supplies.
willow_rosenberg Is Buffy in danger?
xander_harris She's in a holding pattern, we've got some time.
sunday Oh, and this. This is my favorite item.
buffy_summers You don't want to touch that.
sunday You know this arm's not looking so good. It might haveto come off.
buffy_summers You want to know the truth? I only need one.
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 This is startin' to suck.
SpicoliVamp#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season04.Episode01 Woah!
sunday What about breaking your arm,how'd that feel.
buffy_summers Let me answer that with a head butt.
buffy_summers And for the record,the arm is hurt, notbroken.
oz Hey, Buff. Need a hand?
buffy_summers No thanks, I'm good.
xander_harris So, all that other stuff in there? That's just gonnasit in there, right? Uh, I mean, no one owns it in the strictestsense.
oz It seems wrong, somehow.
xander_harris Dibs on the rowing machine.
rupert_giles Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Hi, Giles.
xander_harris What's with the arsenal?
rupert_giles I've been awake all night. I know I'm supposed to teachyou self-reliance, but I can't leave you out there to fight alone. To hell with what's right, I'm ready to back you up. Let's find theevil a-and fight it together.
buffy_summers Great! Thanks! We'll get right on that.
rupert_giles The evil is this way?
buffy_summers My room is.
willow_rosenberg Hey Giles, could you get this box on top?
xander_harris So, college not so scary after all, hunh?
buffy_summers It's turning out to be a lot like high school, which I can handle. At least I know what to expect.
