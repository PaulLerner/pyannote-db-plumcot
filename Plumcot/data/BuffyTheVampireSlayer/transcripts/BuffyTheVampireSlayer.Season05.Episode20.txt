rupert_giles Previously on
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 We had to hide the key ... made it human...
MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 ...and sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn.
buffy_summers Tell me what kind of demon I'm fighting.
quentin_travers Glory isn't a demon, she's a god.
glory Did you know your sister took my key, Dawnie, and she won't give it back. I bet you know where she put it, don't you?
spike They had to be certain the Slayer would protect it with her life, so they sent the key to her, in the form of a sister.
ben You're the key. Go. Before she finds you, she's here!
spike I love you.
buffy_summers The only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.
buffy_summers Let's see what you are.
buffy_summers Or who you are.
orlando One soldier in a vast army.
KNIGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 The key is the link. The link must be severed.
glory Where ... is ... the key?
orlando I'd die a thousand deaths before I'd tell you.
willow_rosenberg No!
willow_rosenberg Tara! No!
willow_rosenberg Tara, I'm so sorry.
buffy_summers What are you gonna need?
willow_rosenberg They gave me a lot of stuff to keep her calm.
glory I told you this wasn't over.
tara_maclay Oh, look at that, look at that. Such pure green energy!
dawn_summers Buffy!
buffy_summers We have to keep moving!
dawn_summers I can't!
glory I really hate it when people touch my things.
glory Last words, slay-runt?
buffy_summers Just one. Truck.Glory looks to her right, too late, as a huge semi smashes into her.
glory No! Not now, you idiot! Let go-
ben -of my body!
ben Oh, god.
dawn_summers A-and then whoosh! All of a sudden Glory's standing right there in front of us, all skanky and blonde and thinkin' she's all that just 'cause some bumpy heads kiss her stinky feet ... She does have nice feet. A-and she's comin' right at us, and- Buffy's just standing there not even blinking, like Bring it on, and then, wham! Hell-bitch in orbit.
xander_harris Go, Buff!
rupert_giles I knew you'd best Glory eventually, I mean all-all our years of training-
buffy_summers A truck hit her.
rupert_giles Oh.
anya You threw it at her?
dawn_summers Well, no. She more kind of waited for it to hit Glory. Uh, but then Buffy ran really fast and we got away.
buffy_summers I don't know how we got away. That truck couldn't have slowed her down for more than a second.
rupert_giles Well, how isn't important, all that matters is that the two of you are safe.
buffy_summers Safe? We've barely been able to manage not getting seriously dead every time we've crossed paths with Glory. Now that she knows that Dawn is the key?
rupert_giles There must be something in the
anya Piano!
xander_harris Because that's what we used to kill that big demon that one time!
xander_harris No wait, that-that was a rocket launcher. Ahn, what are you talking about?
anya We should drop a piano on her. Well, it always works for that creepy cartoon rabbit when he's running from that nice man with the speech impediment.
rupert_giles Yes, or perhaps we could paint a convincing tunnel on the side of a mountain. Let's just keep thinking, everyone. Perhaps we should reassemble at the magic shop, see if there's anything-
buffy_summers We can't fight her.
rupert_giles W-well not yet, no, but-
buffy_summers No, not ever. She's too strong, Giles. We're not gonna win this with, with stakes, or spells, or pulling out some uranium power core. She's a god and she's coming for us. So let's just not be here when she starts knocking.
anya Run away?
anya Finally, a sensible plan.
xander_harris That's not what she meant. Is it?
buffy_summers Well, we can't stay here! She'll just kill us off one by one until there's no one left standing between her and Dawn.
rupert_giles Buffy, we all understand the severity of the situation, but there must be another way.
buffy_summers No. We stay, we die. Show of hands for that option.
buffy_summers All right. Nobody goes home, nobody tells anybody we're leaving. Just pack up whatever supplies we need and that's it, we're gone.
dawn_summers Cool. Don't have to study for that geometry test.
xander_harris What about wheels? I don't think everybody's gonna fit in the Xandermobile.
buffy_summers Just get your stuff together. I'll handle the rest.
gronx This is, this is terrible. I'll never be able to mend this.
ben Not really my color anyway.
gronx Oh, yes. Inappropriate humor. Most amusing. Don't suppose you know what led to this sartorial tragedy.
ben That's not how it works, you know that.
gronx Yes, of course. I just thought maybe after her magnificent incandescence was returned to this ... manly and ... painfully handsome assemblage ... you might have noticed something interesting? A key in human form, perhaps? Lounging about unattended?
ben If I did, do you really think I would tell you?
gronx Why do you insist on fighting the inevitable? No one can stand against her blindingly scrumptious luminescence.
ben Glory. Her name is Glory, and she's your god, you little scab, not mine.
gronx With all due respect and-and fear of sharp objects, you exist, sir, only because of her divine greatness.
ben You mean her divine failure, don't you?
ben I didn't ask for any of this. I just want to be normal.
gronx We play the hand we're dealt.
ben Nothing's mine, is it? This life, this body, it's all infected. The only thing I ever cared about she's taken away from me. You know why I wanted to be a doctor?
gronx Flattering drawstring pants?
ben To be close to people. To witness their lives and their deaths, to be there alongside them, a part of everyday humanity. Maybe it's the drugs.
gronx Drugs, sir?
ben Find the right combination, keep her buried where she belongs.
gronx Impossible! Her magnificence can never be fully contained! She is a perfect, all-encompassing light, one you should feel honored to be bathed in.
ben Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled. Especially with the part where she gets her key back and I cease to exist.
gronx True, this oh-so-appealing form will of necessity be shrugged off.
ben Not if I get the key first.
gronx And if you did ... what then? Could you do it? Take a human life with your own hands? Oblivion is such a small inconvenience in the service of a deity. Accept your fate. I mean, you said it yourself. This life was never really yours anyway, was it?
ben It doesn't matter how I came by it. It's mine. And I plan on keeping it.
anya Anybody else feel that?
willow_rosenberg What?
anya Cold draft of paralyzing fear.
rupert_giles We just need to stay calm.
willow_rosenberg Calm, right.
xander_harris Hey, we gotta be like Sergeant Rock. Cool and collected in the face of overwhelming odds.
anya *Over*whelming? How much more than whelming would that be exactly?
rupert_giles Look, everything will be all right, we just need to stay here calmly. As soon as Buffy arrives-
rupert_giles -we'll feel oddly worse.
rupert_giles What's he doing here?
spike Just out for a jaunt. Thought I'd swing by and say howdy.
rupert_giles Out.
buffy_summers He's here because we need him.
xander_harris The hell we do.
buffy_summers If Glory finds us, he's the only one besides me that has any chance of protecting Dawn.
xander_harris Buffy, come on-
buffy_summers Look, this isn't a discussion! He stays. Get over it.
spike Buckle up, kids. Daddy's puttin' the hammer down.
nurse Sign here.
nurse Okay, that should do it.
dante_chavalier See. Did I not tell you how easy it would be for us to-
nurse Hey!
nurse My pen.
orlando The trees are singing water.
general_gregor You have him.
dante_chavalier Yes, General.
dante_chavalier Our brother has returned to the fold.
general_gregor Welcome home, Orlando. I swear by my sword your sacrifice ... will not go unavenged.
orlando Shiny.
general_gregor Yes, I suppose it is.
orlando Pretty little girl, she's shiny too.
general_gregor Watch him, make sure he's comfortable.
orlando So shiny. Pretty little shiny key.
general_gregor The key? You've seen it?
orlando Pretty ... little shiny girl.
general_gregor The monks, they've made it human.
dante_chavalier We know the Slayer's protecting the key. If what Orlando says is true...
general_gregor Prepare to advance!
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 Yes sir.
general_gregor We end this now.
anya Shouldn't somebody be asking, Are we there yet?
anya Isn't that what small entertaining children do?
dawn_summers That kinda only works if you know where you're going.
anya Do we know where we're going yet?
spike We'd already be somewhere if Captain Slowpoke would give up the wheel. Hey! Gramps! Bloody step on it!
rupert_giles Step on what? I've driven tricycles with more power.
xander_harris Is anybody else queasy?
anya He doesn't travel well. He's like fine shrimp.
spike I shoulda nicked that Porsche I had my eye on. There's just enough room for me, you, and big sis.
spike What?
xander_harris Would you give it a rest, or...
spike Or what, you're gonna toss your cookies on my shoes?
xander_harris Or you can be undead man walking. See how fast you can hitch a ride with a flaming thumb.
spike Fine. Shrimp.
xander_harris That guy is bloodsuckin' the last nerve right outta me.
rupert_giles Well, Buffy has a point. In a confrontation, Spike may prove...
rupert_giles ...useful.
xander_harris I don't know if Buffy's thinkin' too clear on that one, or anything else right now. I've never seen her so...
rupert_giles She's ... been through more than her fair share of late. She just needs a chance to catch her breath, regroup. She'll be all right.
xander_harris Yeah. She'll ... Yeah.
dawn_summers Any luck?
willow_rosenberg Uh, if you define luck as the absence of success, plenty. There's a couple barrier spells, but... they only work on a fixed locus. Haven't found anything that'll work while we're still moving.
tara_maclay So pretty, can I have one?
willow_rosenberg Come on.
dawn_summers Anyone hungry?
anya Ooh! Snacks! The secret to any successful migration.
anya Who's up for some tasty fried meat products?
spike Hey! Aah!
willow_rosenberg Tara, no! What did I tell you?
willow_rosenberg Shh.
willow_rosenberg I'm sorry. She, she didn't mean to.
willow_rosenberg She doesn't know what she's doing.
dawn_summers We know.
spike No biggie. Look, the skin's already stopped smoking. You go ahead and play ... peek-a-boo with Mister Sunshine all you like. It keeps the ride from getting boring.
tara_maclay All the light is gone.
willow_rosenberg No, shh, baby. The light's still outside, okay?
tara_maclay All dark. All dark.
gronx It's coming. The signs are in alignment, and soon victory will be in our grasp. All we need do is seize the moment ... and squeeze until it bleeds.
dawn_summers Hey. I think Anya's gonna try to cook. Wanna come watch the tears and recriminations?
buffy_summers Maybe later.
dawn_summers Thanks.
buffy_summers For what?
dawn_summers You know. Pretty much everything.
buffy_summers Yeah. I'm doin' a great job.
dawn_summers You are.
buffy_summers I'm the Slayer. The chosen one. All mythic and defender-y. Evil nasties are supposed to flee from me. Not the other way around.
dawn_summers You're not fleeing. You're ... moving at a brisk pace.
buffy_summers Quaintly referred to in some cultures as the big scaredy runaway.
dawn_summers It's the most amazing thing anyone's ever done for me.
buffy_summers It just keeps coming. Glory ... Riley ... Tara ... Mom.
dawn_summers I know. But there's a bright side.
buffy_summers There is?
dawn_summers At least things can't get any crazier. Right?
buffy_summers You know this is your fault for saying that.
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 Come on now!
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 Bring up the rear! Let's go!
buffy_summers Giles!
rupert_giles I see them.
spike See who?
xander_harris Arrows!
spike Bloody hell!
xander_harris They're throwing arrows!
buffy_summers Dawn, get down under the table.
tara_maclay Horsies!
willow_rosenberg Tara!
rupert_giles Weapons?
spike Hello! You're driving one!
willow_rosenberg Don't hit the horsies!
buffy_summers Oh, we won't!
buffy_summers Aim for the horsies.
xander_harris Did we shake 'em?
buffy_summers Stay low!
buffy_summers Watch out for the-
spike Now might be a good time for something heroic.
buffy_summers Xander! Hatch!
dawn_summers Keep the pressure on.
spike I always do, sweet bit.
anya Not a piano, but hey.
rupert_giles Everyone all right?
xander_harris We gotta find shelter.
spike Yeah, right bloody quick. I'm burning up out here.
buffy_summers Careful.
buffy_summers Spike.
xander_harris Careful. Up.
buffy_summers Okay, Will?
willow_rosenberg I'm on it.
willow_rosenberg Oh, careful!
buffy_summers Are you sure you're okay?
dawn_summers Yeah. B-but Spike's hurt.
spike Ow! Easy with the delicates.
buffy_summers They'll heal.
spike Florence bloody Nightingale to the rescue.
anya Um, you have another plan, right? One that doesn't involve pointy knives and a Winnebago?
buffy_summers We-we-we'll rest here for a minute, but then we have to keep moving.
xander_harris Where?
buffy_summers I don't know! We just, we, we, we can't, can't stay here. I-it's too close to the wreck, we're too easy to find.
willow_rosenberg Buffy!
buffy_summers Will, how is he?
buffy_summers Will?
willow_rosenberg I-I think I slowed the bleeding, but...
buffy_summers Okay. Okay, just-just give me a minute.
buffy_summers Dawn, get down!
xander_harris We got company.
xander_harris And they brought a crusade.
buffy_summers Willow!
willow_rosenberg I'm working on it!
KNIGHTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 Go! Go! Go! Let's move! Come on, move it!
dawn_summers Buffy!
KNIGHT#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 It's clear!
general_gregor The key.
willow_rosenberg Enemies, fly and fall.
willow_rosenberg Circling arms, raise a wall.
dante_chavalier They have the general. Clerics!
cleric_1 Energy barrier. A most powerful one.
dante_chavalier Can it be breached?
cleric_1 The witch's magic pales to the might of our god. The infidels' wall ... shall tumble before us.
buffy_summers Will? How long will it hold?
willow_rosenberg Half a day maybe.
willow_rosenberg Or till Heckle and Jeckle punch a hole through it.
spike So. What's the story with these role-playing rejects?
buffy_summers Let's find out.
spike You sure Scarface here can habla the English?
buffy_summers He understands me. Don't you?
general_gregor You were warned we would return, Slayer.
buffy_summers Took you long enough. What are you supposed to be, some kind of chief?
general_gregor General.
buffy_summers General. In charge of what, getting captured?
general_gregor You do not frighten me, child. The instrument of chaos must be destroyed.
buffy_summers Look at her that way again, and she will be the last thing you ever see.
general_gregor As I've been told, you protect the key of the beast.
buffy_summers It's not that simple.
general_gregor Yes. The key has been transformed, given ... breath, life. Yet, this makes no difference. The key is the link. The link must be severed. Such is the will of god.
buffy_summers She doesn't remember anything about being this key you're all looking for. The only thing that she remembers is growing up with a mother, and a sister that love her. What kind of god would demand her life for something that she has no control over?
buffy_summers We are not your enemy. Tell your men to stand down.
general_gregor No.
buffy_summers It is not her fault! She's human now!
general_gregor The key is too dangerous ... to be allowed to exist. No matter what form it has been pressed into.
buffy_summers I will not let anyone tell me-
willow_rosenberg Shh, shh, shh.
buffy_summers What happened?
anya I-I don't know, she just went nuts.
tara_maclay Time! Time, time!
willow_rosenberg Tara! We have to do something! She, she can't stay this way. Buffy!
tara_maclay Time... time... time...
PATIENTS#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode20 Time. Time.
nurse No, it's not time for your meds, just lie back-
nurse Doctor! Doctor McCarthy!
orlando It's time. It's time.
dante_chavalier No, no, shh. There's nothing to fear, my brother.
dante_chavalier The beast may have taken your mind, but I swear to you, she will never know the taste of your heart.
dante_chavalier Clerics! I want the witch's barrier down. NOW!
buffy_summers I'm sorry.
rupert_giles For what?
buffy_summers We should have stayed. If we had, none of this would have happened.
rupert_giles Don't. What you did ... w-was necessary ... what I've always admired.
buffy_summers Running away?
rupert_giles Being able to place ... your heart ... above all else.
rupert_giles I'm so proud of you. You've come so far. You're everything a Watcher ... everything I could have hoped for.
buffy_summers Willow.
buffy_summers Open a door.
dante_chavalier Speak.
buffy_summers One of my friends was hurt when you attacked us.
dante_chavalier And ten of my men are dead. Honorable men. Shall we balance the scale?
buffy_summers Will you let someone come and help him or not?
dante_chavalier Give quarter to an agent of the beast? What madness would move me to such action?
buffy_summers I'm done asking.
xander_harris Whoa, whoa, hey! Uh ... this is war, isn't it? And if there's one thing I've learned from Sergeant Rock, it is in war ... there are rules.
xander_harris Or at least there should be, if you're as honorable as you think you are. Plus, we do have your general forehead guy.
willow_rosenberg Discharge and bring life.
spike Handier than a Swiss knife. Look, the door to my crypt's got this nasty squeak, maybe you could...
buffy_summers Hey, uh, i-it's Buffy. I need to ask you a really big favor.
ben You, uh, forgot to mention the costume party outside.
buffy_summers Sorry. I-I didn't know who else to call.
ben No, it's okay. I mean, yeah, not ... how I pictured seeing you again, but, uh ... I'll take what I can get.
buffy_summers Thank you ... for coming.
ben My pleasure.
ben All right, I think I got him stabilized, but there's a lot of damage. We need to get him out of here.
buffy_summers Well, I think the guys with the pointy swords kinda have other ideas.
ben Don't they always.
buffy_summers Look, I know this must seem extra Outer Limits to you.
ben This? Naah. I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
ben You know, emergency room, full moon on a Saturday night.
buffy_summers Look, if this gets too weird, just tell me. I'll understand.
ben Don't worry about me. I won't leave until I've worn out my welcome.
spike Ow.
spike Thanks.
xander_harris You know, those things'll kill you.
xander_harris Oh. Right.
xander_harris I mention today how much I don't like you?
spike You mighta let it slip in ... once or twice.
xander_harris How're your feelers?
spike Nothing compared to the little bits we're gonna get chopped into when the Renaissance Faire kicks the door in. And here we bloody sit.
xander_harris It's not like we got much of a choice.
spike Could make a break for it! Use General Armor-All as a shield get to the doc's car, and-
xander_harris Great plan. And while all the hacking and slashing's going on, what are you gonna be doing, huh? Throwing migraines at 'em?
spike Look, we stay here, we all die! At least this way, some of us might get-
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers We're all gonna make it. I'm not losing anyone.
buffy_summers Check the supplies. See if anyone's hungry.
general_gregor Dissention in the ranks. Seldom a harbinger of glad tidings.
buffy_summers Shut up.
general_gregor Poor frightened girl. You've no idea what you've gotten yourself into.
buffy_summers Why don't you tell me?
general_gregor Would it make a difference?
general_gregor What do you know of the beast?
buffy_summers Strong. Fast. Hellgod.
general_gregor From a dimension of unspeakable torment.
buffy_summers A demon dimension. I know. She ruled with two other hellgods, right?
general_gregor Along with the beast they were a triumvirate of suffering and despair. Ruling with equal vengeance. But the beast's power grew beyond even what they could conceive. As did her lust for pain and misery. They looked upon her, what she had become ... and trembled.
buffy_summers A god afraid?
general_gregor Such was her power. They feared she would attempt to seize their dimension for herself, and decided to strike first. A great battle erupted. In the end, they stood victorious over the beast ... barely. She was cast out. Banished to this lower plane of existence, forced to live and eventually die trapped within the body of a mortal ... a newborn male, created as her prison. That is the beast's ... only weakness.
buffy_summers Kill the man ... and the god dies.
general_gregor Unfortunately, the identity of the human vessel has never been discovered.
buffy_summers I don't understand. Now, I've seen Glory. Not a whole lot going on in the hairy chest department.
general_gregor You have seen a glimpse of the true beast. Her power was too great to be completely contained. She's found a way to escape her mortal prison ... for brief periods, before her energies are exhausted and she's forced back ... into her living cell of meat and bone.
dawn_summers What about me?
dawn_summers What about the key?
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers I want to know.
general_gregor The key ... is almost as old as the beast itself. Where it came from, how it was created ... the deepest of mysteries. All that is certain is that its power is absolute. Countless generations of my people have sacrificed their lives in search of it, to destroy it before its wrath could be unleashed.
dawn_summers But the monks found it first.
general_gregor Yes, and hid it with their magicks.
buffy_summers Why didn't they just destroy it? If the key is as dangerous as-
general_gregor Because they were fools. They thought they could harness its power for the forces of light. They failed, and paid with their blood.
dawn_summers What do I do? What was I created for?
general_gregor You were created ... to open the gates that separate dimensions. The beast will use your power ... to return home and seize control of the hell she was banished from.
buffy_summers That's it? That's Glory's master plan ... to go home?
general_gregor You misunderstand. Once the key is activated, it won't just open the gates to the beast's dimension. It's going to open all the gates. The walls separating realities will crumble. Dimensions will bleed into each other. Order will be overthrown and the universe will tumble into chaos ... all dark ... forever.
general_gregor That ... is what you were created for.
buffy_summers Dawn.
dawn_summers You think it's true ... what he said?
buffy_summers I don't know.
dawn_summers Destroyer of the universe. I guess cutting school doesn't seem so bad now, huh?
buffy_summers It's not you. You know that.
dawn_summers But it's in me ... isn't it? It's inside me.
dawn_summers What are we gonna do?
buffy_summers I won't let anything happen to you. I promise.
tara_maclay Wriggling!
willow_rosenberg Come on, Tara, you have to eat something.
anya Want me to try?
willow_rosenberg I don't know. I'm gettin' used to pickin' fruit out of my hair.
general_gregor You!
general_gregor You are not a part of this, are you?
ben Just a friend of the family.
general_gregor Would you die for them?
general_gregor Because that is what your future holds if you align yourself with the Slayer and her misguided people.
ben It's my life, and I'll do what I please with it.
general_gregor It's not just your life. Unimaginable legions will perish, including everyone here. You can stop this. You can save all their lives by ending one. The little girl. The key. Destroy it, and the will of the beast will be broken, she will fade, a distant memory ... and all of this madness will end.
ben Sorry.
dawn_summers Is ... is he gonna be okay?
ben He was hurt pretty bad, Dawn.
dawn_summers It's because of me. It's all my fault.
ben No it isn't.
dawn_summers You don't know what's happening.
ben I don't have to. I just know that sometimes terrible things happen to good people. It shouldn't, but ... it does.
ben It's nobody's fault.
ben It's just the way life is.
dawn_summers Is that gonna help?
dawn_summers Ben?
ben You have to let me out.
dawn_summers Ben?
ben You don't understand, I gotta get out, open a door now!
buffy_summers What happened?
dawn_summers I-I don't know, he just freaked out.
ben Let me out!
buffy_summers Okay, W-Will, open a door.
ben No! Ha!
glory Well, what do you know. Little Ben finally did something right.
general_gregor The beast.
glory Hey, it's Gregor.
glory Now it's not.
dawn_summers Buffy!
glory Yeah, right!
buffy_summers Dawn!!
buffy_summers Willow!
buffy_summers Get it down, now!
willow_rosenberg Hear, hear my plea.
willow_rosenberg Circling arm protecting me.
willow_rosenberg We have to-
dante_chavalier The beast.
spike The car. Get the keys.
willow_rosenberg Buffy! Buffy, we have to find Dawn. We, we can't let Glory-
willow_rosenberg Buffy? Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, you have to get up! We need you!
willow_rosenberg Buffy, please! Buffy...
