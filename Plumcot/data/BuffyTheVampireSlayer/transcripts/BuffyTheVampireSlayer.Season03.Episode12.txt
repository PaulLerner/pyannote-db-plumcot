buffy_summers Gotcha!
angel Uhh! Right in the heart.
buffy_summers Satisfied?
angel I'm not sure that's the word.
buffy_summers Okay.
buffy_summers I didn't mean 'satisfied' like...
angel No, I, I wasn't trying to...
buffy_summers 'Cause we're not having satisfaction in the personal sense.
angel Of course.
buffy_summers I should go. Giles is...
angel ...is waiting for you. I know.
buffy_summers Thanks. For the workout.
angel Um, am I gonna see you this weekend? You, uh, you-you probably have plans.
buffy_summers Right, birthday. Um, actually, I, I do have a thing.
angel Oh, a thing. A date?
buffy_summers Nice attempt at casual. Actually, I do have a date. Older man. Very handsome. He likes it when I call him 'Daddy'.
angel Huh, your father. It is your father, right?
buffy_summers He's taking me to the ice show. Which should be big fun. I could use a little fun.
rupert_giles This one?
buffy_summers Amethyst.
rupert_giles Used for?
buffy_summers Breath mints?
rupert_giles Charm bags, money spells, and for cleansing one's aura.
buffy_summers Okay, so how do you know if one's aura's dirty? Somebody come by with a finger and write 'wash me' on it?
rupert_giles Buffy, I'm aware of your distaste for studying vibratory stones, but since it is part of your training, I would appreciate your glib-free attention.
buffy_summers Sorry. It's just with Faith on one of her unannounced walkabouts, I feel like somebody should be patrolling.
rupert_giles Well, Faith is not interested in proper training, so I must rely on you to keep up with yours.
buffy_summers I hate being the good one.
rupert_giles And as for patrolling, well, you'll be there soon enough. Why so anxious?
buffy_summers I guess it... I just have some... energy to burn.
rupert_giles Well, in due time, but, uh, for the present, if it's not entirely beyond your capabilities, try to concentrate.
buffy_summers Wow, that was really funny-looking! Could you do it again?
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode12 I'll kill you for that.
buffy_summers For that? What were you trying to kill me for before?
buffy_summers Okay, so here's the deal.
Vampire#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode12 Lemme know if I'm not doing this right.
rupert_giles Bit early in the day.
buffy_summers Giles, something's wrong.
rupert_giles Wrong?
rupert_giles Ah. Perhaps you shouldn't... ...do that anymore.
buffy_summers On top of that, I got a bad case of the dizzies last night and almost let a vamp stake me. With my own stake!
buffy_summers I'm way off my game. My game's left the country. It's in Cuernavaca. Giles, what's going on here?
rupert_giles Well, perhaps you've got a bad flu bug or something.
buffy_summers No. No, not sick. I *can't* get sick. My dad's coming to take me to the ice show. We do it every year for my birthday. If I cancel, it's gonna break his heart.
rupert_giles Well, just, um, take it easy for forty-eight hours. You know, forego patrolling until you feel yourself again.
buffy_summers No. No, I just need to spend a little more time training.
buffy_summers I'm gone!
rupert_giles Thank you!
xander_harris An ice show? A show performed on ice. And how old are we again?
willow_rosenberg I went to Snoopy On Ice when I was little. My dad took me backstage and I got so scared I threw up on Woodstock.
buffy_summers Look, I know you guys think it's just a big, dumb, girlie thing, but it's not. I mean, a lot of those skaters are Olympic medal winners. And every year my dad buys me cotton candy and one of those souvenir programs that has all the pictures, and okay, it's a big, dumb, girlie thing, but I love it.
oz It's not so girlie. Ice is cool! It's water, but it's not.
willow_rosenberg I think it's sweet you and your dad have a tradition. Especially now that he's not around so much. Ixnay on the caramel corn, though, if you go backstage.
xander_harris We're still talking party, right? I mean, some of us still love to relish celebrating in the birth of the Buff.
buffy_summers I dunno. I think it might be time to put a moratorium on parties in my honor. They tend to go badly. Monsters crash. People die.
willow_rosenberg But eighteen is a *big* one, Buffy. I mean, you can vote now. You can be drafted. You can vote not to be drafted.
buffy_summers I think I'll choose to celebrate this one with quiet reflection.
xander_harris Where is it written that quiet reflection can't be combined with cake and funny hats?
joyce_summers Buffy?
buffy_summers Present.
buffy_summers Ooo, present!
joyce_summers Uh, they're not. They're from your father.
joyce_summers His, uh, quarterly projections are unraveling and he can't afford to take off right now. He promises to make it up to you. It's all right there in the letter.
joyce_summers I-if you want, I could ask somebody to cover for me at the gallery. I-I mean, if you want me to take you.
buffy_summers No. No, that's not necessary. I-I was just thinking it might be nice to have a quiet birthday.
quentin_travers How much longer, Hobson?
hobson Five, maybe six hours, sir.
quentin_travers Once you finish, you and Blair can get some rest. But sleep in shifts.
quentin_travers We're getting very close. The Slayer's preparation is nearly complete.
buffy_summers You know, it's not just cartoon characters. They do pieces from operas and ballets. Brian Boitano, doing Carmen, is a life changer. Oh, he doesn't actually play Carmen, but a lot of sophisticated people go.
rupert_giles Yes, I think we should start with the grounding crystal again.
buffy_summers You know, it's usually something that families do together.
rupert_giles Now, look very carefully for the tiny flaw at its core.
buffy_summers I-if someone were free, they'd take their daughters or their student... or their Slayer.
rupert_giles Hmm? Yes, but, Buffy, I think we should concentrate now. Now, look for the flaw at its center.
rupert_giles Buffy?
buffy_summers Oh, I'm sorry. Did I zone out on you? It's just... I'm nursing that flu bug.
rupert_giles It's best to take care of that. Perhaps we should, um...
buffy_summers ...call it a night. Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks.
rupert_giles Good night.
buffy_summers So, how's it going with Amy the rat?
willow_rosenberg Good! She loves her new exercise wheel. She runs around, her nose wiggles...
buffy_summers I-I meant, how's it going changing her back into a human being?
willow_rosenberg Oh. Still working on it. But I just got her the cutest little bell...
guy You don't do that to me! I waited for you at the Bronze all night!
cordelia_chase And the big deal is?
guy You made me look like some kind of dork in front of my posse!
cordelia_chase First of all, 'posse'? Passe'! Second of all, anyone with a teaspoon of brains knows not to take my flirting seriously. Especially with my extenuating circumstances.
guy What circumstances?
cordelia_chase Rebound! Look it up!
guy Hey! I'm not through here.
buffy_summers Oh, I beg to differ.
cordelia_chase What is wrong with you?
guy Ow.
guy God, the chick started it!
willow_rosenberg Are you okay?
buffy_summers Okay, I just got swatted down by some no-neck and rescued by Cordelia. What the hell is happening?
rupert_giles I'm sure it'll sort itself out.
buffy_summers You're not getting the big picture here. I-I have *no* strength. I have *no* coordination. I throw knives like...
rupert_giles A girl?
buffy_summers Like I'm not the Slayer.
rupert_giles Look, Buffy, I, I, I assure you, um... given time... w-w-we'll get to the bottom of, of whatever's causing this, um... anomaly.
buffy_summers Promise me.
rupert_giles Yes. I give you my word.
quentin_travers You're having doubts.
quentin_travers Cruciamentum is not easy... for Slayer or Watcher. But it's been done this way for a dozen centuries. Whenever a Slayer turns eighteen. It's a time-honored rite of passage.
rupert_giles It's an archaic exercise in cruelty. To lock her in this... tomb... weakened, defenseless. And to unleash *that* on her.
rupert_giles If any one of the Council still had actual contact with a Slayer, they would see, but I'm the one in the thick of it.
quentin_travers Which is why you're not qualified to make this decision. You're too close.
rupert_giles That's not true.
quentin_travers A Slayer is not just physical prowess. She must have cunning, imagination, a confidence derived from self-reliance. And believe me, once this is all over, your Buffy will be stronger for it.
rupert_giles Or she'll be dead for it.
quentin_travers Rupert, if this girl is everything you say, then you've nothing to worry about.
hobson Uh, sir, if you can spare me for a short spell, I'll need to make a run to the hardware store. I just need some...
quentin_travers Take care of it.
quentin_travers Come on. Come on.
blair Kralik, your pills. Open your mouth.
quentin_travers That's enough. Close it up.
willow_rosenberg Aha! A curse on Slayers.
willow_rosenberg Oh, no. Wait. I-it's lawyers.
xander_harris You know, maybe we're on the wrong track with the whole spell, curse and whammy thing. Maybe what we should be looking for is something like, um, Slayer kryptonite.
oz Faulty metaphor. Kryptonite kills.
xander_harris You're assuming I meant the green kryptonite. I was referring, of course, to the red kryptonite, which drains Superman of his powers.
oz Wrong. The gold kryptonite's the power-sucker. The red kryptonite mutates Superman into some sort of weird...
buffy_summers Guys? Reality?
willow_rosenberg Buffy. I know you are *definitely*, without a doubt, gonna get your powers back.
buffy_summers Thanks, Will.
willow_rosenberg But what if you don't?
buffy_summers Okay... if I don't get my powers back, then I don't. I'll deal. And there's a whole lotta good sides to it.
willow_rosenberg Actually, this could open up so many...
buffy_summers Giles. Did you find anything?
rupert_giles Uh, no. Not yet.
hobson It's your shift.
rack Pills!
blair Yes.
blair It's coming!
rack Pills!
blair Take them.
rack Pills!
blair They're right in front of you.
rack Where?
blair Here!
rack I can't see... can't... can't reach it.
blair Open your eyes.
rack Shh. Everything's okay now.
buffy_summers Thank you. That's beautiful.
angel You really like it?
buffy_summers Of course I do. It's sweet and thoughtful and... full of neat words to learn and say like 'wilt' and 'henceforth'.
angel Then why'd you seem more excited last year when you got a severed arm in a box?
buffy_summers I'm sorry. Uh, it's just suddenly there's this chance that my calling's a wrong number, and... it's just freaking me out a little.
angel That's understandable.
buffy_summers Angel, what if I have lost my power?
angel You lived a long time without it. You can do it again.
buffy_summers I guess. But what if I can't? I've seen too much. I know what goes bump in the night. Not being able to fight it... What if I just hide under my bed, all scared and helpless? Or what if I just become pathetic? Hanging out at the old Slayer's home, talking people's ears off about my glory days, showing them Mr. Pointy, the stake I had bronzed.
angel Buffy, you could never be helpless or boring, not even if you tried.
buffy_summers Don't be so sure.
buffy_summers Before I was the Slayer, I was... Well, I, I don't wanna say shallow, but... Let's say a certain person, who will remain nameless, we'll just call her Spordelia, looked like a classical philosopher next to me. Angel, if I'm not the Slayer, what do I do? What do I have to offer? Why would you like me?
angel I saw you before you became the Slayer.
buffy_summers What?
angel I watched you, and I saw you called. It was a bright afternoon out in front of your school. You walked down the steps... and... and I loved you.
buffy_summers Why?
angel 'Cause I could see your heart. You held it before you for everyone to see. And I worried that it would be bruised or torn. And more than anything in my life I wanted to keep it safe... to warm it with my own.
buffy_summers That's beautiful. Or taken literally, incredibly gross.
angel I was just thinking that, too.
rack Ah, you're up. I was afraid I drained you too much. I do that sometimes.
rack Ever have a tune you can't get outta your head? It keeps playing over and over and over? Drives me nuts.
rack Ahh. Thank you.
rack Ohh. That... is much better.
rack Mmm.
rack It's a game, you know. We're not gonna play by their rules, but... that doesn't mean we're not gonna play.
rack Mmm. Why don't you call your friend in? We'll discuss it over dinner.
rupert_giles Quentin?
rupert_giles Hello? Quentin? Hob...
Man#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season03.Episode12 Let's find out. Hey, sweet girl! How much for a lap dance for me and my buddy?
buffy_summers Walk me home, Angel. No, I'm fine. I can take care of myself.
buffy_summers Hummers. Big turnoff. I like guys that can remember the lyrics.
rack You know, I wish I could, but my mind just isn't what it used to be.
buffy_summers Let me go.
rack You didn't say please!
buffy_summers HELP ME! SOMEBODY, PLEASE!
buffy_summers HELP ME, PLEASE! SOMEBODY!
buffy_summers SOMEBODY, PLEASE HELP ME!
buffy_summers STOP! PLEASE, I NEED HELP!
buffy_summers PLEASE, STOP!
rupert_giles Hurry!
buffy_summers When I hit him, it felt like my arm was broken, it hurt so much. I can't be just a person. I can't be helpless like that. Giles, please, we have to figure out what's happening to me.
rupert_giles It's an organic compound... of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressers. The effect is temporary. You'll be yourself again in a few days.
buffy_summers You?
rupert_giles It's a test, Buffy. It's given to the Slayer once she... uh, well, if she reaches her eighteenth birthday. The Slayer is disabled and then entrapped with a vampire foe whom she must defeat in order to pass the test. The vampire you were to face... has escaped. His name is Zackary Kralik. As a mortal, he murdered and tortured more than a dozen women before he was committed to an asylum for the criminally insane. When a vamp...
buffy_summers You bastard. All this time, you saw what it was doing to me. All this time, and you didn't say a word!
rupert_giles I wanted to.
buffy_summers Liar.
rupert_giles In matters of tradition and protocol, I must answer to the Council.
rupert_giles My role in this... was very specific. I was to administer the injections and to direct you to the old boardinghouse on Prescott Lane.
buffy_summers I can't... I can't hear this.
rupert_giles Buffy, please.
buffy_summers Who are you? How could you do this to me?
rupert_giles I am deeply sorry, Buffy, and you have to understand...
buffy_summers If you touch me, I'll kill you.
rupert_giles You have to listen to me. Because I've told you this, the test is invalidated. You will be safe now, I promise you. Now, whatever I have to do to deal with Kralik... and to win back your trust...
buffy_summers You stuck a needle in me. You poisoned me!
cordelia_chase What's going on?
cordelia_chase Oh, God. Is the world ending? I have to research a paper on Bosnia for tomorrow, but if the world's ending, I'm not gonna bother.
rupert_giles You can't walk home alone, Buffy. It isn't safe.
buffy_summers I don't know you.
cordelia_chase Did something take her memory? He's Giles. Giiillles. He hangs out here a lot.
buffy_summers Cordelia, could you please drive me home?
cordelia_chase Of course.
cordelia_chase But if the world doesn't end, I'm gonna need a note.
joyce_summers Buffy?
rack Mother.
rack Mother.
rack May I call you Mother? My own mother was a person with no self-respect of her own, so she tried to take mine.
rack Ten years old, she had the scissors. You wouldn't believe what she took with those. But she's dead to me now. Mostly because I killed and ate her, but also because I know I won't be alone much longer. I'll have your daughter. I won't kill her; I'll just make her like me. Different. She'll go to sleep, and when she wakes up, your face will be the first thing she eats.
rack I have a problem with mothers. I'm aware of that.
rupert_giles I was just trying to reach you.
quentin_travers I was on watch over by the boardinghouse.
rupert_giles Then you know what's happened.
quentin_travers Yes.
rupert_giles He's killed Hobson and made Blair one of his own. Your perfectly controlled test seems to have spun rather impressively out of control, don't you think?
quentin_travers It changes nothing.
rupert_giles Well, then, allow me. I've told Buffy everything.
quentin_travers That is in direct opposition to the Council's orders.
rupert_giles Yes. Interestingly, I don't give a rat's ass about the Council's orders. There will be no test.
quentin_travers The test has already begun. Your Slayer entered the field of play about ten minutes ago.
rupert_giles Why?
quentin_travers I don't know. I returned there just as she entered.
quentin_travers Now Giles, we've no business...
rupert_giles This is *not* business!
rack Hide and seeeek...
rack Hide and seek!
rack Why did you come to the dark of the woods?
rack To bring all these sweets to grandmother's house?
rack Oh-oh, no, no. Just a little lower. Right... Oh, yes. Yes. Oh. Oooh! Thank you very much.
rack If you stray from the path, you will lose your way.
rack I won't take it all. I won't take it all.
rack No! No! No!
joyce_summers Buffy?
joyce_summers Buffy, we have to get out...
rack Where are they? Where are they?!
rack You don't seem to understand your place in all of this. Do you have any idea...
rack Oh, my! What have you...
rack My pills!
rack No. No...
buffy_summers If I was at full Slayer power, I'd be punning right about now.
rack No! No!
joyce_summers Buffy, thank God you're okay. Oh, that man...
buffy_summers I can't get these. They're too tight.
joyce_summers Can't you just...
buffy_summers Not right now. Maybe there's some clippers around.
joyce_summers Oh, Buffy!
quentin_travers Congratulations, you passed.
quentin_travers You exhibited extraordinary courage and clearheadedness in battle. The Council is very pleased.
buffy_summers Do I get a gold star?
quentin_travers I understand that you're upset...
buffy_summers You understand *nothing*. You set that monster loose, and he came after my mother.
quentin_travers You think the test was unfair?
buffy_summers I think you better leave town before I get my strength back.
quentin_travers We're not in the business of fair, Miss Summers, we're fighting a war.
rupert_giles You're *waging* a war. She's fighting it. There is a difference.
quentin_travers Mr. Giles, if you don't mind...
rupert_giles The test is done. We're finished.
quentin_travers Not quite. She passed. You didn't. The Slayer is not the only one who must perform in this situation. I've recommended to the Council, and they've agreed, that you be relieved of your duties as Watcher immediately. You're fired.
rupert_giles On what grounds?
quentin_travers Your affection for your charge has rendered you incapable of clear and impartial judgment. You have a father's love for the child, and that is useless to the cause. It would be best if you had no further contact with the Slayer.
rupert_giles I'm not going anywhere.
quentin_travers No, well, I didn't expect you would adhere to that. However, if you interfere with the new Watcher, or countermand his authority in any way, you will be dealt with. Are we clear?
rupert_giles Oh, we're very clear.
quentin_travers Congratulations again.
buffy_summers Bite me.
quentin_travers Yes, well, colorful girl.
willow_rosenberg I can't believe Giles was fired. How could Giles get fired?
oz So, how did you manage to kill Kralik?
joyce_summers Oh, she was very clever.
joyce_summers Uh, you go ahead and tell it, dear. You tell it better.
willow_rosenberg Now, now when you say 'fired', do you mean 'fired'?
xander_harris You're not cruising past that concept any time soon, are you?
willow_rosenberg Well, it's just... I mean, he's been *fired*! He's, he's unemployed! He's... between jobs.
buffy_summers Giles isn't going anywhere, Will. He's still librarian.
willow_rosenberg Okay, but I'm writing an angry letter.
buffy_summers You know, nothing's really gonna change. The important thing is that I kept up my special birthday tradition of gut-wrenching misery and horror.
oz Bright side to everything.
buffy_summers Just feel better when I get my strength back.
xander_harris Give you a hand with that, little lady?
buffy_summers You're loving this far too much.
xander_harris Admit it. Sometimes you just need a big strong man.
xander_harris Uh, Will, gimme a hand with that?
