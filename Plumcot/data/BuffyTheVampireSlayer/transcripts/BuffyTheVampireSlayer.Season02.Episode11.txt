xander_harris You don't know what you're talking about.
willow_rosenberg Xander, he was obviously in charge.
xander_harris He was a puppet! She was using him!
willow_rosenberg He didn't seem like the type of guy who would let himself be used.
xander_harris Well, that was her genius! He didn't even know he was playing second fiddle. Buffy.
buffy_summers Huh?
xander_harris Who was the real power? The Captain, or Tennille?
buffy_summers Ummm... Who are these people?
xander_harris The Captain and Tennille? Boy, somebody was raised in a culture-free environment!
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I was just...
willow_rosenberg Thinking?
buffy_summers No, not thinking. Having a lot of happy non-thoughts. I love it when things are quiet around here.
xander_harris Yeah, with Spike and Drusilla out of the way, we've really been ridin' the mellow, and I am really jinxing the hell out of us by saying that.
buffy_summers Yeah, but we'll let you off this time.
willow_rosenberg So, we're pretty sure that there're not more Tarakan assassins coming our way?
buffy_summers Angel's sources say the contract's off.
xander_harris How *is* Angel? Pretend I care.
buffy_summers Getting better.
willow_rosenberg And you're loving playing nursemaid?
buffy_summers Oh, yeah!
xander_harris So, is it better than playing naughty stewardess?
buffy_summers Xander...
buffy_summers You guys wait here a second.
joyce_summers No!
buffy_summers Mom!
buffy_summers Oh, my... I'm sorry, I... I heard...
joyce_summers Uh, I-I-I broke a wineglass. Y-y-you're home early.
ted_buchanan Hi.
buffy_summers Hi.
joyce_summers Oh! Uh, this is my daughter, Buffy. Buffy, this is Ted.
ted_buchanan Okay, here we go!
buffy_summers So. All these late nights at the gallery recently I gather you were cataloging more than art.
joyce_summers Well, I... I've been looking for the right moment to introduce you two. He's a wonderful man.
ted_buchanan Sprinkle that on...
xander_harris Uh, a little more. Okay, more...
buffy_summers How'd you meet?
joyce_summers Oh, he sells, uh, computer software. He redid my entire system at the gallery, freed up a lot of my time.
buffy_summers To meet new people. And smooch them in my kitchen.
joyce_summers You weren't supposed to see that.
willow_rosenberg I like my new nine-Gig hard drive.
ted_buchanan But you don't love it, 'cause without the DMA upgrade your computer's only half a rocket ship.
willow_rosenberg Yeah, but who can afford the upgrades?
ted_buchanan Well, you can! I get the demos for free, I don't see why I shouldn't give 'em to you for the same price! Any friend of Buffy's...
ted_buchanan What?
xander_harris Oh, that's the sound she makes when she's speechless with geeker joy. Can I just say, this is the finest pizza *ever* on God's green Earth. What is your secret?
ted_buchanan Well, after you bake it, you fry it in herbs and olive oil, but you gotta use a cast-iron skillet. No room for compromise there.
xander_harris Y'know, you should market these things. I mean, you can get two, three hundred bucks apiece!
ted_buchanan Hungry?
buffy_summers No, thanks.
ted_buchanan Buffy, I want to apologize. That wasn't how I wanted us to meet. I wanted it to be... perfect. I'm very fond of your mother, I guess that's pretty obvious. I know you're the most important thing in her life, and, well, gosh, that makes you pretty important to me, too.
joyce_summers Buffy, I really want you to be okay with this.
ted_buchanan Beg to differ: *we* really want you to be okay with this.
buffy_summers I'm okay.
joyce_summers You are?
buffy_summers I am.
rupert_giles Buffy? I-I believe he's, he's, um...
rupert_giles It, it's, it's staking time, really. Don't you think?
buffy_summers Any others?
rupert_giles Well, for their sakes, I certainly hope not.
buffy_summers What? I kill vampires, that's my job.
rupert_giles Well, true, true, although you don't usually beat them into quite such a bloody pulp beforehand. Everything alright?
buffy_summers Yeah! Fine!
buffy_summers I killed a vampire here on Wednesday. Why are they hanging out at the park?
rupert_giles Well, they're... scattered, you know. Now their leaders are gone, with any luck dead. In times of crisis they usually return to the easiest feeding grounds.
buffy_summers Vampires are creeps.
rupert_giles Yes, that's why one slays them.
buffy_summers I mean, people are perfectly happy getting along, and then vampires come, and they run around and they kill people, and they take over your whole house, they start making these stupid little mini pizzas, and everyone's like, 'I like your mini pizzas,' but I'm telling you, I am...
rupert_giles Uh, uh, Buffy! I-I believe the... subtext here is, is, rapidly becoming, uh, uh, text. Are you sure there's nothing you want to share?
buffy_summers No. Forget it. Think there'll be any more? I-I can wait.
buffy_summers If you say one more word, things will become dire.
xander_harris Did you even bother to taste 'em? Nooo! Well, I did, and I'm here to tell ya those mini pizzas have changed my life! Ted is the master chef!
buffy_summers Fine! So he's a good cook. Well, what does that really tell you about a person?
xander_harris Everything.
willow_rosenberg You don't like him?
buffy_summers I don't *know* him. I, I mean, so far all I see is someone who apparently has a good job, seems nice and polite, and my mother really likes him.
xander_harris What kind of a monster is he?
buffy_summers I'm just saying there's something a little too clean about this clown.
willow_rosenberg He's a clean clown! I have my own fun.
xander_harris Buff, you're lacking evidence. I think maybe we're in Sigmund Freud territory.
willow_rosenberg He has a point. Separation anxiety, the mother figure being taken away, conflict with the father figure...
buffy_summers He's *not* my father figure.
xander_harris Having issues much?
buffy_summers I am not!
xander_harris You're having parental issues, you're having parental issues...
willow_rosenberg Xander...
xander_harris What? Freud would've said the exact same thing. Except he might not have done that little dance.
buffy_summers Okay, I admit it's weird. Seeing my mother frenching a guy is definitely a ticket to therapy land, but it's more than that. I'm pretty good at sensing what's going on around me, and there is definitely something wrong with this... Ted.
xander_harris Ted!
buffy_summers Of course, Ted. Who'd you think I was talking about?
xander_harris Hi, Ted! Ted, who's here.
ted_buchanan Hello, kids!
buffy_summers What are you doing here?
ted_buchanan I'm updating the software in the guidance office. Which reminds me, your upgrades.
willow_rosenberg Oh, what a day! Thank you!
ted_buchanan Think nothing of it. Buffy, do you like miniature golf?
xander_harris Who doesn't!
ted_buchanan Well, your mother and I were thinking maybe this Saturday we could drag the three of you out to the course, spend some time swinging the iron with the stuffy old people.
buffy_summers Well, uh...
ted_buchanan I'm making a picnic basket.
xander_harris With mini pizzas?
ted_buchanan And cookies!
buffy_summers You know what, we, we would love to, honestly, but, um, unfortunately we have that thing on Saturday.
willow_rosenberg Ohhh, that thing. That thing.
xander_harris Hey, we can do that thing anytime. I'm tired of doing that thing. We're on!
ted_buchanan Great!
rupert_giles Hello, Jenny.
jenny_calendar Rupert. Hi.
rupert_giles Some of your, uh, textbooks were delivered to the library. Um, do you want me to, uh, hang on to them?
jenny_calendar Yeah, that's fine. I'll send the kids by to pick 'em up.
rupert_giles Right. Good.
jenny_calendar Pretty flimsy excuse for coming by to see me.
rupert_giles You should have heard the ones I threw out. I just, I wanted to, uh... see how you were doing.
jenny_calendar I'm doing pretty good, actually. I've stayed out of mortal danger for three whole weeks. I could get used to it. I'm still having trouble sleeping, though.
rupert_giles Oh, of course. Um... you, you, you need time.
jenny_calendar Or possibly space. Rupert, I know you're concerned. But having you constantly poking around, making little puppy dog eyes at me, wondering if I'm okay... You make me feel bad that I don't feel better. I don't want that responsibility.
rupert_giles Sorry. I certainly don't mean to make, um, 'dog eyes'... at you. I'm just...
jenny_calendar Worried. I know.
rupert_giles I shouldn't have bothered you.
buffy_summers So mom's like, 'Do you think Ted will like this?' and 'This is Ted's favorite show,' and 'Ted's teaching me computers,' and 'Ted said the funniest thing,' and I'm like, 'That's really great, Mom,' and then she said I was being sarcastic, which I was, but I'm sorry if I don't wanna talk about Ted all the time.
angel So, you gonna talk about something else at some point?
buffy_summers I'm sorry. I just have so much to deal with, I don't need some new guy in my life.
angel No, but maybe your mom does.
buffy_summers Well, sure, if you're gonna use wisdom.
angel Loneliness is about the scariest thing there is.
buffy_summers Okay, so my mom needs a guy in her life. Does it have to be Ted?
angel Do you have somebody else in mind? There's a guy out there that would satisfy you?
buffy_summers My dad? Yeah, okay, that's not gonna happen. Fine, fine, I'll give Ted a chance. I'll play mini-golf, and I'll smile and curtsy and be the dutiful daughter. Do I have to like him?
angel Kiss me.
buffy_summers Finally, something I wanna do!
xander_harris Ah, the dreaded five-par cuckoo clock. Ha! So many have come, so few have conquered.
joyce_summers That picnic was delicious.
joyce_summers You know how rare it is to find a man that cooks?
ted_buchanan I know I've been looking a long time for one. So, Buffy, I bet the boys are lined up around the block tryin' to get a date with you.
buffy_summers Not really.
willow_rosenberg Oh, they are, but she's only interested in... uh, her studies! 'Book-cracker Buffy', it's kind of her nickname.
ted_buchanan Well, glad to hear it. I bet that means your grades will be picking up soon.
buffy_summers My grades? How does he know about my grades?
joyce_summers I told him. He wants to know everything about you. He's concerned. That's a good thing. Ooo, nice shot, Ted!
ted_buchanan Keep your eye on the ball. Watch those elbows!
ted_buchanan Oh! Bad luck, little lady!
joyce_summers Oh, we won't count it.
ted_buchanan We won't?
joyce_summers Well, it's just miniature golf.
ted_buchanan It is, but the rules are the rules. And what we teach her is what she takes out into the world when we're not there, whether it's at school or an unchaperoned party. I don't mean to overstep my bounds, this is between you and your mother, I just think right is right.
joyce_summers He has a point.
buffy_summers Fine. I'll just go hit my ball from the rough.
buffy_summers Hey, how 'bout that! Got a hole in two!
ted_buchanan Beg to differ.
buffy_summers Okay, so fine my score or whatever.
ted_buchanan I think you're missing the point here, little lady. Right is right, wrong is wrong. Why don't people see that?
buffy_summers It's just a game?
ted_buchanan Right, it's just a game, do your own thing, well, I'm not wired that way. And I am here to tell you it is *not* a game! It *does* count, and I don't stand for that kind of malarkey in my house!
buffy_summers Then I guess it's a good thing I'm not *in* your house.
ted_buchanan Do you want me to slap that smart-ass mouth of yours?
ted_buchanan Who's up for dessert? I made chocolate-chip cookies!
xander_harris Yum-my!
willow_rosenberg Cookies!
ted_buchanan Yeah! I-I made, uh, too many, so you guys are gonna have to take some home!
joyce_summers Mm! Buffy, you've got to try one of these! They're really good! Mm!
willow_rosenberg Mm!
xander_harris Mm! These are tasty!
joyce_summers Good morning, sunshine!
buffy_summers Hey.
joyce_summers I've got juice, I've got sticky buns, oh, don't they smell good!
joyce_summers Ted made them.
joyce_summers What?
buffy_summers I'd just like to eat something around here that Ted didn't make.
joyce_summers Oh, what kind of an attitude is that?
buffy_summers Look, Mom, I know you think he's great and all, but I...
joyce_summers Y'know, he went out of his way to be nice to you, and you couldn't say two words to him on Saturday. I do not expect you to love him right away like I do, but I do expect you to treat him decently.
buffy_summers You love him?
joyce_summers I-I don't know. That just slipped out. But I guess, I mean, it's not exactly like men beat down the door when you're a single...
buffy_summers When you're a single parent.
joyce_summers Honey, look. I wouldn't have anything to do with anybody if they didn't care about you. But he does! I don't understand why you can't see that!
buffy_summers He threatened me.
joyce_summers What?
buffy_summers He threatened me. He said that he was gonna slap my face.
joyce_summers He said no such thing! Honey, Ted told me what happened. He caught you cheating, didn't he?
buffy_summers Yeah, I kicked my ball in, put me in jail, but he totally wigged!
joyce_summers And he didn't say anything about it in front of the others, did he?
buffy_summers Uh, no, but I don't think that's the...
joyce_summers Well, I thought that that was pretty decent of him! Ted said we are just gonna have to give you time to come around. Oh, speaking of which, he's making dinner for us tonight, so I'd like you at home, please, promptly at six.
joyce_summers Mm, this is sooo delicious!
willow_rosenberg What do you mean, check him out?
buffy_summers I mean investigate him. Find out his secrets, hack into his life.
xander_harris Can you say 'overreaction'?
buffy_summers Can you say 'sucking chest wound'?
willow_rosenberg Buffy, it just seems like you *want* him to be corrupt, or something.
buffy_summers The guy lost his senses over mini-golf.
xander_harris So he's a little uptight. Last I heard that's not a slaying offense. Don't gimme the look, I'm on your side. I'm just saying there are some things in life you have to accept.
buffy_summers And I'm saying Ted ain't one of 'em.
xander_harris Hey, Cordy! Nice outfit.
cordelia_chase Oh, very funny.
xander_harris Not really.
cordelia_chase What are you saying?
xander_harris Nice outfit?
cordelia_chase Well, why don't you just keep your mouth shut!
xander_harris Would you guys excuse me for a sec?
willow_rosenberg What's up with them?
cordelia_chase What's wrong with you?
xander_harris I gave you a compliment.
cordelia_chase In front of your friends! They're gonna know!
xander_harris Know what?
cordelia_chase Please! It's too traumatic for me to even say it!
xander_harris That we kissed?
cordelia_chase Uhhh!
xander_harris Look, I'm not gonna tell, they're not gonna know. Not your friends, not my friends. You wanna go to the utility closet and make out?
cordelia_chase God! Is that all you ever think about? Okay.
buffy_summers Will, I'm not wrong here. Ted has a problem with me. He acts like I'm in the way or something. And Mom's been totally different since he's around.
willow_rosenberg Different, like happy?
buffy_summers Like Stepford. Will you help me?
willow_rosenberg You know I will. What do you want me to look for?
buffy_summers Let's start small. Can you find out where he works?
neal Yeah, i-i-it's a terrific product. No PC should be without it.
ted_buchanan No, Mrs. Lawnsdale, it is not an inexpensive piece of software. As a matter of fact it's a very expensive one. Which removes the risk of crashing your whole system. Of course, if you prefer something cheap, I can always recommend... Trust me, you won't be sorry. Thank *you* very much.
ted_buchanan Goin' to lunch!
neal You're new, aren't ya?
buffy_summers Oh...
neal I'm Neal.
buffy_summers I'm B... Linda. Belinda. I'm just temping for the day. Wow, that guy's a salesman. I guess he's the one to beat around here.
neal Nobody beats 'The Machine'. The guy's a genius. Knows everything about computers, never loses a client... If I sound bitter, I am.
buffy_summers Well, nobody likes an overachiever. Uh, he's probably got ex-wives and, and families to support.
neal He's just got a girlfriend. I'm amazed he let her clutter his desk.
neal Thank God he's taking off for the wedding.
buffy_summers The wedding?
neal Yeah, he's got it set for two months from now. Believe me, I am counting the days. Uh-oh, the ueber-boss. Back to the salt mines.
ted_buchanan We thank you for what we are about to receive, and we ask that you bless this house, and help the people in it to be more productive, more considerate and more honest. Amen.
joyce_summers Amen.
ted_buchanan Well, another great day at work! How was school today, Buffy? Did you learn anything?
buffy_summers Quite a bit.
ted_buchanan Good for you! Well, Joycie, what do you think?
joyce_summers I think every home should have one of you. It's fantastic! Don't you think?
buffy_summers Looks good.
ted_buchanan Well, you know, little lady, it's not just for looks, it's for building strong bodies.
joyce_summers Honey?
buffy_summers Are you two engaged?
joyce_summers Goodness, no! Whatever gave you that idea?
ted_buchanan Now, Joycie, let me handle this. Buffy, your mother and I are taking it one step at a time. And if things go the way I hope, maybe someday soon I just might ask her to tie the knot. How would you feel about that? It's okay to have feelings, Buffy, and it's okay to express them.
buffy_summers I'd feel like killing myself.
joyce_summers Buffy!
ted_buchanan No, no, I, I told her to be honest. Sweetheart, you should try and get used to me, 'cause you know what? I'm not going anywhere.
buffy_summers May I be excused?
joyce_summers You can go to your room, young lady, that's where you can go.
joyce_summers Ted, I I am so embarrassed! I-I-I don't know what's wrong with her!
ted_buchanan Joycie, you don't get to be salesman of the year by giving up after a couple of rejections. She'll come 'round.
buffy_summers Vampires... Here, vampires...
buffy_summers What are you doing in here?
ted_buchanan Your mother told you to go to your room, Buffy. You and I both know she didn't mean climb out a window and go gallivanting about town.
buffy_summers First of all, this is *my* room, second... You've been going through my things?
ted_buchanan Yes, I have.
buffy_summers That's my personal property! How *dare* you?!
ted_buchanan I don't see how it's any different from you snooping around my office, do you? What exactly is a Vampire Slayer?
buffy_summers It's none of your business.
ted_buchanan Beg to differ, little lady. Everything you do is nothing *but* my business from now on.
buffy_summers I think you better get out of here. Now!
ted_buchanan Or what? You'll slay me? I'm real. I'm not some goblin you made up in your little diary. Psychiatrists have a word for something like this: delusional. So, from now on, you'll do what I say, when I say, or I show this to your mother, and you'll spend your best dating years behind the wall of a mental institution. Your mother and I are going to be happy. You're not going to stand in the way. Sleep tight!
buffy_summers That's mine, and you are *not* leaving this room with it!
ted_buchanan Take your hand off me.
buffy_summers No.
buffy_summers Ohhh! I was *so* hoping you'd do that.
joyce_summers Buffy! Stop that!
joyce_summers Stop it!
joyce_summers Ted...
joyce_summers Ted! Ted!
joyce_summers You killed him!
detective_stein Ma'am, I'm Detective Stein. I'm sorry, but I need to ask you a few questions. Your relationship with the deceased?
joyce_summers We were, uh, seeing each other.
detective_stein Can you tell me what happened?
joyce_summers He fell. Down the stairs, he fell.
detective_stein I see. Uh, did he slip? Do you know what made him fall?
buffy_summers I hit him.
buffy_summers I hit him.
buffy_summers He was in my room. And we got into an argument.
detective_stein About what?
buffy_summers He, um...
detective_stein Was this the first time that you two had had an argument?
buffy_summers No. He threatened me. He, he said that he would slap me.
detective_stein That was tonight.
buffy_summers No. But he had my diary, and I-I tried to take it back, a-and that's when he hit me.
detective_stein Where?
detective_stein Well, it doesn't look like he hit you very hard.
buffy_summers I don't bruise easily.
detective_stein So you've been hit before?
buffy_summers Yes.
detective_stein But Ted never hit you.
buffy_summers I told you...
detective_stein Before tonight, Ted never hit you before tonight?
buffy_summers What do you want? I-I told you what happened, I didn't mean to!
detective_stein I believe you. Things get outta hand. He's a big guy.
joyce_summers Are you charging her with something?
detective_stein We're not bringing anything up against your daughter right now. She says Mr. Buchanan struck her, and if that's the case... Anyway, we've gotta examine it further. Right now I think you should just take her home, and the two of you should try and get some rest.
xander_harris Buffy!
xander_harris Are you okay?
willow_rosenberg How come you're here?
buffy_summers I couldn't stay at home. Mom won't even look at me.
willow_rosenberg What happened? Unless you don't want to talk about it.
buffy_summers We had a fight and I lost my temper. I really let him have it.
willow_rosenberg The paper said he fell.
buffy_summers He fell. Hard.
xander_harris What was he?
buffy_summers What?
xander_harris What was he? A-a demon? A giant bug? Some kind of dark god with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine? I mean, we are talking creature-feature here, right?
xander_harris Oh man!
willow_rosenberg But I'm sure it wasn't your fault. He started it.
buffy_summers Yeah. That defense only works in six-year-old court, Will.
xander_harris Court? Wa-wait. Are they charging you with something?
buffy_summers I-I don't know. Not yet.
buffy_summers He was a person, and I killed him.
willow_rosenberg Don't say that!
buffy_summers Why not? Everyone else is. And it's the truth.
xander_harris It was an accident.
buffy_summers I'm the Slayer. I had no right to hit him like that.
xander_harris Look, Buffy, I don't know what happened exactly. But I do know you. And I know you would never hurt anyone intentionally. Well, you know, unless...
buffy_summers Unless they were dating my mother?
buffy_summers I gotta go.
rupert_giles Buffy?
rupert_giles Are you alright?
rupert_giles Oh, uh, stupid question, I'm sorry. Look, i-i-if there's anything you need, of course, just, just ask.
buffy_summers What's going on?
rupert_giles Oh, you needn't worry about that. They're just asking a few questions, your, your, your behavior and... um... uh...
rupert_giles Of course, I told them you, uh... I...
xander_harris Man, this is killing me! That bastard was up to something, I know it. If I could just get my hands on him...
xander_harris Earlier this week.
cordelia_chase I thought you liked him.
xander_harris I sometimes like things that are not good for me. Besides, no way, no how does Buffy put the big hurt on an innocent man. Nice Uncle Ted was dirty.
willow_rosenberg We've gotta prove that somehow. Xander, do you have a pen?
xander_harris If Buffy has to go to jail because of that creep I'm gonna lose it. He's gotta be in there, Will. Uh, history of domestic violence, a criminal record? Ooo! Cookies!
cordelia_chase I don't get it. Buffy's the Slayer. Shouldn't she have...
xander_harris What, a license to kill?
cordelia_chase Well, not for fun. But she's like this superman. Shouldn't there be different rules for her?
willow_rosenberg Sure, in a fascist society.
cordelia_chase Right! Why can't we have one of those?
willow_rosenberg Buffy's not going to jail. It's not fair.
rupert_giles Whatever the authorities have planned for her, it can't be much worse than what she's doing to herself. She's taken a human life. The guilt, it-it's, it's pretty hard to bear, and it won't go away soon.
cordelia_chase I guess you should know, since you helped raise that demon that killed that guy that time?
rupert_giles Yes. Do let's bring that up as often as possible.
xander_harris So, Giles, you takin' over tonight?
rupert_giles Um, well, Buffy's not in any shape to patrol. The least I can do is pick up the slack. Someone has to.
willow_rosenberg Giles, you shouldn't go out there without the Slayer.
rupert_giles Until Buffy regains her equilibrium, there *is* no Slayer.
cordelia_chase If you need help...
rupert_giles No, uh, Buffy needs your help more than I. You carry on investigating, see if you can find out as much about this Buchanan chap as possible.
willow_rosenberg Be careful.
rupert_giles I-I will.
willow_rosenberg Ted's got no criminal record! Damn! This guy's like citizen of the year!
xander_harris Don't sweat it. It'll be fine.
willow_rosenberg Don't sweat it?
xander_harris Yeah, cute buddy! We'll work it out! No worries!
cordelia_chase What happened to 'this is killing me'?
xander_harris Worrying isn't gonna solve any problems.
buffy_summers Can I help?
joyce_summers It's done. I've been meaning to clean out this junk for months. Do you, uh, have homework?
buffy_summers I didn't mean to hurt him.
joyce_summers I don't wanna talk about this.
buffy_summers Mom, please, you have to know...
joyce_summers I can't, not yet. Please, Buffy, just go to your room.
willow_rosenberg Okay!
xander_harris What do we know?
willow_rosenberg Well, apparently the secret ingredient is not love.
xander_harris What is it then?
willow_rosenberg I'm not positive, but I think it's Dematorin. It's like a tranquilizer, keeps you all mellow and compliant. It also shares a few components with Ecstasy.
xander_harris This is evidence! This is real evidence that Ted was some kind of a crook! Buffy's cleared! Willow, you are the best human ever! I adore you!
xander_harris Well, that's the cookies talkin', but you rock!
cordelia_chase Well, your search finally hit pay dirt. You got some personal records, marriage certificates and an address.
xander_harris Well, let's check it out, get our Slayer back on her feet before somebody else gets hurt.
rupert_giles Ah!
jenny_calendar Yeah, I get that reaction from men all the time.
rupert_giles Jenny! What are you doing here?
jenny_calendar I saw your car back there. I wanted to apologize.
rupert_giles Well, now is... not the best time to go ta...
jenny_calendar No, no, please, please, lemme just, lemme get this out. I was sooo... harsh the other day. I am so sorry. I mean, I know how badly you must feel about putting me in danger before, and...
rupert_giles Right in harm's view now.
buffy_summers Mom? The hell with this.
buffy_summers She nailed it shut. Well, it's official, this day can't get any worse.
ted_buchanan Beg to differ.
buffy_summers You died.
ted_buchanan That's right, little lady, you killed me. Do we have something to say about that? Are we sorry?
buffy_summers What are you?
ted_buchanan I'm a salesman! That's what you should've remembered. No matter how you put him down...
ted_buchanan ...a good salesman always bounces back!
rupert_giles MY BAG!
ted_buchanan You see I had to shut down for a while to get you off my back. You should've seen the intern's face when I got up off the table, it was a hoot! Fun's over, though.
jenny_calendar Say good night, big guy!
rupert_giles AHHH!
jenny_calendar OH, GOD!
jenny_calendar Oh, no!
vampire Nice shot, lady!
ted_buchanan That wasn't playing fair, missy!
ted_buchanan You're gonna find...
ted_buchanan Hell of a day! Makes you feel like you're eighteen again! ...that I don't like being disobeyed!
ted_buchanan Don't worry about me and your mother. We're gonna be very happy!
willow_rosenberg Careful!
xander_harris Let's look around.
cordelia_chase I'll take the back.
xander_harris Check for cookies.
xander_harris For evidence!
willow_rosenberg So far I've counted four marriage certificates.
xander_harris Any divorce papers?
willow_rosenberg Not a one.
xander_harris So either our boy was a Mormon, or...
willow_rosenberg Whoa, whoa, 1957! Ted musta married young! Like pre-school young.
cordelia_chase Nothing interesting back here. Doesn't look like anybody's worked here, let alone lived here.
xander_harris Something's missing here. This doesn't seem like Ted at all.
cordelia_chase Yeah, and this rug? It doesn't go with the rest of the decor.
joyce_summers Oh. Buffy, I'm sorry... I know you didn't mean to...
ted_buchanan Joyce?
joyce_summers Ted! Is it really you? But you were...
ted_buchanan I'm okay! I'm okay.
joyce_summers I-I don't understand this! You were dead!
ted_buchanan They said I must've been dead for six minutes. They said any longer and it would've caused brain damage.
joyce_summers Oh, why didn't they tell us?
ted_buchanan Nobody knew! They took me to the morgue. I was unconscious for almost a day. An intern found me. It's a miracle, Joyce. A miracle.
joyce_summers Oh, Ted!
ted_buchanan I know.
joyce_summers Oh, my God, Buffy! Oh, Ted, I swear... she never meant to hurt you. You have to believe me.
ted_buchanan You don't have to worry about Buffy. You don't have to worry about anything. Daddy's here.
cordelia_chase Feels like home. If it's the fifties and you're a psycho.
xander_harris Whatcha got in the closet, Ted?
xander_harris Let's go.
cordelia_chase But we need evidence!
xander_harris We got it.
willow_rosenberg What's in there?
xander_harris His first four wives.
ted_buchanan You know what brought me back, Joyce? It was you. I couldn't go into that light. I had to come back for you. I'm gonna make you so happy!
joyce_summers You should sit down.
ted_buchanan I feel fine! Never better!
joyce_summers Ted, I think I should talk to Buffy first. Before she sees you, 'cause I'm sure she's...
ted_buchanan Do we have to worry about Buffy right now? How about worrying about Teddy? He's the one who died!
joyce_summers I-I-I'm, I'm sorry, I just... I... I-I don't know what to do!
ted_buchanan Don't I always tell you what to do? I'm going to make things right. Then you and I... Want a little gravy with that? ...can go away where no one will bother us again.
joyce_summers Ted, I, I think you might wanna rest for awhile.
ted_buchanan I think you might wanna stop telling me what to do! I don't take orders from women! I'm not wired that way!
jenny_calendar Oh, God, I am so sorry!
rupert_giles I think I'm alright.
jenny_calendar No, you're just in shock.
rupert_giles No, no, really, I, uh, I don't think it went in too deep. The... advantages of layers of tweed. Better than kevlar.
jenny_calendar Oh, okay, alright, we have to get you to the hospital.
rupert_giles Yes, yes.
jenny_calendar C'mon.
rupert_giles Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh!
jenny_calendar Sorry! Sorry!
rupert_giles Let's move slowly, shall we?
jenny_calendar Sorry! Okay...
jenny_calendar Okay...
rupert_giles What? Wha-what is it?
jenny_calendar Some night, huh? Yeah, you really know how to woo a girl back, don't cha?
rupert_giles Ow! Ow!
jenny_calendar Hospital.
rupert_giles Yes.
joyce_summers I-I think I could use a drink. Um, to-to-to celebrate!
ted_buchanan We should probably be hitting the road.
joyce_summers Hitting the road?
ted_buchanan You're going to love the house. It's furnished just the way you like it. I spent a lot of... ...telling me what to do! ...time decorating.
joyce_summers Well, then I'd, I'd probably better go pack.
ted_buchanan I already have your clothes. They're your size, they're always your size. You left me once, but I keep bringing you back. Husband and wife is forever. Forever.
ted_buchanan Let's go.
joyce_summers Ted, let go, please. Get off me!
ted_buchanan Fine then. I'll have to carry you.
ted_buchanan Buffy, come out! I don't stand for this kind of malarkey in my house!
buffy_summers Uncle Teddy?
buffy_summers This house is mine!
ted_buchanan Buffy? How about a nice game of Parcheesi?
joyce_summers Do you wanna rent a movie tonight?
buffy_summers Sounds like fun.
joyce_summers Just nothing with horror in it. Or romance. Or men.
buffy_summers I guess we're 'Thelma and Louise'ing it again.
joyce_summers Mm-hm. Good call. I still think he's gonna jump out at me. Especially after what the police found in his house. It's just too horrible.
buffy_summers I wouldn't worry. He's not coming back.
joyce_summers I wish I could be so sure.
buffy_summers Trust me. He's on the scrap heap. Of life.
xander_harris So, I'm Ted, the sickly loser. I'm dying and my wife dumps me. I build a better Ted. He brings her back, holds her hostage in his bunker'o'love until she dies. And then he keeps bringing her back, over and over. Now, now that's creepy on a level I hardly knew existed.
willow_rosenberg The sad part is the real Ted must've been a genius. There were design features in that robot that pre-date...
buffy_summers Willow, tell me you didn't keep any parts.
willow_rosenberg Not any big ones.
buffy_summers Oh, Will, you're supposed to use your powers for good!
willow_rosenberg I just wanna learn stuff.
cordelia_chase Like how to build your own serial killer?
xander_harris Uh, it's so hard to rent one nowadays.
cordelia_chase Can we just drop the subject?
buffy_summers Absolutely. I plan to forget the whole thing and pick up right where we left off.
buffy_summers Okay! That's it! I give up! Do I have to sound an air horn every time I walk into a room?
buffy_summers I mean, what is it with grownups these days?
