MONK#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode11 We had to hide the key ... made it human and sent it to you.
buffy_summers Dawn.
DOCTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode11 OK, your mom's in recovery.
buffy_summers Is she all right?
DOCTOR#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode11 I think your mother's gonna be fine.
spike I wanna show you something.
riley_finn Harder.
riley_finn Buffy.
buffy_summers I've given you everything that I have, my heart, my body and soul!
riley_finn I just don't feel it. They want me back, Buffy. The military.
riley_finn I'm leaving tonight.
buffy_summers Riley!
xander_harris You ever have that feeling where there's something you know you're supposed to do and you forgot what it was?
anya Nope.
xander_harris I've been having that feeling, I just realized what it was. Like three weeks ago Riley asked me to borrow a crescent wrench. I keep having this feeling like I'm supposed to give it to him.
anya Well, that's not going to happen unless he comes back. You know, not to get the crescent wrench. Just to come back.
xander_harris I just mean, sometimes I sort of forget that he's gone. It's like, where's Riley? Oh wait, the central republic of Where-in-the-hell.
anya Xander?
anya If you ever decide to go, I want a warning. You know, big flashing red lights, and-and-and one of those clocks that counts down like a bomb in a movie? And there's a whole bunch of, of colored wires, and I'm not sure which is the right one to cut, but I guess the green one, and then at the last second No! The red one! and then click, it stops with three-tenths of a second left, but then you don't leave. Like that, okay?
xander_harris Check. Big bomb clock. Come here.
anya Maybe it's her.
xander_harris Huh?
anya Well, maybe it won't happen to us because it's all about *her* messing things up. She couldn't make it work with Angel, and then she let Riley go away.
xander_harris Yeah, relationship debris is kind of piling up on the Buffy highway.
anya Hmm. Humans make the same mistakes over and over. I saw it when I was a vengeance demon. Some guy dumps a girl, she calls me, I exact vengeance, blah blah blah, the next year, same girl, different guy. I mean, after you smite a few of 'em you start going my goodness, young lady ... maybe you're doing something wrong here too.
xander_harris I don't think it's a pattern with her. No, it's just ... you know, now that it happened again ... man number two ... I wonder how she's dealing with it.
young_nun What, what, what was that, he looked like a, a demon!
buffy_summers Yeah, he did. Are you okay?
young_nun Yeah, I think so.
buffy_summers Here.
buffy_summers So, um, a-about being a nun... you know, um, with the whole ... abjuring the company of men ... you know, how's that working for you? The... abjuring.
young_nun Um ... good.
buffy_summers Yeah, do you, do you have to be like super-religious?
young_nun Well, uh...
buffy_summers How's the food?
rupert_giles All right. Switch. Left lead.
buffy_summers So you really think they might be able to help us?
rupert_giles Uh, if you mean are they gonna help us find out something about Glory ... I saw that coming. You're dropping your shoulder. Uh, the resources that the ... Watchers Council has at their disposal, I mean the Central Library alone is just...
buffy_summers Don't talk about the books again. You get all ... and sometimes there's drool.
rupert_giles I'm sorry, but we, we've really exhausted the materials I have here, and we're coming up empty. You're, you're still dropping your shoulder. I can see when you're gonna go with your right. You're doing it again!
rupert_giles Ow!
buffy_summers Sorry! Sorry. So, Glory's all you're gonna talk to them about, right?
rupert_giles Let's, let's take a break.
buffy_summers Answer me.
rupert_giles I, I'm not gonna mention Dawn's name. I wouldn't do that, I promise.
buffy_summers But you're gonna tell them about the key? That Glory's looking for something called the key?
rupert_giles Well, knowing her goal is, is crucial. I mean, i-i-if anything helps them uncover her origins, her, her plans...
buffy_summers I know. It's just I trust these Watchers about as far as ... you could throw them.
rupert_giles Thank you very much.
buffy_summers I'm just freaked about the idea of giving them any information that could possibly lead them to Dawn.
rupert_giles Truly, Buffy, if I saw an alternative ... if, if the Initiative were still around, I'd consider using them, but... they're gone, and then Riley was, was, uh, the last link we had to the government.
rupert_giles Sorry, I didn't mean to....
buffy_summers It's okay. You can say his name. I'm doing all right. These things happen. People break up and they move on ... for a while it feels like the end of the world, you know, but ... big picture...
rupert_giles Not so huge.
buffy_summers Not so huge? I just said it feels like the end of the world, don't you listen?
buffy_summers I'm teasing.
rupert_giles Oh.
buffy_summers Sort of. I'll be okay.
rupert_giles Well, I do hate to go if you're feeling badly.
buffy_summers look, if it help you find out something about Glory, I'm thrilled to have you gone.
anya You're going away for a *week*? That's great!
rupert_giles Yes, yes, everybody seems delighted about it.
anya Well, I get to run the store, right?
rupert_giles You? Ah, w-well, it's quite a lot for one person to take care of. Well, I-I mean, the trash men, for example, I mean, they, they, they've been making such a mess in the back alley, the recycling people can't get in there to collect. Well, somebody has to talk to them.
anya I can take care of that.
tara_maclay I'm envious, Mr. Giles. A trip to England sounds so exciting and exotic. Un...less you're English.
buffy_summers Look, don't worry about the shop. We'll take care of it. We can open and close, and, and we'll deal with everyone.
willow_rosenberg We can come by between classes! Usually I use that time to copy over my class notes with a system of different colored pens ... but it's been pointed out to me that that's, you know, insane.
tara_maclay I said quirky.
anya Hello, I work here! I'll take care of everything.
xander_harris Yeah, Anya can do it!
anya Thanks, sweetie. Well said.
rupert_giles Um, Anya, while, while I completely trust you uh, uh, to take care of the inventory and the money, um ... dealing with people requires a certain, uh ... finesse.
anya I have finesse! I have finesse coming out of my bottom! I can completely lie to the health inspector. I can, you know, distract him with coy smiles, and, and bribe him with money and goods.
xander_harris See there? She'll be great.
willow_rosenberg Don't worry, Giles. I'll help her take care of everything. It'll be ship-shape. Better, it'll be shop-shape.
anya Xander, she's talking to Giles like I'm not here. Make her stop.
rupert_giles Perhaps I'd better call the airline...
willow_rosenberg I'm just trying to help out! Xander, tell her.
rupert_giles ...schedule an earlier flight back, excuse me.
anya Tell her that I don't need her help.
xander_harris So, how goes the slaying?
buffy_summers I killed something in a convent last night.
xander_harris In any other room, a frightening declaration. Here, a welcome distraction. Tell us all about the killing, Buff.
buffy_summers Pretty standard. Vampire staking. Ooh! But I met a nun, and she let me try on her wimple.
xander_harris Okay, now we're back to frightening.
buffy_summers You!
buffy_summers You with the actual clothing, who are you? Dawn, come look at this.
joyce_summers It's hard to recognize me, huh?
dawn_summers Whoa.
buffy_summers No more bathrobe.
joyce_summers Hmm. I looked at it today, and there it was, all fuzzy and blue, and I just couldn't stand it any more.
buffy_summers I don't think the rest of us will miss it much either.
dawn_summers It was getting a little ripe, Mom.
buffy_summers Maybe we should burn it.
dawn_summers It would keep the bugs away.
joyce_summers It doesn't smell! Fine, fine, make your funny jokes at the expense of the woman with the hole in her skull.
buffy_summers Let's go. I think we've tired her out.
dawn_summers Whatcha doin'?
buffy_summers Playing soccer.
dawn_summers Can I hang out in here?
buffy_summers Don't touch anything.
dawn_summers You took down his pictures.
buffy_summers Yeah.
dawn_summers I ... I think I would've done that sooner. Like, boom! Don't wanna see that face again.
buffy_summers It wasn't like that. I was never angry with him. Okay, that's a lie. But it's not like I don't want to see his face.
dawn_summers I was just starting to kinda like the guy, and then ... gone. So fast.
buffy_summers It wasn't really so fast. Him leaving. According to everyone who isn't me, it was kind of gradual.
dawn_summers Oh. Does that make it any better?
buffy_summers No.
dawn_summers Because you should have noticed earlier?
buffy_summers Stop being insightful. It's creepy. It hurts. In all kinds of horrible ways. In the way where I'm furious at him ... in the way where I blame myself ... and all the little ways I imagine ... how I could have fixed things.
dawn_summers It'll get better. Won't it?
buffy_summers I hope so. Yes. It has to. I'll just keep going like I have been, and every day it'll get a little bit better.
dawn_summers Really? Every day?
buffy_summers Not really. But it'll be better soon.
dawn_summers It still feels all sudden to me. With him gone where no one can talk to him.
buffy_summers But you never know. Maybe he'll come back. Maybe he'll hate the jungle ... or maybe he'll want to give it another try. I could ... say all the things I didn't get to say.
spike Um ... there's something I got to tell you. About showing you Riley in that place. I didn't mean to ... Anyway, I know you're feeling all betrayed - by him, not me. I was trying to help, you know. Not like I made him be there, after all. Actually trying to help you. Best intentions.
spike I mean, you know, pretty state you'd be in, thinking things are all right while he's toddling halfway round the bend. Oh, I'll insult him if I want to! I'm the one who's on your side! Me! Doing you a favor! And you, being dead petty about it - me, getting nothing but your hatred and your venom and - you ungrateful bitch!
spike Bitch!
spike Buffy ... there's something I wanted to tell you.
willow_rosenberg Good, and, and hellebore. It's up and to the right.
tara_maclay Hellebore, one of my favorites.
willow_rosenberg It's powerful stuff. I tried to use it to de-rat Amy, and it didn't work. But I think it might have made her really smart. She keeps giving me these looks like she's planning something. Rubbing her paws together.
anya Hey. What are you two doing?
willow_rosenberg Oh, we're gonna try out a few spells.
tara_maclay There's this thing you can do where you create light, and we thought, what if you could make, like, simulated sunlight?
willow_rosenberg Yeah, so then, you know, there Buffy is, middle of the night, and she finds this whole nest of vamps, a-and then she just goes, Presto!
tara_maclay Only it won't be presto exactly.
willow_rosenberg And, and voom! There's a, a floating ball of sunlight. Vamps get dusty.
tara_maclay You don't wanna look right at it, though.
anya That's swell, but you can't use this stuff. Giles has only been gone two days and you're already causing trouble. You shouldn't do things while he's gone.
willow_rosenberg You're the fish!
anya What?
willow_rosenberg The, the fish in the bowl, in
anya What are you talking about?
tara_maclay It's a book. This cat does all this mischief.
willow_rosenberg It's so cute. He balances a bunch of stuff, including that fish in the bowl! A-and, but don't try it for real when you're six, because then you're not allowed to have fish for five years.
anya You're referencing literature I have no way to be familiar with. You're trying to make me feel left out, and you're stealing!
willow_rosenberg I'm not stealing. I-I'm just taking things without paying for th... In what twisted dictionary is that stealing?
tara_maclay Willow, maybe we should just pay.
willow_rosenberg Anya, Giles would be totally fine with this. Come on, it'll be fun. We could show you how to do some stuff! You could be floatin' pencils by the end of the day.
anya Sometimes I miss having powers. Oh. Oh! I know what this is! This is peer pressure! Any second now you're gonna make me smoke tobacco and, and have drugs.
willow_rosenberg Look how easy.
anya Hey! Don't float the merchandise!
anya Stop that!
xander_harris Hey, look at this, my two favorite girls! Three favorite girls.
anya Xander, Willow's stealing. She's a burglar.
willow_rosenberg Right, the cunning, broad daylight in front of everyone burglar. Xander, I'm just doing a spell to help Buffy.
anya Xander, Giles left me in charge. Tell her.
xander_harris Hey, hey, Judge Xander requesting a recess here.
tara_maclay You really shouldn't pull him into this.
xander_harris Yeah, see? Tara's with me. Protect me, Tara.
willow_rosenberg Xander, what I'm doing, it's a good thing. And if it doesn't work, Giles never even needs to know about it.
willow_rosenberg Oops.
anya The cash register! What did you do with the cash register? Dear god!
willow_rosenberg I'll fix it, I'll fix it!
._#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode11
willow_rosenberg There, all back. Good as new.
anya Money. Did you hurt the money? comes out) Money good? She endangered the money!
willow_rosenberg Of course, that's what she cares about. I like money better than people. People can so rarely be exchanged for goods and/or services.
anya Xander, she's pretending to be me!
willow_rosenberg Well, can you even believe how she's acting?
xander_harris Okay, you know what? I'm tired of being the one in the middle. I'm not gonna let you pull me into this.
willow_rosenberg I'm not.
xander_harris Whatever the issue is between you two, just figure it out without me.
anya Xander, don't go!
willow_rosenberg You made him mad.
anya Me?!
willow_rosenberg Tara, who do you think he was more mad at?
tara_maclay Um, you know? I think, uh, maybe, maybe you guys have some stuff you need to work out, you know, just really ... talk.
willow_rosenberg Fleabane...
anya Fifteen cents.
willow_rosenberg Salamander eyes...
anya Ten bucks for twelve. Bargain.
willow_rosenberg Bindweed.
anya Ugh, ooh, that's a pricey one.
willow_rosenberg Would you stop that? It's very distracting.
anya Fine. Make your little ball of sunshine. I'll be quiet.
willow_rosenberg Good, because this spell is very sensitive. Once I begin, any non-ritual word can disrupt it.
anya Fine.
willow_rosenberg Okay, here we go.
anya Did you start yet?
willow_rosenberg Shh, no! This is it.
willow_rosenberg Spirits of light, I invoke thee. Let the gloom of darkness part before you.
willow_rosenberg Let the moonlight be made pale by your presence. Spirits-
anya Is it done?
willow_rosenberg Shh!!!
willow_rosenberg Spirits of light, grant my wishes.
anya Sorry, I thought you were done.
willow_rosenberg Do you *wanna* screw this up?
anya No. No. I'm sure you can do that all on your own.
willow_rosenberg Hey Anya, whatever really has you mad, why don't you just say it, like you do every other thought that stomps through your brain?
anya I believe I have said it.
willow_rosenberg No. You haven't. Come on. Let it out!
willow_rosenberg He's not a ball of sunshine.
buffy_summers New semester, new classes. Whole new vistas of knowledge to be confused and intimidated by.
tara_maclay I think this one's gonna be kind of fun. Greek Art's gonna touch on so many things mythology, history, philosophy...
buffy_summers The professor spit too much when he talked. It was like being at Sea World. The first five rows will get wet.
tara_maclay That was just, you know, um, enthusiasm.
buffy_summers It seemed very much like saliva.
tara_maclay We'll sit farther back next time.
buffy_summers Good plan. I need to keep this course. The only other thing that fits into my schedule is Central American Geopolitics.
tara_maclay Hmm.
buffy_summers And no, thank you. I even hear the word jungle, all I can think of is him. You know, is that the one Riley's in? Really don't need a daily 2:00 knife in the heart.
tara_maclay Is it that bad?
buffy_summers Sort of. But I'm starting to get perspective on the whole situation. You know, maybe Riley's ... where he's supposed to be. You know, maybe he needed ... to be where he was needed.
tara_maclay Willow says that things always happen for a reason.
buffy_summers But you ever notice people only say that about bad things? But not for me the furrowed brow. What do you say we go pick up Willow and indulge ourselves in a little after-school hamburger?
tara_maclay I guess we could. She might still be at the magic shop. I was there earlier, and she and Anya kinda got in this little squabble ... Xander and I sort of cleared out, he was pretty upset.
buffy_summers Anya and, and Xander are in trouble?
tara_maclay Oh! No, I-I said that all wrong. It was nothing. Willow and Anya were sort of fighting, and then Xander kind of snapped at both of them and he left.
buffy_summers He left? Xander left Anya?
tara_maclay Ummm ... no, not left her left her, he just left. It was only a little thing, it-
buffy_summers Little thing? See, the thing is, the ... little things get bigger, you know, and, and, and, and, if you don't catch the little thing and then, boom! You have this, this, this whole huge thing!
tara_maclay Oh dear.
buffy_summers Not, not, not them with the little things! They can't break up!
tara_maclay Oh, I think-
buffy_summers They have a beautiful love.
tara_maclay I think they'll be fine.
buffy_summers They have a miraculous love!
tara_maclay What?
buffy_summers A miraculous love!
anya There, that parked car! We're still on his trail.
willow_rosenberg I don't even get how we made that guy, because, wow, advanced!
anya No one made him. He must have been trapped in that crystal, and you released him.
willow_rosenberg *I* released him? No, this was definitely a we thing. Or, or a you thing! I-it definite feels like a you thing.
anya Look, just find the reversal spell. And hurry! Look what he did to that lamppost!
willow_rosenberg I'm trying. Put the top up, the pages are all blowy!
anya Well, I don't know how to put the top up, I only just figured out what the left pedal does. It makes us stop!
willow_rosenberg You don't know how to drive? Why didn't you say you don't know how to drive?
anya Well, I couldn't know if I could until I tried, could I?
willow_rosenberg This is very, very bad. There, there's an ogre on the loose-
anya Troll.
willow_rosenberg What?
anya Troll on the loose. Now hold on, I'm gonna press the right pedal harder. I expect us to accelerate.
willow_rosenberg There's a troll on the loose, and you're gonna crash Giles' car!
anya It's likely. We're going very fast. You should have listened to me and not done the spell. Giles put me in charge.
willow_rosenberg Giles can be an idiot. The smart kind, but still.
anya Xander agreed.
willow_rosenberg Oh, right. Xander doesn't step out of line.
anya Well, what do you mean by that?
willow_rosenberg Nothing.
anya Find that spell quickly!
willow_rosenberg Whoa, that's gone.
spike Hey, watch it. Oh, it's you.
xander_harris Spike, don't let me stop you from not being here.
spike I was here first, you know.
xander_harris Uh-huh. Go away.
spike Now why would I do that, when it's bugging you so much having me here?
spike They have chicken wings too. Also a sort of a flower-shaped thing they make from an onion. It's brilliant.
xander_harris Are you talking to me hoping that I'll get so depressed that I'll impale myself on a fork right in front of you?
spike Lovely thought. If I don't hurt you myself, the chip wouldn't zap me. I could eat you that way. Beat the onion thing all to hell.
xander_harris Hey! Those are mine.
spike My, my. Someone's in a temper. This all sympathetic misery borrowed from the Slayer?
xander_harris What? No, nothing to do with Buffy.
spike So she's all right then. Not, uh ... holding grudges.
xander_harris What are you talking about? What does Buffy have to do with anything? What grudges?
spike Oh, yeah. Okay. No need to talk about her then. I'm sure she's merrily slaying some pals of mine, having a grand old time.
buffy_summers This is very bad.
buffy_summers Willow? Anya?
tara_maclay They're not back there either, they're gone. Buffy, something's been here and Willow's gone.
buffy_summers Don't worry. We'll get her back, I promise. Come on, this thing's probably leaving a huge trail.
olaf Puny receptacle!
olaf Rrrah! You do well to flee, townspeople! I will pillage your lands and dwellings! I will burn your crops and make merry sport with your more attractive daughters! Ha ha ha! Mark my words!
olaf Ooh! Ale! I smell delicious ale!
xander_harris And they get in these fights, and they're both looking at me like I'm the referee. Also, sometimes I'll say something about Anya, and Willow'll get this look, this, um, what the hell do you see in her look.
spike I know that look. Lot of people never really got Dru, you know.
xander_harris Well, she was insane. Then it's like, well, I get all torn. Because, Willow's my best friend and I really value her opinion, but, uh, Anya's my girlfriend, you know?
spike Hmm. What does the Slayer think of all this ... friction in the ranks? Can't be good for morale.
xander_harris I don't know.
spike She's a little ... preoccupied, maybe. It's understandable what with all the upset, all the blaming of innocent bystanders who got caught up in the mess.
xander_harris What?
spike I mean, did she *want* to be made a fool of? And, what does a person have to do to make it right? Hey, watch it, mate.
spike On second thought, do what you like.
olaf Ale! Yes!
olaf Ah, fragrant ale!
xander_harris So, uh ... think I should run and get Buffy?
olaf Barmaid! Bring me stronger ale, and some plump, succulent babies to eat.
xander_harris I'm gonna run and get Buffy. Or maybe you could fight him.
spike Yeah, I could do that, but I'm paralyzed with not caring very much.
olaf You there! Do you know where there are babies?
spike What do you think, the hospital?
xander_harris What? Shut up! Um ... listen...
olaf I find myself very hungry. And when I'm hungry I grow short of patience.
xander_harris Well, we can take care of the hungry, so how's about you just sit down in one of the ... sturdier chairs, and we can ... have a calm talk and something to eat.
olaf Can it be babies?
xander_harris Well, not so much.
olaf Oh.
xander_harris But maybe ... some roast pigs, and ... stags, and ... much hearty grog.
spike They've got this onion thing...
olaf You cannot appease me! Do not try! More ale!
anya Xander! You shouldn't be here. There's a troll.
xander_harris Uh, a big guy? Hammer? I think I noticed him.
willow_rosenberg I wish Buffy was here.
buffy_summers I'm here.
willow_rosenberg I wish I had a million dollars. Just checking.
buffy_summers What's going on? Where did he come from?
spike Hello, Buffy.
anya Willow stole ingredients and released him from a purple crystal. He's a troll.
buffy_summers You did this?
willow_rosenberg Me? No, we. I mean, us. Uh, her. It's very complex.
anya Well, we can stop him. Willow, do the spell.
willow_rosenberg Uh, let the conjuring be-
olaf Stop!
willow_rosenberg Nobody lets me finish!
olaf You ... told the witch to do that, Anyanka. You seem determined to put an end to all my fun. Just like you always did when we were dating!
anya Uh, um...
xander_harris You dated him?
buffy_summers You dated a troll?
willow_rosenberg And we're what, surprised by this?
anya Well, he wasn't a troll then! You know, he was just a big dumb guy, and ... well, you know, he cheated on me and I made him into a troll, which by the way is... how I got the ... job as a vengeance demon.
olaf I did not cheat! Not in my heart. It was only one wench! I, I had had a great deal of mead! Next thing I know, I'm a troll! Ohh ... ohh ... you did this, Anyanka. You will die for this.
xander_harris But, but, you seem to enjoy the, the being a troll.
olaf I adjusted. And then what happened? Witches. Filthy, dirty, disgusting witches. They trapped me. I was imprisoned in that crystal for centuries. Ohh, a curse on all witches! All must die!
buffy_summers Willow, again.
willow_rosenberg Uh, uh, Let the conjuring be undone. Return the beast to native form.
olaf comes toward them) Witch, you must stop!
willow_rosenberg Keep it far from us and ours as long as my voice shall sound.
olaf It did not work!
willow_rosenberg Okay, wait! Uh, Let the conjuring-
buffy_summers Where is he?
willow_rosenberg Gone.
buffy_summers Xander, follow him. Anya, Willow, head back to the magic shop, find a spell that will actually stop him.
buffy_summers What are you doing?
spike Making this woman more comfortable. I'm not sampling, I'll have you know. Just look at all these lovely blood-covered people. I could, but not a taste for Spike, not a lick. Know you wouldn't like it.
buffy_summers You want credit for not feeding on bleeding disaster victims?
spike Well, yeah.
buffy_summers You're disgusting.
spike What's it take?
willow_rosenberg Hurry up! I'm taking everything on relocation spells, suspension spells, and, what the heck, spells to make him really sleepy, 'cause, slightly better.
anya In case we need 'em, I'm getting more of all the things you stole.
willow_rosenberg I didn't - why do you do that?
anya What?
willow_rosenberg You're so rude! I mean, sure, at first, ex-demon, doesn't know the rules. Well, you been here forever. Learn the rules.
anya Rules are stupid.
willow_rosenberg Great, whatever. I just thought you might be interested in learning to act more human. Some of us enjoy it. Oh, look for, uh, spells with dimensional portals too.
anya I *am* a human. And there are ... many humans who are stranger than me.
willow_rosenberg Uh-huh, but, unless I'm really wrong about crazy Larry down at the bus stop, he's probably not gonna turn Xander into a troll.
anya Well, now, that's a very complicated proced... Oh. You think I'm gonna hurt Xander? I would *never* hurt Xander! You really think I would do that!
willow_rosenberg Anya, it's what you do. You spent what, a thousand years hurting men? You got your thousand years of hurting men gold watch.
anya I was a demon then, and, and I don't even have any powers now! Is this the spell?
willow_rosenberg Only if you want him to double in size, and grow extra arms, which ... let's not. A-and by the way, you weren't a demon when you turned Olaf into Lord of the Hammers. You managed that. Also, there's ... other ways to hurt Xander.
anya I don't do magic now. You're the one with that kind of power. In fact, D'Hoffryn offered you my old job. You're closer to being a vengeance demon than I am, maybe Xander should be afraid of you.
willow_rosenberg Xander's my best friend!
anya Oh, and you don't want anyone else to have him. I know what broke up him and Cordelia, you know. It was you! And your lips!
willow_rosenberg No it was not! Well, yes it was so, but ... that was a long time ago. Do you think I'd do that again?
anya Why not?
willow_rosenberg Well, hello, gay now.
anya But you're always doing everything you can to, to point out how much I'm an outsider. You've known him since you were squalling infants together. You'll always know him better than I do. You could sweep in and, and poison his mind against me.
willow_rosenberg You're insane! I am not gonna take him away and I am not gonna hurt him.
anya Well, I'm not either!
olaf Aha!
olaf I knew it. You two, performing more spells. I could be out pillaging, devouring babies, making merry with the local virgins, but instead, I had to come all the way back here to kill you.
willow_rosenberg Run!
xander_harris No, get away from them!
olaf I will get away from them, after I kill them.
xander_harris You are not touching these women.
olaf Ah, you wish for more? Admirable!
olaf You fight well, although you are a tiny man. I shall reward you. Only one of your women shall die, and you shall be the one to choose.
willow_rosenberg Did he just say-
olaf Ha ha. Choose! Anyanka or the witch. One of your women must die.
xander_harris No. You are one crazy troll, I ... I'm not choosing between my girlfriend and my best friend. That's insane troll logic.
anya Go Xander. I love you.
olaf Good for you. You are a loyal man.
willow_rosenberg Xander!
olaf Now. Choose!
anya Olaf, no!
xander_harris I'm not choosing.
olaf Then you shall be the one who dies.
anya No! Choose me! Just don't take him! Don't take Xander!
.#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode11 Damn.
anya Buffy!
willow_rosenberg Tara, stay back!
anya Buffy, the hammer! The strength's in the hammer!
anya How can I help?
willow_rosenberg Uh, distract him from Buffy, uh, piss him off.
anya I don't know how.
willow_rosenberg Anya, I have faith in you. There is no one you cannot piss off.
anya Hey Olaf! You're as inadequate a troll as you were a boyfriend!
anya Uh, y-you're hairy, and unattractive, and even women trolls are put off by your various odors.
._#unknown#BuffyTheVampireSlayer.Season05.Episode11
anya Your menacing stance is merely alarming!
anya And your roar is less than full-throated!
olaf Desist! My god, woman, it's been a thousand years, and yet you are as aggravating and emasculating as ever you were.
willow_rosenberg Vola cum viribus, dominum tuum nega. Vola!
anya Hey, good job.
willow_rosenberg You too, very irritating.
buffy_summers So. Your power's in your hammer?
anya Oh, yeah! I forgot he still has all that troll strength.
olaf You shall all die! I will dispense no mercy now!
olaf What are you fighting for, minuscule blonde one? Your friends? These two? They will never last. Anyanka is very difficult to live with, and he... he's ludicrous and far too breakable. Their love will never last.
willow_rosenberg She's got him now.
anya Poor baby.
xander_harris You really dated him?
anya Yes.
xander_harris But you like me better, right?
anya Yes! Oh, and Willow likes you too, but not in a sexy way, you know, 'cause she's gay. And she's not gonna try to break us up, so, you know, it's all okay.
buffy_summers Their love... will last ... forever!
willow_rosenberg Let the transposition be complete.
buffy_summers Where did you send him?
anya The land of the trolls.
anya He'll like it there. Full of trolls.
willow_rosenberg It's hard to be precise, though. Alternate universes don't stay put. Trying to send him to a specific place is sort of like ... like ... trying to hit a ... puppy, by throwing a live bee at it. Which is a weird image, and you should all just forget it.
anya It's possible that he's in the land of perpetual Wednesday ... or the crazy melty land ... or, you know, the world without shrimp.
tara_maclay There's a world without shrimp? I'm allergic.
willow_rosenberg He, he's probably in troll land.
buffy_summers I only care that he's not here, and I got this nifty souvenir.
buffy_summers Oops.
xander_harris The place is trashed enough anyway.
buffy_summers Well, see how well things worked out? And look at you guys. So good and alive and together. So together, and ... good, and ... alive... Oh, god... I'm ... I'm just so happy for you...
rupert_giles I cringe to think what the place would have looked like if I'd been away for longer than three days.
buffy_summers Well, maybe we would have had time to clean it up. You know, if Willow used some magicks to help.
rupert_giles Yes, 'cause nothing could possibly go wrong with that.
joyce_summers Rupert, I still don't understand - oh, thank you - why the other Watchers made you go all the way to England when they don't know anything.
rupert_giles Well, they don't know it ... yet. I mean, they have no record of, of Glory or anyone like her, but, uh, based on the information that I've given them, they're gonna look into it. Um, they might have something soon.
buffy_summers What about the key? Were they all over it?
rupert_giles Yes. You, you know all of this?
joyce_summers I got some of it myself, Buffy told me the rest.
rupert_giles Well, they're interested, certainly, and, uh, full of theories. Most of them ... nonsensical.
buffy_summers They don't know that it's Dawn.
rupert_giles No.
joyce_summers I still can't begin to grasp this. I mean, she's my little girl, I...
rupert_giles It is disorienting.
buffy_summers Giles, what happens if they figure it out? What would they do?
rupert_giles I don't know.
joyce_summers Oh, I can't even think about this. It's too ... I'll get some more milk.
