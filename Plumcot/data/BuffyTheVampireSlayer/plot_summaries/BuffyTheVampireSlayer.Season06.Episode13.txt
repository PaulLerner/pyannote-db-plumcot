After Jonathan, Andrew, and Warren accidentally kill Warren's ex-girlfriend Katrina, they set Buffy up to make her believe it was she who killed the girl.
Buffy goes to Tara, concerned about the fact that Spike can harm her without triggering his chip. She also gets mixed up with the Trio's latest scheme, creating a new device which will make women their mindless slaves, which goes horribly wrong when Warren's ex-girlfriend Katrina is accidentally killed. The Trio set Buffy up to make her think that she has killed Katrina - and it works. Between finding out the truth about her resurrection and believing that she has killed an innocent girl, Buffy's world begins to fall apart, and she ends up revealing to Tara that she and Spike are having sex.
