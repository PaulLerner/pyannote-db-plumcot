As the Christmas holiday approaches, Angel is tormented by evil apparitions who want him to eliminate Buffy.
People in Sunnydale prepare for Christmas time, except Jewish Willow, who tells lover Oz she's ready for physical intimacy but he decides to wait. Now that his physical suffering is over, Angel is haunted by a nightmares and visions, always and everywhere, about Angelus' horrible past since the 19th century, with victims and other persona appearing and talking to him. Learning those visions even enter Buffy's dreams, focusing on sex with her to lose his soul and then killing her, Giles agrees to do research as Angel desperately begged him. He is helped by Buffy and Xander, for whom Christmas is a nightmare lacking any family celebration. They find that Angel is tormented by the Bringers or Harbingers, the high-priests of the First Evil, older then demons and incorporeal, and Buffy finds the mark of its residence. Angel can't stand the fear of giving in to temptation at the price of her life and resolves to commit suicide by sunrise. Buffy pleading to make him resist seems to fail and only a Christmas miracle can save the seasonal day.
