Sunnydale High is re-opened, with a new designed campus and a new principal, Robin Wood. It is Dawn's first day at school there and Buffy accompanies her to class, only to discover evil spirits lurking in the basement.
It's Dawn's first day at the newly re-opened Sunnydale High School, and it's just like old times for Buffy as some undead students rise up and blame the Slayer for failing to protect them. Dawn and Buffy, together with some of Dawn's new friends, join together to defeat the evil. Meanwhile, the newly-ensouled Spike is seeking solace in the basement of the new school, and Willow is progressing in her rehabilitation with Giles in England.
