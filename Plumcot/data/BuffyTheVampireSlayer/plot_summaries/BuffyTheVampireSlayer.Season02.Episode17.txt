Joyce and Buffy hash out some difficult mother-daughter stuff, but still Buffy does not tell the her mother the whole truth of the problem. Jenny Calender hopes to redeem herself in the eyes of Buffy and Giles by attempting to translate the Gypsy curse and restore Angelus' human soul. Unfortunately, Angelus is ahead of her and the gang loses a member. A grief-stricken Giles takes off on his own for revenge.
