Faith returns to Sunnydale just as a new villain, Caleb, arrives and sends Buffy a message in the form of a badly beaten Potential. Buffy leads the rest of the girls to Caleb and The First's lair, with devastating consequences.
Willow returns to Sunnydale from Los Angeles with a powerful ally: the rogue Slayer Faith. But the First has a new piece on the board as well. A misogynistic "preacher" named Caleb has come to town, and he throws down the gauntlet as soon as he enters Sunnydale when he attacks a Potential Slayer, named Shannon. Faith's arrival causes tension between Buffy and everyone else because of her past, while the rest of the Potential Slayers react, instead, with fascination and curiosity. Spike, on the other, hand, seeks a bond with Faith over their similar life of being bad. Having learned of Caleb's arrival, Buffy, the Scoobies, and the Potentials go to Caleb's residence to take up the challenge - but with disastrous results.
