With Spike missing, the gang try to regroup and clear the damage done to the Summers home. Giles arrives and reveals that the First Evil is trying to destroy the Slayer line by killing all the Potential Slayers. Buffy and Giles search the Christmas tree lot where she last faced the First, and she encounters a creature out of nightmare called a Turok-Han.
