While hospitalized with a severe case of the flu, Buffy battles a demon that sucks the life out of sick children.
Buffy barely survives Angelus' latest attack because she falls prey to a very common enemy: influenza, an epidemic among Sunnydale Highs students. Yet, in the hospital, a place she fears since she was alone with a dying close cousin, aged 8, she lends credence to children who claim there is a killer invisible to adults which comes at night who they call Death. Initially, Giles is skeptical, but after Buffy, who suspected Dr. Stanley Backer who has a dodgy record, experienced it herself, the monster is found out to be an actual child killer (Kindestod in German) which Buffy should slay.
