After discovering the corpses of two young children bearing a symbol linked to the occult, Joyce spearheads a campaign to rid Sunnydale of witches.
The discovery in Sunnydale park of a boy and girl, aged 7-8, apparently murdered ritually as indicated by markings, soon tracked to witchcraft as used by sorcery apprentice Willow, has an unusual emotional effect. Buffy's mother, who was there in an attempt to bond with Buffy, founds the soon influential Mothers Opposing the Occult, MOO, which targets anything remotely occult related, actually urged by the two killed kids to 'hurt the bad girls'. Eagerly helped by Principal Snyder, Mayor Wilkins and the police, MOO manages to have the school lockers searched, Giles' books confiscated. This escalates to burning any suspected practitioner at the stake, even if this extreme 'punishment' concerns their own daughters. When the gang realize nobody ever identified the kids, they find there's more to Hans and Greta Strauss, in their dark past.
