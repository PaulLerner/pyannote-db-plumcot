Buffy finds herself at odds with her new roommate and is troubled by a series of disturbing dreams involving a soul-sucking demon.
From the start, Buffy didn't get along with her fussy, girlish roommate Kathy Newman, who seems to have a different taste in all matters. But Kathy seems determined to follow her around. One evening, Buffy shoves her out of the way to fight off a demon which Giles, to whom she turns in search of anything familiar, later determines as trans-dimensional. Even Parker Abrams, the nice, helpful older student Buffy met, who came for her to their dorm room while she patrolled, seems more interested in Kathy. The antagonism between the rivaling roomies grows, while Buffy believes that Kathy's toenails growing back daily must be a monster-characteristic. At last, the gang decides to intervene, but an unexpected other interested party is also looking to intervene.
Buffy has frictions with her selfish roommate Kathy Newman, who has opposite tastes and habits, and gets nightmares with weird monsters. When Buffy sees that Kathy's toenails restore every morning, she tells Giles and her friends that Kathy might be a monster, but they don't believe her.
