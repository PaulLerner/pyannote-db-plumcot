Xander and several other students are possessed by the spirit of a demonic breed of hyenas that wreak havoc at the high school
On a school field trip to the zoo, Kyle DuFours's gang of bullies taunt good boy Lance, till Xander stops them balancing the nerd over the fence of still quarantined hyena's. Suddenly, they are all eerily effected by the evil beasts' magical stare. Willow is completely smitten with Xander, but he chucks in her math tutoring when the hyena spell progresses, as sensed by the piglet Herbert that Principal Bob Flutie introduces as mascot for the Sunnydale High School's 'Razorbacks' football team. Next, Xander dumps Willow, fully joining Kyle's 'hyena pack' of bullies. When the four known bullies are called in to Flutie's office for devouring mascot Herbert, they eat him, too. Luckily, Xander wasn't involved as he was forcing himself upon Buffy, who knocked him down and locked him up. Giles, who first thought Xander was just suffering from pubertal hormones, now realizes it's a Massai Primal cult soul transfer, and Buffy tells him about what zoo keeper Dr. Weirick told them about the nasty hyenas. So they go talk to him while Willow stays with Xander, and learn hyenas retrieve a missing pack member for the next hunt, but not his secret.
