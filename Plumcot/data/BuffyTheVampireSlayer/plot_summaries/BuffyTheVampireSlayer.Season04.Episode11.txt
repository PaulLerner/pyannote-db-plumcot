While attempting to redefine her relationship with Riley, Buffy must also stop demons that are determined to reopen the Hellmouth.
Buffy tells soldier Riley, who insists to be a nice, otherwise normal Iowa boy, she knows all about his secret military commando unit and that she is the slayer, and they agree on discretion and a time-out. However mismatched the involuntary house-mates are, frustratingly 'implant-innocent' Spike fails a suicide attempt by falling on a stake. Willow is sad to find Percy drove to Sunnydale all the way from USC to visit Laurie but considers her a negligible nerd. Giles presumes Buffy's panic after an seismic tremor unjustified, till he checks the triangular mark carved into a corpse Willow found a bed, left by a demon associated with the sacrifice of three. Buffy and Riley find one in the cemetery, each team is alerted, and the Word of Valios, it robbed by the demons, who may now be able to open the apocalyptic Hellmouth in the high school ruins left from the mayor's ascension.
While Buffy and Riley disclose their secret lives to each other, three demons try to collect some objects for a ritual of sacrifice to open the Hellmouth for the Apocalypse. Finding that he can fight evil, Spike joins Willow and Xander in their hunt for demons.
Now that Riley knows that Buffy is the Slayer, and she knows that he is one of the mysterious commandos, they are having a hard time redefining their relationship. Meanwhile, to distract Giles from focusing on the commandos, Buffy tries to convince him that the recent earthquake might be a prophecy of doom and should be investigated. Then, when a new group of demons shows up in town stealing items of a mystical nature, it appears that she may be right after all.
