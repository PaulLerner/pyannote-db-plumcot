Buffy suspects that a ventriloquist's dummy may be harvesting organs from classmates performing in a talent show.
Mr. Snyder, Sunnydale High's new principal after the devouring of fatherly Mr. Robert Flutie, believes in order and discipline to instill school spirit. So he orders Giles to produce a talent show and punishes the Buffy, Xander and Willow by forcibly enrolling them as candidates. Then, dancer Emily is found with her heart cut out, but demons don't usually use a knife, yet one was found next to her. So, the human student contestants are screened. The weirdest suspect proves to be gifted ventriloquist Morgan Shay, who treats his inseparable wooden dummy Sid as real, in fact takes orders from it in private. And if it is, as Giles suspects, one of seven demons who take possession of human bodies, anybody may be turned bad by it.
