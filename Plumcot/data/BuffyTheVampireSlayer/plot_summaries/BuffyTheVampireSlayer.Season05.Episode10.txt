After Buffy catches Riley in the clutches of a vampire-junkie, Riley makes an important decision regarding their relationship.
After the surgery on Joyce, the surgeon tells Buffy, Dawn, Riley, Giles, Willow and Xander that the procedure was successful and the brain tumor had been totally removed, and Joyce would stay in the hospital for observation. While Anya and Xander watch Dawn, Buffy and Riley spend the night together in her house. However, the snoopy Spike sees Riley leaving Buffy's place in the middle of the night while stalking her, and finds that Riley is addicted to vampire bite in a junkie nest where people pay to be bitten by vampires. He discloses the truth to Buffy, and she breaks with Riley after an argument. When the Initiative invites Riley to go on an operation in Belize, he gives an ultimatum to Buffy about the future of their relationship.
