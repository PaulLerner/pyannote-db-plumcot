Meanwhile, Buffy is catatonic and Willow goes into her mind, finding that Buffy feels guilty for Dawn. Spike recalls that Ben and Glory are two entirely separate entities sharing one body and tells the Scooby gang. Glory is waiting for the exact moment to activate the key with Dawn's blood, turning down the barrier of dimensions and mixing the different realities into each other.
