A series of strange occurrences lead Buffy and her friends to discover that their worst nightmares have literally become reality.
At the hell-mouth, the Master of evil explains to his boy heir Collin that fear rules people better then love or hate. He manages to use the young schoolboy Billy Palmer to make every student of Sunnydale High's terrifying nightmares come true, ranging from Xander appearing in class wearing only boxer-shorts to being chased by murderers, losing one's favorite abilities or poisonous spiders coming out of one's schoolbooks...
Xander walks into class naked except his boxers-shorts, Willow is in concert but she can't sing, and Giles suddenly finds himself unable to form coherent sentences - the residents of Sunnydale are living out their worst nightmares, and Buffy's nightmares are worse than most.
