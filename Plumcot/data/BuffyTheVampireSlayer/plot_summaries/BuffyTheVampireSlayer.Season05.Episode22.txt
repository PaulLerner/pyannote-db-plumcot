As Glory prepares Dawn for a bloodletting ritual that will open a portal to another dimension, Buffy and her friends prepare for battle.
In the 100th episode, another imminent apocalypse is at hand in Sunnydale. Buffy must square off against a God when Glory prepares to use Dawn to break down the walls between the dimensions and unleash all Hell on Earth. Buffy and the gang go to battle, knowing that not all of them will survive.
Buffy tells the gang that she will kill anyone that would harm Dawn. Anya suggests the use of the Dagon Sphere and the Troll's hammer to fight against Glory. While in the basement looking for the magical objects, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory prepares Dawn for the ritual and the Scooby gang uses Tara to find the exact location where Glory is. Willow retrieves Tara's brain from Glory, and while Buffy and the gang battle against Glory and her followers, Doc unexpectedly makes Dawn bleed, opening the gate to hell and forcing Buffy to a deadly decision.
