Andrew creates a documentary called "Buffy, Slayer of the Vampyres", a record of the current situation in Sunnydale to show to future generations. He manages to capture many important moments, and to annoy almost everyone in the house. But Buffy needs to tear him away from his filmmaking because the Seal of Danzalthar is active and Andrew may hold the key to closing it before it destroys the town.
In order to document Buffy and the gang's heroic adventures for future generations , Andrew uses a video camera to film a day in the life of the Scoobies (much to the annoyance of everyone else). However, during this he is linked to the Seal of Danthalzar and must face up to the crime he committed.
