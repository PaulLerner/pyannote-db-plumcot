Cordelia's wish for a Buffy-free Sunnydale comes true, plunging her into a world where vampires have control of the town.
Wanting to be rid of Xander for good, Cordelia comes to the conclusion that Buffy is the cause of all her problems and makes a wish to the new transfer student, Anya, that Buffy had never come to Sunnydale. Anya, being the evil and powerful vengeance demon Anyanka, grants that wish and in a heartbeat, the entire world changes and everything Cordelia knows is completely different. In this alternate reality of 'It's a Wonderful Life gone to Hell', the Master is alive and rules the town after dark from the Bronze, both Xander and Willow are vampires, and Giles, with a small group of brave students, called The White Hats, are fighting a losing war of attrition against the vampires on their own. Then, in a shocking turn, Cordelia gets killed by the vamps, leaving the alternate reality Giles to figure out on his own what has happened to this world they currently live in, leading to a meeting with the alternate reality Buffy.
