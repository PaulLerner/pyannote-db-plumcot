While Riley's health begins to deteriorate, Spike and Harmony force a surgeon to remove the behavior modification chip embedded in Spike's brain.
Joyce faints while at home, and while the gang is at the hospital, Dawn discovers that Riley's heartbeat is off the charts, but Riley ignores it. When Buffy enlists the Initiative's help, Riley gets angry and runs, and he eventually admits to Buffy that he's afraid they'll make him a normal guy, causing her to lose interest in him. She manages to get him to the Initiative doctor, only to find that Spike has forced the doctor to remove his chip...
While patrolling in the cemetery, Buffy meets Riley and Spike and becomes upset with their presences. The next morning, Giles shows the exercise room that he built in the back of his store for the training of Buffy. Meanwhile, Harmony looks for a hideout in Spike's place, and she is manipulated by him to kill Buffy. Joyce faints in the kitchen and goes to the emergency room, but she is apparently okay. Dawn plays with an intern's stethoscope and finds that Riley has a severe tachycardia, but he does not want to be treated. Buffy contacts Grant and he brings Goodman and Brown, from the Initiative, trying to convince or force Riley to go under examination with a doctor. However, Spike and Harmony break into the hospital and take the doctor and forces him to remove the chip implanted in Spike's head. Buffy chases Spike and the doctor save Riley. Spike finds out the doctor really didn't take the chip from his head as it was too complex for him.
