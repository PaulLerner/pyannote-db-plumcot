When teen vampire slayer Buffy tries to start a new life at Sunnydale High, she discovers that the school sits atop a demonic dimensional portal.
Buffy Summers just moved with her mom from L.A. (where she set fire to the school gym) to Sunnydale, which is, alas, experiencing a plague of vampires. She meets nerd Willow Rosenberg, cool skateboarder Xander Harris, and his mate Jesse McNally, fashionable snooty Cordelia Chase and the somewhat creepy British librarian, Rupert Giles. When a corpse with bite-marks is found in a locker, she realizes, but refuses to acknowledge, that her vampire-killing past is catching up with her and keeps Giles, her watcher (trainer), at arms-length, but is stalked by Angel who refers to the hell-mouth. Finally her destiny kicks in.
Buffy Summers moves from L.A. to the strange town of Sunnydale after getting kicked out of her previous school. On her first day of school, she meets the Librarian Giles, two new friends, Willow and Xander, the potential antagonist, Cordelia, and a mysterious gentleman, Angel. She is the Vampire Slayer and her mortal destiny is to slay vampires.
Buffy Summers moves to Sunnydale and discovers that it is far from the fresh start that she wanted to make. She manages to make new friends, only to realize that she can't leave her past behind her. She soon is thrust back into the world which she tried to escape. Her school librarian is her watcher, a mysterious stranger warns her of what is to come, and a couple of her new friends need to be rescued.
