An Incan Princess mummy is reanimated in Sunnydale where she sucks the life force from others in order to stay alive.
While on a field trip to the local museum, one of the students breaks a ceramic seal in the coffin of an Incan mummy, who rises and must consume the life-force of others in order to remain alive. She tries to fit in with the students at Sunnydale, and even starts to have real feelings for Xander. But when Buffy, Willow, and Giles realize who and what she really is, they may have to rescue Xander before he becomes the mummy's next victim.
The Sunnydale High kids had mixed feeling about the cultural exchange program students. During a field trip to the local museum's Inca exhibition, weirdo student Rodney Munson breaks the ceramic plate which seals the protective curse in the coffin of an Incan mummy, who rises, giving him a kiss which instantly mummifies him and gives her back life. While looking for the missing student, Willow notices the mummy has braces just before an Inca warrior attacks but runs away after looking at the mummy. Ampata, the South American boy exchange student who comes to stay with Buffy, is the next kiss victim. When she is picked up by Buffy, Xander is attracted to her and volunteers as her local guide. The warrior lurks around, but not for long as he to is kissed to keep the mummy alive. By the time Giles deciphers the pictograms on the seal, Ampata is at the dance with Xander, probably about to kiss him.
