Buffy and her friends encounter even more trouble than expected when the eggs they are given in health class turn out to be prehistoric parasites that take over their lives.
While Buffy is in trouble with her mother, who believes she's too selfish to think of anything other then boys and clothes, and resorts to grounding, the brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, who murdered an entire Mexican village even before they turned into vampires, are spotted, presumably attracted by the Hellmouth. Meanwhile, a teacher who worries about irresponsible teenager sex, resorts to the parenting eggs lesson, only absent Buffy is a 'single mother'. Of course in Sunnydale, the eggs turn out to be not poultry but something nasty, dangerous and mysterious, of the body snatching order.
