A Nigerian mask reanimates the dead, forcing Buffy to battle a horde of zombies.
Buffy is back home, to her mother Joyce's great relief, which calls for a dinner invitation for the while gang. But the mood remains gloomy, despite her resuming the main slaying tasks, because others things can't just return to their former state. Partly because the obviously amused principal Snyder pays no attention to pleas to take Buffy back (mother's threat to take the case to the mayor even has an inverse effect). And Buffy still dreams of Angel. After a dead cat found in the Summers bookcase reanimates, other stinking corpses come to life again, a phenomenon which might have something to do with a the mysterious Nigerian mask with lighting red eyes Joyce bought, fortunately no secret to Giles.
Buffy returns home, but finds that picking up the pieces of the life she left behind may not be as easy as she had hoped. The militant and misanthropic Principal Snyder (still under orders from the mysterious and unseen Mayor of Sunnydale) refuses to readmit her to school. Even Buffy's mother, Joyce, who tries to accept her back with open arms, doesn't seem to trust that Buffy won't just run away again. Her friends seem happy to see her, but their odd behavior suggests they silently resent Buffy for taking off, while Buffy herself refuses to confide in anyone about what happened to her. But before these problems can be laid to rest, the dead of Sunnydale start to rise and are drawn to a Nigarian Death Mask recently purchased by Joyce, forcing Buffy the gang to once again team up to save the day.
