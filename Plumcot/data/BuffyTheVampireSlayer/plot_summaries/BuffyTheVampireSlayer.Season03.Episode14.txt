Faith convinces Buffy to live on the wild side, with fatal consequences.
The gifted students enjoy early college admissions, while Xander and Buffy rather worry about present high-school exams. The mayor and his cronies look forward to his demonic ascension, after 100 days of invulnerability. Buffy's council-appointed new, young Watcher, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, is received coldly, forbids Giles even to be kept informed but proves his research-excellence by identifying instantly swords as belonging to the 15th century duelist vampires sect El Eliminati, the survivors of which still look for demon Balthazar's buried amulet. Buffy and Faith successfully search for it at the cemetery and clean out a vampire layer. Angel takes the amulet: it's not safe enough with greenhorn Wesley. The order reports to Balthazar about his amulet. Impetuous Faith drags Buffy along, they get arrested and Faith kills Deputy Mayor Allan Finch, accidentally. Both Watchers get captured by the sect, Angel brings the slayers.
