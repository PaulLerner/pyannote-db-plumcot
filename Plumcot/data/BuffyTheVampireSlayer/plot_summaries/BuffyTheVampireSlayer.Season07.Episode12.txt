Buffy takes the Potentials to a demon bar and then to Spike's crypt, in order to teach them the art of slaying. When Willow casts a spell to seek out the next Potential, the spell leads them to believe that Dawn may be a future slayer.
Buffy and Spike begin to train the Potential Slayers, while Willow uses magic to determine the location of another Potential Slayer that the Coven's seer has informed her is living in Sunnydale. To everyone's surprise, it points straight at Dawn. Meanwhile, Buffy continues to teach the Potentials about Slayer life.
