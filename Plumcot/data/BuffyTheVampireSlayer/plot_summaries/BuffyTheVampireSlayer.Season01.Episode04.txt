Buffy's biology teacher is killed by a giant praying mantis that assumes the form of a beautiful substitute teacher.
Xander dreams of greatness. In Biology class the teacher, Dr. Gregory, is secretly eaten afterward, disappears, and is declared missing. Meanwhile, Angel gives Buffy another cryptic warning (and his black leather jacket) but no real personal info. A substitute teacher Ms. Natalie French steps in to continue the Biology lesson on insects, and her good looks guarantee volunteers after class. Later, Cordelia Chase finds Dr. Gregory decapitated. To Buffy's surprise vampires flee from Ms. French, leaving her and Giles to wonder why. She asks pheromone-soaked Xander to come study with her after class. Another student, Blayne also went to her house, but he didn't return from his previous appointment with Ms. French. When Xander arrives at her house he ends up drugged and locked up in her basement. He still refuses to believe his 'hot date' is a shape-shifting bug, even after being trapped with Blayne, but when she resumes her mantis-form, the and puts Xander in the cage with Blayne he realizes she is something evil. Giles finds out exactly what she is: a Virgin-Killer, and has Willow send Buffy to Ms. French's house. The only problem is that the Virgin-Killer stole the real Mrs. French's identity...Will Buffy make it in time to save Xander and destroy the Mantis' eggs?
