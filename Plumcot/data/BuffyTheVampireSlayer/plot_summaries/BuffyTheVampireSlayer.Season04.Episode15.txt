Faith awakens from her coma and seeks revenge against Buffy.
Buffy and the gang are looking for the loose demon-human-machine composite killer Adam which professor Maggie Walsh created as the ultimate soldier, but find only the corpse of a demon he dissected just like a human boy before. They were about to brave the Initiative's military base to get Riley back, but he already walked out, recovering reasonably from a stab wound he got when Adam broke in, however in even more painful doubt about his future and purpose now the military logic of just following orders is discredited. In the hospital, the Slayer Faith wakes up after months in a coma and a series of nightmares, mostly with Buffy as her enemy. She escapes and sees the Mayor's posthumous tape, which comes with an object to encourage Faith to 'go out with a bang' fighting Buffy, to which end she breaks in at Joyce Summers' home.
Waking up from a long, deep coma having nightmares with Buffy, Faith goes after Buffy bent on revenge. Riley leaves the facility and meets Buffy. Looking for Adam, Buffy, Xander and Willow find a demon he dissected in the woods. Faith captures Joyce and Buffy fights for her mother.
