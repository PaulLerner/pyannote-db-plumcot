After being bested in a fight by an ordinary vampire, Buffy asks Spike to explain how he killed two Slayers many years earlier.
While patrolling the cemetery, the self-confident Buffy fights against a vampire, is stabbed with her own stake and saved by Riley. She tells the incident to Giles and decides to research how the previous Slayers were killed. She does not find any information in the Watcher's journals and decides to seek the information from Spike. He tells that in 1880, in London, he was a bad poet and a shy good man in a non-corresponded love with Cecily. When he meets Drusilla, she bites and converts him into the evil vampire. Later, in the same year in Yorkshire, he meets Angelus and Darla and is challenged to defeat a slayer. In 1900, in China, he kills his first slayer. In 1977, in the subway of New York City, he kills his second slayer. He advises Buffy that she must never be reckless and keep her death wish to survive.
