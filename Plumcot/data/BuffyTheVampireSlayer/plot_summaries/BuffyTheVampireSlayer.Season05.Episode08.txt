Glory transforms a snake into a terrifying monster in her quest to find the Key; Joyce is hospitalized after being diagnosed with an illness.
Joyce goes to the hospital for a CAT scan, the doctor finds a shadow and she is immediately submitted to a surgery. The doctor discloses that she has a low grade glioma (i.e. a brain tumor). Buffy wants to use magic to heal her mother, but Giles, Willow and Tara advise her that it would be of high risk for humans. Meanwhile, Glory goes to the Magic Box, and the naive Giles sells two powerful components for an ancient Sobekite spell. Anya discovers it later through the receipts, while Glory conjures a snake demon to track the Key. When the snake demon finds Dawn in the Magic Box, Buffy and Giles follow the demon trying to kill it before it gets to Glory.
