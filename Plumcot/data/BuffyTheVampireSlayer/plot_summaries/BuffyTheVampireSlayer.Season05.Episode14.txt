Buffy learns that Spike has a crush on her - a situation made all the more dangerous by Drusilla's return to Sunnydale.
While in the Bronze with Scooby Gang, Spike sees Buffy alone at a table and talks to her. However, Buffy sees Ben and stays with him. Meanwhile, a train arrives in Sunnydale with all the passengers dead. When Buffy sees that Dawn is hanging out with Spike, she asks if Dawn has a crush on Spike, and she tells that Spike is in love with her. When Spike confesses that he is in love with her, Buffy becomes nauseated, upset and rejects him. Meanwhile, Drusilla meets Spike, convinces him that the chip in his brain does not cause pain, and Spike is back.
