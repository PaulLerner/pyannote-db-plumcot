After their horrifying loss at the vineyard, the gang turn against Buffy and begin to follow Faith instead. Meanwhile, Spike and Andrew travel to an old church to question a priest about Caleb.
In the aftermath of the defeat and loss of Molly and a few other potential slayers, Buffy is beside herself with guilt for underestimating Caleb's powers, while the twisted ex-priest launches an attack against Buffy at the deserted Sunnydale High School just as the population begins to evacuate the town when news of the Hellmouth begins to spread. That evening, Faith takes the stressed out potential slayers out to blow off some steam, but soon they run afoul of Sunnydale's Finest police force whom are still after Faith for her escape from prison back in Los Angeles. Hurting from their last battle and unsure of Buffy's leadership, the gang makes a decision that may change everything.
