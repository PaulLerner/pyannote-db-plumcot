Xander experiences an adventure of his own when he encounters a group of reanimated corpses out to construct a bomb. Meanwhile, Buffy and her friends battle the forces of evil when the Hellmouth reopens.
When Xander realizes that he isn't needed as much as he'd like to believe, his quest to prove he's cool leads him to an unforgettable night that finds him consorting with fast women, raising the dead and rolling with a dangerous crowd that could put Sunnydale in a world of hurt. Meanwhile, Buffy, Giles and the rest of the crew engage in a furious battle with the Sisterhood of Jhe, an all-female demon apocalypse cult that intends to reopen the Hellmouth and bring about the end of the world.
The gang is deeply worried, with Giles suspended their research-wings are clipped, but the activities of the apocalyptic Sisterhood of Jhe, warrior demons, indicate his worst nightmare: reopening the hell-mouth, in Sunnydale Highschool. So Xander, never taken as full, is now completely ignored, Cordy takes insults to an annihilating excess after an accident with a ball-pass he begged for but missed gets him to confront and wisely back off school bully Jack O'Toole. Thinking he needs 'his thing' to get some respectability, Xander goes for a car, only to run into Jack's in front of his criminal street gang, including a mate woken from death, who intend to use him as getaway-driver for a heist to steal the ingredients for a bomb, and to initiate him by death, but each time clever Xander shows enough initiative and good sense to survive and play his part in the survival of the world, only nobody credits him...
