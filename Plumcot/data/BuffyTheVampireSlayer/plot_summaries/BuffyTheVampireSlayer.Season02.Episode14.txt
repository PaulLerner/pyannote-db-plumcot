Buffy and her friends battle the Judge and face unexpected danger from Angel, who has lost his soul after experiencing a moment of true happiness.
Angel's night of fleshly passion with Buffy has transformed him again into the vampire Angelus, without a soul, who teams up with Spike, Drusilla and the assembled demon Judge. Willow is shocked to see Xander kiss Cordelia and turns to fellow nerd Oz. Just sensing Angel doesn't truly love her back devastates Buffy. Seeing him turned vampire again reduces her to useless tearfulness. She then makes Giles's lady-friend Janna 'Jenny' Calendar, who clearly knew something, tell about Angel's soul-curse, while Angel kills her gypsy Uncle Enyos. Meanwhile, Xander works rather literally on the line 'it took a army' to defeat the Judge.
