When Oz falls hard for a sexy singer who also happens to be a werewolf, he must choose between Willow and his own animal instincts.
Willow jealously disliked at first sight Veruca, the singer of another band, for instantly appealing to her lover Oz, but now it gets much worse, the two are embarrassingly alike in every way tested, even the last and crucial one: when his cage can't hold his werewolf-form one full moon-night, Oz escapes and fights a female werewolf, to wake up naked next to her- Veruca, and she feels werewolf is their essential, primary nature, human a 'disguise'. Buffy learns professor Maggie Walsh was followed and nearly attacked by two 'wild dogs' who fought each-other instead on campus and alerts Giles. Oz can only get Veruca safely into his cage for one thing: the hormonal lust of mating, and prefers that to killing her. Alas Willow, whose love for Oz had just got over the feeling of being left out, sees them together and is devastated. Finally another night, Oz's strongest instincts fight 'to the finish'...
When Oz feels a kind of attraction for the singer Veruca, Willow becomes very jealous and insecure about their relationship. In the full moon, Oz escapes from his cage; while chasing professor Maggie Walsh on campus, he meets with a female werewolf and they stay together all night; the next morning, Oz wakes up naked with Veruca and Willow is depressed trying to understand Oz's feelings.
