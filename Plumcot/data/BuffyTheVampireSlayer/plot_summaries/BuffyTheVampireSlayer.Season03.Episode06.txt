Adults throughout Sunnydale behave like immature teenagers after they eat cursed candy.
The students must study for standardized (SAT) tests and sell candy for the school band's new uniforms, even gang members who aren't in the band, but it's concocted by Mayor Richard Wilkins' partner, Mr. Trick and his subcontractor Ethan Rayne's men. Buffy lies to everyone so she can visit Angel, who is nearly normal again, just weak. Giles and Joyce Summers find out they are abused as false alibis but just send Buffy to bed, then work out a coordinated schedule for her and become close. The spiked candy turns adults into uninhibited, irresponsible 'teenagers'. Realizing vampires should be swarming, Buffy knocks their demonic intention out of Ethan.
