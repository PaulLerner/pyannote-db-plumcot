When Dawn learns her true identity, she runs away - only to encounter Glory.
On the day of her twentieth birthday, Buffy tells the Scooby Gang that Dawn is the Key and so they are suspicious towards her. During the night, Dawn leaves the party and breaks into the Magic Box with Spike, seeking Giles' diary and finds the truth about her. Meanwhile, Glory destroys the minions of the Knights of Byzantium and somehow switches body's with Ben, fighting against Buffy and her friends. Willow uses a powerful teleportation spell to momentarily get rid of Glory.
