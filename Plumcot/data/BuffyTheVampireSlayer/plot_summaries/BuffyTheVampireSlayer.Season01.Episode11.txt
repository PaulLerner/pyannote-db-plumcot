When an invisible menace starts attacking students and faculty at Sunnydale High, the Scooby Gang traces the problem back to Cordelia.
Cordelia's date for the May Queen election, hunky jock Mitch, is beaten black and blue in the locker-room by a 'floating' baseball bat. Angel tells Giles he can get the Pargamon Codex, the best of the missing prophecy books concerning the vampire Master. The next victim of the invisible batterer is Harmony, a close friend of Cordelia. While the gang looks into missing teenagers, presuming one has turned into a spitefully aggressive ghost as the words 'look' and 'listen' are written near the victims, English teacher Ms Miller is nearly asphyxiated. The gang finds the attacker is Marcie Ross, who became invisible because she felt nobody ever noticed her and is after vengeance on people who ignored her.
