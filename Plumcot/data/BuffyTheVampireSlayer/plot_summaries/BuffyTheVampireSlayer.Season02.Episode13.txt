To give Buffy a surprise on her 17th birthday, Drusilla and Spike bring together the body parts of a dismembered demon who cannot be killed.
While the gang is encouraged by Giles to prepare a surprise party for Buffy's 17th birthday, she has nightmares about Angel being vanished by Drusilla, who has indeed survived the fire with Spike and is preparing a revenge 'party'. They find out the hard way, by finding one of the severed armored body parts of the Judge, a terrible demon who can not be killed by any weapon and is designed to destroy all righteous people, which the vampires are reassembling.
