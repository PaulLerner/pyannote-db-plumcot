As Faith attempts to seduce Angel and steal his soul, the Mayor summons a dark-magic demon to finish the job.
Horned Demon Skyler offers to sell them the Books of Ascension to the Slayers for $5,000, so he can flee from the Hellmouth by plane. Faith informs the Mayor, who makes her steal them and kill Skyler, then turn to Angel to seduce him and turn him back to Angelus, but fails. Buffy consults the gang plus Wesley, they find a reference to a 1723 precedent when a whole English village disappeared. The mayor enlists the Shrouded Man who manages to turn Angel back into Angelus by stealing his soul, with Faith's help. The mayor demonstrates his invulnerability and approves Angelus' plan to capture and torture Buffy, just not kill her soon to avoid a replacement. Again Faith helps, but actually, Faith turns out to be the second best actor.
