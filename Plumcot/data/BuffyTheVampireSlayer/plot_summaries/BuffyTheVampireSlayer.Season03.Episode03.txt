A charismatic Slayer visits Sunnydale and wins over many of Buffy's friends. Meanwhile, two powerful vampires plot an attack.
The gang enjoys being Seniors now. The Summers girls gloat the school board overruled the principal's refusal to allow Buffy back after make-up tests, but guilty nightmares about having slain her beloved Angel still plague Buffy, who remains too gloomy to accept a charming dance invitation from cute student Scott Hope, but he sweetly persists his charm offensive. Following a suspected vampire, Buffy finds the presumed victim is the new second slayer, Faith, who considers Giles hunky for a watcher. A limousine arrives in Sunnydale with upper-class vampires: the gravely mutilated Kakistos and his lieutenant, Mr. Trick. When some underlings attack the slayers in Kakistos's name, Giles warns it's Greek for 'the worst'... Buffy admits Willow's spell had cured Angel just before she slew him; somehow he reemerges from the hell-dimension her slaying sent him to.
A new slayer, Faith, arrives in town and seems like a fun-loving, wild girl who fits right in with the gang. Buffy worries that Faith may be taking her place in her friends hearts, and she then begins to correctly suspect that Faith is hiding something. At the same time, Buffy is admitted back to school, but is still cold and distant, unable to get over or talk about killing Angel or respond to Scott Hope, a transfer student, who asks her on a date. Meanwhile, a very suave vampire, named Mr. Trick, arrives in Sunnydale with his master, the disfigured Kakistos, whom are looking for Faith to settle an old score.
