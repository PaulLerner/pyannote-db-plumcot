Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles experience dreams in which they are pursued by a mysterious figure.
Buffy, Xander, Giles, and Willow decide to stay up late watching movies after their victory against Adam, only all four of them immediately fall asleep. One by one, each of their dreams take a dark and twisted turn as a sinister force stalks each of them through the dream world and inside their own heads.
After the successful but exhausting Sumerian spell allowed Buffy to destroy Adam, they all fall asleep in front of movie videos Xander got them, and have weird visions playing into their deep fears and they all feel stalked by a shadowy figure. Thus, Willow is ostracized for her lesbianism and made a laughing stock in an unrehearsed public production of 'Death of a Salesman'. Xander is Joyce's boy-toy, utterly ignored or blatantly observed in the toilet and verbally abused, even by his father and as a soldier on his knees before principal Snyder. Giles realizes in his nightmare it must by a primeval force released as a consequence of the spell. Buffy can't find any of the gang, her mother lives walled-in, she finds Riley and Adam collaborating in a government seeking world-domination and is finally drawn to a desert, where she meets the very first Slayer.
