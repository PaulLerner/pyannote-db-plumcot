Buffy is lured into a trap by a group of undead wannabes who hope that Spike will make them vampires in exchange for giving him the Slayer.
Ford, an old friend of Buffy's from L.A., shows up unexpectedly in Sunnydale, and seems to know that she is the Slayer. When Xander, Willow, and Angel discover that he is involved with a cult-like group of disillusioned teens who idolize vampires, they must find out Ford's true agenda before it's too late.
Billy 'Ford' Fordham, a non-romantic schoolmate from Buffy's L.A. school, just moved to Sunnydale as a high-school senior because of his dad's professional transfer. He bluntly tells her he already knew she's the slayer, but belongs to an occult club which aspires eternal beauty Dracula's way, as the gang soon finds out. Angel had a fishy feeling, so he makes Willow find out on Internet Ford isn't even enrolled in school, and tells Buffy about his own gruesome past with once sweet Drusilla. Buffy notices the vampire who steals one of Giles's books is the one Ford supposedly vanished, but still walks straight into the trap he set for her at the club after making a deal with Spike at the Hellmouth to become an immortal vampire for a particular personal reason...
