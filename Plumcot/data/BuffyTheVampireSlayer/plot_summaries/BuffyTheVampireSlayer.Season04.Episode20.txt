After joining forces with Adam, Spike drives a wedge between Buffy and her friends. Meanwhile, Angel's return to Sunnydale leads to a violent confrontation with Riley.
While the Initiative brass and its political superior worry about its commandos' moral, unreliable control -loose gun Riley- and what to do with captured demons. Adam promises to put Spike back on the map as 'terrifying beast' after removing his behavior chip implant and eliminate Slayer Buffy together. Spike cleverly makes a deal with Giles, who accepts his demands for blood supply, money and immunity from slaying in return for discretion and information on the Initiative and Adam, on heavily encoded data media which even Willow finds quite a challenge. Meanwhile, Spike stirs potential strife and personal insecurities among the gang so Buffy feels isolated, such as Willow's lesbianism, only laborer Xander's lack of status and (self-)respect, Giles' midlife crisis after professional (library) retirement and feeble hold on his almost solo-slaying charge. After Xander accidentally told Riley about Angel's curse while bringing the demoralized ex-soldier silly clothes in his ruins hiding-place, both lovers' rivalry for Buffy comes near to a disaster when the soul-tormented vampire reappears in Sunnydale; one side isn't satisfied to be pacified by Buffy.
Spike associates with Adam and agrees to split the Scooby gang, and in return Adam would remove his chip. He tells each friend of Buffy as if she had made gossip: Giles and his early retirement as librarian; the lack of culture of Xander; Willow's lesbianism. He succeeds and Buffy is left alone by her friends. Meanwhile, Angel comes to Sunnydale to say to Buffy that he is sorry for their misunderstandings in Los Angeles, and he accidentally meets and fights Riley.
