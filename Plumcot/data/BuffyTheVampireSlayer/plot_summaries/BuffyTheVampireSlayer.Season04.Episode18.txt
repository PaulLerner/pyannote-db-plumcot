Buffy and Riley's passionate lovemaking energizes supernatural elements inside a frat house.
It's becoming clear Adam is bridging the natural 'racist' aversion between demons and vampires. Spike eagerly stirs Anya's insecurity, even fearing a second sex-less night means Xander, who now runs an ice cream cart, is either no longer in love or physically flaw. Riley performs great in bed upstairs with Buffy and has planned a party downstairs in the frat house, mainly for the other commandos' moral. There weird, even scary things start happening, which drive everyone out. Willow and Giles discover that Lowell house formerly was a home for problem teenagers, where the prudish, still living director Genevive Holt, punished 'dirty deeds' so horribly that several victims have become poltergeists, who now draw energy from the love-making upstairs...
In a party in Lowell House, sexuality is in the air. Buffy and Riley make love all the time, while Willow, Tara, Xander, Anya and Spike observe the weird behavior of the youngsters and the presence of ghosts. They meet Giles, and they find the origin of the poltergeists in the place.
