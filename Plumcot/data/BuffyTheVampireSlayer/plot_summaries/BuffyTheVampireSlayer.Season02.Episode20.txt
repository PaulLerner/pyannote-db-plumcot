Members of the Sunnydale swim team are killed by a gill monster of unknown origins.
Principal Snyder is so eager to see Sunnydale High's swim team go trough to the state finals that he 'suggests' Willow should spare its boys failing grades, on top of general adulation and favors. However, the best swimmers are soon murdered -in order- by an aquatic monster, unknown even to Giles and his books, which leaves only their skin, as witnessed by Xander, who enrolls as new swimmer -sexier in Speedos and braver then Cordelia ever imagined- while Buffy tries to guard the number three and most likely next target. It turns out the whole team is on special steroids, inhaled in the sauna, a secret strictly guarded by Coach Carl Marin, even when school nurse Greenleigh gets second thoughts...
