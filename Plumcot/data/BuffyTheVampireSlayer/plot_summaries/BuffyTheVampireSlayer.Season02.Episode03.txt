Buffy's mother and friends become trapped inside Sunnydale High School when a vampire named Spike launches an attack against the Slayer on Parent-Teacher night.
Principal Snyder puts 'worst students' Buffy and real rebel Sheila Martini in charge of parents night preparations as a last chance to avoid expulsion. The surviving vampires at the Hellmouth agree whoever kills the Slayer may succeed the Master, then are surprised by the entrance of Spike and Drusilla and promises the Anointed one, Collin, to do the job. Giles and Calendar warn Buffy next Saturday is St. Vigeous night, vampire prime day, still she joins the gang at the Bronze, where Spike sees her slay and promises revenge on Saturday. As if parent night weren't going bad enough, Spike's band attacks early.
Two new vampires are in town. The violent and rebellious vampire Spike and his lover, insane Drusilla. Spike has killed two Slayers already and he wants to kill a third one: Buffy. The best chance is on the night of an ancient vampire ritual, but Spike prefers to attack on Parent-Teacher Night at Sunnydale High.
