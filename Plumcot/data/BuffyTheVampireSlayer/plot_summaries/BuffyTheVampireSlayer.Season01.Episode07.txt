Buffy discovers Angel's dark secret and hesitates to do anything about it, which could spell danger for someone she loves.
The Master in the hell-mouth feels Buffy has slain too many of his 'family', so he sends the Three, strong vampire worriers, to kill her, but Angel intervenes, they both get away. Buffy takes him home to dress his wound, sees his tattoo and learns vampires killed his parents. Even knowing the Three will be killed -as punishment and as a lesson for the master's young son Colin- guardian Giles steps up Buffy's weapons training. When Angel kisses Buffy, he turns into a vampire, but jumps out of the window. However Darla, Colin's older sister, pretends to be a school friend so Buffy's ma invites her in, then bites her and arranges for Buffy to see only Angel holding her ma. Giles researched Angelus is an age old terrible European vampire, who mysteriously stopped feeding since emigrating to America. Buffy sets out to hunt Angel with a crossbow, but asks first why he spared her life, hence learns how Romany gypsies punished his cruelties by giving him a soul, and thus the pain of a conscience crushed by countless sins. Darla appears too..
