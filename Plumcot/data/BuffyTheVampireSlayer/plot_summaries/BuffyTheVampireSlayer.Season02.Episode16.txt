As Valentine's Day approaches, Xander tries to improve his love life through witchcraft and finds himself with too much of a good thing.
Nice, insecure Xander's unnatural passionate yet loveless relationship with snooty, selfish Cordelia has never felt right, but when her friends find out and decide that's the end of her popular status, she dumps him without hesitation, ironically without getting back in their favor. Being dumped on Valentine's day after he gave her a swell heart-shaped necklace is too much abuse even for Xander's low self-esteem. So when he notices Amy has taken up her mother's witchcraft, he blackmails her into putting his scorner under a love spell so he can take his revenge by dumping her just, as painfully. Alas, the novice's ineptly executed spell works on every girl except Cordelia and that means dangerous irrationality. Meanwhile, vampires Spike, Drusilla and, especially, spiteful Angelus have their own unconventional ideas about celebrating Valentine's day.
On Valentine's Day, Xander is dumped by Cordelia. He asks help from Amy, an adept witch, to make a love spell. But the spell backfires: every girl, woman and female vampire in Sunnydale falls in love with him but Cordy.
