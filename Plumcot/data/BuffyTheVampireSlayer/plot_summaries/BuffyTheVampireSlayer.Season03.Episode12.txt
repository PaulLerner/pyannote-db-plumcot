As her birthday approaches, Buffy loses her slayer powers and must do battle with a vampire who is not only extremely powerful but also quite mad.
For her upcoming 18th birthday, Buffy declines the Scooby gang's offer of a big party, hoping to celebrate with quiet reflection and a traditional trip to the ice show with her father. But Buffy doesn't know that preparations are being made for a life-threatening rite of passage that drains the slayer of her powers and then entraps her with a powerful and psychotic vampire foe.
On her 18th birthday, Buffy's dad bails out of their annual ice-show visit because of work, too late to accept a party offered by the gang. Giles reluctantly administers, under false pretenses, a weakening injection to Buffy, as part of a coming of age ritual, the ultimate Slayer test for her and her Watcher, under instructions from the Council's visiting executive. She must be locked up in a tomb with a vampire without her Slayer powers. Alas, that monster, Zackary Kralik, who is permanently kept in dungeon irons, tricks his keeper Hobson while administering his daily tranquilizer and bites the man, then kidnaps Buffy's mother to enforce a duel.
