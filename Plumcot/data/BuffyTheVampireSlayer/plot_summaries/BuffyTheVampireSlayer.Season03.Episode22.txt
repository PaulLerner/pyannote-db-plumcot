On Ascension Day, Buffy and her friends prepare for the ultimate battle as they face off against the mayor and a horde of vampires.
Now that mortally wounded Faith has thrown herself on a truck so Buffy can't bring her blood to Angel, Buffy proves her love for him by insisting he drinks his medicine, Slayer blood, from her neck, even if she has to beat him till his vampire instinct takes over. He does pull away before she's drained and carries her, unconscious, to hospital for a human blood transfusion. The mayor brought Faith in at the same ward. Already healed Angel stops his attempt to smother Buffy, who soon feels 'ready for war' herself. Both camps make attack plans. Wesley has returned to help fight the ascension against the Council's will. He asks Cordelia to follow him to England in case they prevail, sealed with kissing, but the chemistry doesn't kick in. Willow and Seth are accomplished, matched kissers. Angel confirms his intention to leave after the battle, if they win. The next morning is the graduation ceremony, with the mayor's guest speech about graduating as ascension, till a solar eclipse starts his transformation into a dragon-size demon in basilisk-shape. His vampire goons attack, faced by Angel, Wesley and other men for the possibly final fight. The gang made sure their whole graduating class came with weapons hidden under their gowns, under 'military veteran' Xander's field command, with Giles manning the secret weapon.
