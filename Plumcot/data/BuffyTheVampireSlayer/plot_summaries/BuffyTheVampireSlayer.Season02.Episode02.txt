Two science club nerds use body parts to create the "perfect girlfriend" for a teenager who has been brought back from the dead.
While arguing whether he is jealous, Angel and Buffy are attacked by a vampire, which is no problem. Then, she stumbles into an fresh grave, but remarks the body didn't rise itself as vampires do, it was dug up. Uncertain how to court a modern girl like Ms Jenny Calendar, Giles can use some dating advice, then starts researching what evil purpose digging up a girl's body may serve. His guesses being a voodoo priest creating zombies or a flesh-eating demon, which is ruled out by a dig on the graveyard. Hiding in a dumpster near school, Cordelia finds thrown-away body parts. The gang correctly suspects science class ace Chris Epps, a recluse since his elder jock brother Daryl's accidental death, and geeky yearbook photographer Eric Gittleson. They worry how far they will go as they still need a very fresh head. The third perpetrator is already Frankenstein-monstrously 'reassembled' Daryl Epps, who wants a mate and chose Cordelia's head for her.
The bodies of several recently deceased teen girls are stolen from their graves and most of the parts are discovered in a dumpster on school grounds. From the missing pieces, the gang deduces that someone has collected almost enough parts to build their own girl. Now all they need is a head. They are running out of time, so they think of a way to get an extra fresh head.
