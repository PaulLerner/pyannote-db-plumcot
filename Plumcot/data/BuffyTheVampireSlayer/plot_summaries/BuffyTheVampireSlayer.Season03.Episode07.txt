With some help from Faith's new watcher, Buffy seeks to destroy a weapon-like glove before it falls into the hands of a demon.
Gwendolyn Post, an uptight, by-the-book English Watcher, arrives in Sunnydale claiming that the Watchers Council sent her as Faith's new one, in addition to assessing the whole situation in Sunnydale, looking down upon understandably stressed Giles as on his library. She takes charge of their next common mission: stopping the demon Lagos from obtaining the Glove of Myhnegon, which is in the tomb of the von Hauptman family on Restfield Cemetery. Meanwhile, Angel, back to his tender self, gets it for Buffy, but is seen kissing her by Xander, who reports this to Giles, who is deeply hurt, especially with Mrs Post breathing down his neck, but doesn't tell her. With all of her friends angry and upset that Buffy didn't tell them that Angel had returned from Hell. Xander informs Faith about Angel's return and she plans to kill him before he may turn evil again. When Giles tells Gwendolyn about the Glove and the rite he found to destroy it, she knocks him unconscious. Her hidden agenda proves a huge problem for everyone. The gang only finds out when Faith is already on the wrong foot.
