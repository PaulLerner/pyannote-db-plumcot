As Buffy and Cordelia vie for Homecoming Queen, a group of killers gather to participate in SlayerFest '98.
The gang plans to attend the homecoming dance in a limo, where Cordelia expects to be crowned queen if she can beat Michelle Blake. Buffy decides to run after a row over Cordelia forgetting to tell her about the yearbook photo-shoot. Alas, for her, the gang is already enlisted for Cordy's campaign. Buffy finds Angel is already far gentler, back in clothes and self-control, but tells him she has another. Just then, sweet suitor Scott's patience with ever-distracted Buffy runs out: he dumps her. Deputy Mayor Allan Finch reports to the spooky Mayor Richard Wilkins the presence of the brothers Hans and Frederick Gruenstahler, wanted for murderous terrorists activities in their native Germany, who actually watch Buffy as part of Slayerfest 1998, Mr. Trick's competition, only the gang arranged for Buffy to be alone in the limo with Cordelia to make up, so they must face the hunters, not both slayers.
