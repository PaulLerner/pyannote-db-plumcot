Buffy feels like a fish out of water in her first year at college, but the mysterious disappearance of a fellow student puts her back in her element.
When the Sunnydale High gang arrives on college campus, Willow and Oz, who even knows the site and people from his band, which has a cool house, take to academic life like a duck to water. Buffy is like a fish on land, miserable with a plain roommate she can't confide in, lost, making a fool of herself with one of the rough, demanding professors. Buffy literally bumps into charming teaching assistant Riley Finn, but he is clearly more interested in fellow psychology buff Willow. Another literally lost student, Eddie, seems nice, but disappears the next morning. Buffy smells vampires, indeed a whole nest has formed a nest. Visiting Giles, she finds him with a scantily dressed visitor, Olivia, and is told to mind herself except in emergencies, not the case yet apparently, however he will reconsider later. The vampire leader is arrogant, hopefully enough to underestimate Buffy, who is greatly relieved to find Xander is back from his summer touring.
Buffy joins U.C. Sunnydale, but she is feeling lost and confused in the new environment. Alone her first night at the university, she meets Eddie (Pedro Balmaceda), another freshman in the same situation, and they schedule to meet each other in the classroom the next morning. However, Eddie is attacked by a gang of vampires leaded by Sunday (Katharine Towne), and the group leaves a message at his room as if he had not like college and left. When Buffy sees that Eddie has vanished without his very precious and favorite book, she decides to chase the vampires. Later, she realizes that she cannot face the vampires alone and asks for help from Rupert Giles, Xander Harris, Willow Rosenberg and Oz.
