Xander and Spike search for the source of a spell that has bewitched the girls into competing for the affections of the high school quarterback.
Dawn's simple crush on Sunnydale High's star quarterback RJ starts to become obsessive, leading Buffy to investigate the boy herself. When Buffy, along with all the other women who see RJ, also fall in love with him, Spike and Xander must team up to discover the source of this attraction. But first they have to keep the women from doing anything crazy in their competition for RJ's affection.
Dawn, Buffy, Anya and (suprisingly) Willow fall hopelessly in love with a high school student and will do anything to get his attention, even if it means suicide, bank robbery or even murder. But Xander and Spike realise that they are under a powerful spell and must find the source that has bewitched the girls.
