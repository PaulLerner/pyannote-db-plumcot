Giles discovers an ancient book foretelling Buffy's death at the hands of the Master.
In the first-season finale, Giles discovers an ancient prophecy which states that Buffy will face the Master and she will die. Upon hearing this, Buffy first denies her slayer roots, but when a small tragedy occurs at school, Buffy realizes she can't run from destiny, and decides to take on The Master.
Xander feels his love-life is hopeless. He will never get through to Buffy and Willow refuses to be a mere substitute. Giles is now assisted in his occult research by computer teacher Jenny Calendar. Buffy overhears Giles insist to Angel she will face the Master tomorrow to prevent the Hellmouth from opening and will die, which makes her desperately want to opt out of slaying. On prom evening, Buffy changes her mind, even knocks out Giles when he intends to go instead, but her crossbow has no effect on the Master, who eagerly expected her. This time she's the hunted party. Xander gets Angel to take him on a desperate rescue mission. They find her dead after the Master's bite her and tossed her in a pool of water, but Xander performs CPR to revive her. Willow guessed all vampires are gathering at the Bronze but they are gathering somewhere else.
