Buffy and her friends encounter a powerful vampire bent on opening a portal to a dimension inhabited by demons.
At night in the cemetery, Buffy saves Xander and Willow from vampires. Later, Giles explains their race descends from primeval demons. Meanwhile, the vampires bring Jesse as offering to their master at the hell-mouth, before his ascension and 'harvest', but hearing about a slayer, he rather keeps Jesse alive as chained bait for her. Buffy realizes the mausoleum must be the entry and, again, meets Angel there. She enters alone but Xander catches up, determined to help his friend. Giles reads up on the harvest. Jesse turns out to be a vampire already, but the heroes escape into safe sunlight. The Master anoints vampire Luke as his killing, soul-devouring vessel. Xander guesses right that Jesse will still go to the Bronze, the town's single cool club, like normal school-kids, and so does the whole vampire gang before Buffy and friends show up..
