Buffy teams with Riley after she is allowed access to the Initiative; Spike is targeted by commandos.
Buffy is working within the Initiative, excited by the military equipment and collaboration with her lover Riley, with whom she finally shares love to the full, but who proves trained as a selected soldier to follow orders without too many questions. Meanwhile, Professor Walsh hides from them a secret project, assembling 'Adam' from parts of various monster races. Xander hopes to become Anya's big spender by starting a business in 'Booster' bars, but nobody seems to like any of the flavors, at all. Spike just moved out to his crypt and told Giles he wanted nothing more to do with the gang, but has to rush back begging for their help after being shot by the commandos -now equipped with command cameras- with a dart, which Xander identifies as a tracer. Willow performs an ionization spell as camouflage during surgical removal. Professor Walsh feels inquisitive Buffy has become a liability with too much influence on Riley, and sets her up to be cornered in the sewers with two slasher demons and a faulty weapon.
Buffy is completely excited with Riley and the Initiative, questioning many points of the operation. After capturing a demon, Buffy and Riley make love, but Professor Maggie Walsh sees Buffy as a complication for the group and decides to get rid of her, betraying and sending Buffy to face death with two powerful demons. Meanwhile, Willow misses her friend and becomes closer to Tara Maclay. The selfish Spike looks for help with Giles to remove a tracking device from his shoulder.
