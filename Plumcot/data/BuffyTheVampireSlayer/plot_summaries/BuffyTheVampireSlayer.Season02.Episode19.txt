Sunnydale High School is haunted by the ghosts of a former student and teacher who reenact their tragic romance through the bodies of the school's current inhabitants.
Even by Sunnydale standards, pupils and teachers have disturbing illusions which make them do crazy things. Giles soon realizes that it is a poltergeist, and insists it must be Jenny, but Willow's research in her PC, preparing to take over the computing class, points to the 1955 incident Buffy witnesses in a vision, when student James Stanley shot dead his teacher and lover, Grace Newman. One of them is the ghost stuck in reliving the fatal tragedy, especially as its anniversary is on the high school's annual, now approaching, Sadie Hawkins Dance with gender role reversal. Willow plans an elaborate exorcism, but the ghost plays dirty. Angelus' appearance changes everything.
In 1955, a high school jock met his demise when he killed his teacher who tried to break off the affair he had. Now, he wants revenge on his teacher. Strange hauntings and occurrences happen as the ghosts possess people, a monstrous arm appears in Xander's locker, a 1955 yearbook falls off the shelf, food turns into snakes and wasps appear to scare students out of the school. Buffy and the gang must stop the spirits.
