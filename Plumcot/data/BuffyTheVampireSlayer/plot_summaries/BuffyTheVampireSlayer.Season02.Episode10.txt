Buffy joins forces with another Slayer in hopes of saving Angel from the clutches of Spike and Drusilla.
The girl who attacked Buffy turns out to be no vampire but another slayer, Kendra, who assumed her duty while Buffy was dead for a minute and works far more by the book, which Buffy didn't even know to exist. Angel fears to die as the rising sun reaches into his holding place, but is dragged out in time by snitch Willy, only to be sold to Spike, who needs Drusilla's sire to revitalize her in a demonic ritual in an abandoned church which will kill Angel, and allows her, first, to enjoy torturing the shirtless hunk with holy water. Helping Cordelia escape the maggot-made Taraka Order assassin makes Xander spike their formally continuing hatred with hot kisses, twice. A female killer fails to kill Buffy as police recruiter on career day.
