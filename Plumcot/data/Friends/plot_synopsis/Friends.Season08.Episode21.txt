The episode begins at the coffee house (where else?) and Ross comes in with a bundle of new papers. He tells everyone that he read the paper and Monica's restruant got a really bad reveiw. However, Monica walks in and discovers how bad the reveiw really is. She is really upset and decides to go with Joey to find the critic and tell him off. Meanwhile, Rachel is freaking out because the baby is nearly due and they don't have anything (changing table, crib etc.) so she and Ross go to the shops to buy some stuff. When they get there, Ross and the girl at the counter, Kate, start flirting, much to Rachel's annoyance. Back at Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe reveals to Chandler that he's really bad at first impressions. This scares him, as he has an interveiw later and so Phoebe decides to teach him how to make a good first impression. Next, Monica and Joey find the critic and he still won't change the reveiw so they decide to go home. As they're leaving, the find out there's a cooking class going on and Monica pretends to be inexperianced chef so that she looks really good in front of the teacher. Ross goes on a date with Kate but when he comes back, Rachel tells him that she doesn't want him seeing her anymore because the baby is coming soon and SHE needs him. To her surprise, Ross agrees and they are friends again. At the cooking class, Monica reveals to the class that she is actually a profitional chef and the teacher compliments her cooking. This makes Monica happy, and she and Joey leave. Finally, Chandler goes to his interveiw and everything is going well, but, right at the end, he makes a stupid joke and doesn't get the job.
