Animal Rights champion Phoebe inherits a mink fur coat from her grandmother and is freaked out about what to do with it - especially after noticing how good the coat looks on her. Rachel fogs a new neighbour accidentally with bug spray, but ends up going to a pizza place with him. Emily wants Ross to sell all his stuff because Rachel might have touched it, which makes Gunther take it all. The friends all think that Emily is carrying her point too far by also demanding Ross to move to another flat uptown. They all fear that their circle is breaking up. Finally it is Ross and Emily breaking up their marriage over the phone.
