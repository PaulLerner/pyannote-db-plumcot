Joey and Chandler take Ross to a hockey game to take his mind off the anniversary of the first time he slept with Carol, while the girls become depressed when they realize they don't have a 'plan'.
When Monica fails to make the anniversary of Ross's first time ever, not just with his lesbian ex Carol, pass unnoticed, he gets terribly depressed. Joey and Chandler take Ross to a hockey game to distract him, but it doesn't help when he catches a puck- which breaks his nose, and Nurse Sizemore in hospital admissions proves a bureaucratic hurdle even Chandler can't take... Rachel is happy to get her first-ever pay-check, till she notices how little is left after taxes, and has to pretend job-pride to her spoiled brat friends bunch turning up in Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel get hunky TV celebrity George Stephanopoulos's pizza delivered by mistake, and shamelessly spy on him from Monica's balcony...
