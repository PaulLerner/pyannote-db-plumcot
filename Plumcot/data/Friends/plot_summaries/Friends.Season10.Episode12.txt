Chaos ensues as Phoebe and Mike prepare to get married.
Monica is driving Phoebe insane as she plans Phoebe's wedding. At the rehearsal dinner, Phoebe gets really upset with Monica and fires her. The next day, Phoebe is going through hell doing Monica's job. Chandler and Ross find out that they are not included in the wedding, and when one of Mike's groomsmen can't make it, Mike lets Phoebe decide who should take the role. Phoebe passes the decision to bridesmaid Rachel; however, Mike makes his dog Chappy the missing groomsman. Joey is filling the role of Phoebe's dad during the ceremony, and he takes it too seriously. There is a giant blizzard which threatens the event, but Phoebe and Mike decide to still get married when the blizzard stops. Phoebe gives Monica her job back. Chappy can't walk on the snow, so Ross carries him. The minister can't make it, so Joey volunteers to marry Phoebe and Mike, and Chandler then fills the role of Phoebe's father.
