After the gang head up to the roof to see a passing comet, separate events unfold that lead to them all having a sleepless night.
The gang and Tag spend the evening watching a comet fly by their building. Then, events occur which cause them to lose sleep. Monica and Chandler can't sleep until Monica falls asleep during sex. Rachel and Tag try to deliver an important work document. Phoebe deals with an annoying smoke detector. Joey and Ross are stranded on the roof after Joey accidentally locks them out.
In the beginning, the 6 friends plus Tag are sitting on the roof looking for comets. Later, everyone goes inside except for Ross and Joey, who takes the tube that was holding the door open off. Ross and Joey are then locked on the roof until they get the idea to go down the fire escape. Phoebe's fire alarm keeps beeping and it won't stop. She eventually breaks the fire alarm and throws it down the trash chute. A fireman returns the fire alarm to Phoebe, who can't stop the fire alarm because the reset button broke off. Monica and Chandler can't sleep, so Chandler insists on having sex. Rachel realized that she forgets to mail something out at work, so she and Tag stop by the office. Rachel says she left them on Tag's desk, but she finds them on her own desk. She doesn't want to be proved wrong, so she makes Tag go check the copy room and then Rachel drops the papers in Tags desk.
