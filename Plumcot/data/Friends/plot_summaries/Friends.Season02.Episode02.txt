Monica goes shopping with Julie and tries to keep it a secret from Rachel. Ross is grossed out by Carol's breast milk. At his day job, Joey competes with a fellow cologne spritzer.
Joey is having trouble with a new guy at work who dresses like a cowboy and who intrudes Joey's section. Monica and Julie get along and Monica can't tell Rachel. Rachel finds out and is upset. Everyone dares Ross to try breast milk because it grosses him out. Joey dresses up as a cowboy to be the best at work again. Joey and the cowboy have their showdown and Joey wins because the cowboy sprays perfume into a customer's eyes. Rachel gives Julie a chance to be friends with her. Ross tries the breast milk after all.
Ross' baby Ben gets breast-fed, but several friends are quite uncomfortable either with the whole concept, or specifically with the tasting of the product. When Julie asks someone to go shopping with her, Monica pleases her brother Ross by accepting, but as the others point out risks Rachel's utter wrath as she will consider it as 'adulterous', especially as it is at Bloomingdales.
