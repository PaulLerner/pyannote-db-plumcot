Monica's obsessiveness is put to the test after Rachel cleans the apartment. Joey lands a film role as Al Pacino's butt double. Chandler enjoys a relationship with all of the fun but none of the responsibility.
Joey had high hopes for his lead role in 'Freud!', but the musical drama slash other nonsense is too horrible for words. For Chandler, however, it's a Godsent opportunity as he sees the breathtaking beauty Aurora in the audience. Chandler is encouraged to ask her out as 'the best-looking women often have measly men.' After a great night out, Chandler sadly reports she actually has an adventurous life, including a husband Rick and a lover Ethan. The girls commiserate as he can't just be her sex-toy-boy. However, think it is a dream come true as he would get the fun without the responsibility. Joey's role still pays off as an agent saw him and casts him as his idol Al Pacino's butt double. Alas the director can't appreciate a Joey's artistic ambitions in butt-acting. Chandler discovers good sex is no doesn't make up for lack of monogamy when Aurora announces another lover, Andrew, complicating her busy bed-schedule even further.
Joey gets a role in an Al Pacino movie, but the role is not as good as what the friends think. Chandler dates a woman that is married and has another boyfriend. Monica tried to become less of a clean freak when she doesn't like how Rachel cleaned the apartment.
