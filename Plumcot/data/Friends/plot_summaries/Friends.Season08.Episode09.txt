Monica invites Will, an old school friend of her and Ross over for Thanksgiving dinner, unaware he isn't too fond of Rachel.
Will, an old friend of Ross' is in town and Monica invited him for Thanksgiving dinner. Will used to be really fat in high school and he really hates Rachel because she was horrible to him. Will shows his hatred and tells Rachel they had the "I-hate-Rachel-Greene-Club" in high school. The members of the club: Will and Ross! Their club spread a rumor that Rachel had both male and female reproductive parts. Everybody knew about the rumor and Rachel figures that's why certain guys wouldn't go out with her. It turns out that Rachel told everyone about how Ross made out with the old librarian and Ross is so upset he wants to be in the club again. Phoebe also joins the club because she's never been in a club. Monica tells them they're being childish and they should focus on the important things going on in their lives like having a baby together.
