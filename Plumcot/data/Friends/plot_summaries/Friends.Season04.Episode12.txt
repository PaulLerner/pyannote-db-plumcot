Phoebe's uterus is examined for implantation of the embryos. Meanwhile, a seemingly harmless game between Chandler and Joey against Monica and Rachel escalates into a full blown contest where the stakes are raised higher and higher.
Phoebe has accepted to host in her uterus the artificially inseminated child(ren) of her brother Frank and his older wife Alice Knight Buffay; the anxious wait for a pregnancy is rewarded. Meanwhile a display by Chandler and Joey how well they know Monica and Rachel by guessing the items in their shopping bag leads to a large-scale bet on a quiz, for which Ross makes the questions. It goes close, but the team captains pride and sense of competition brings Monica to accept Chandlers dare to up the stakes: either the boys' birds are ousted, or the girls must exchange their master apartment for the boys measly rooms- Rachels error in the last round enables a triumphant entry of the victors.
Several of Alice's embryos are planted in Phoebe with a 25% chance that they will attach. Phoebe really wants it to work, and it's her only shot. Meanwhile, Chandler and Joey are against Rachel and Monica in a winner-take-all, "How Well Do You Know Us" trivia contest with Ross as adjudicator. The girls lose their apartment to the guys.
