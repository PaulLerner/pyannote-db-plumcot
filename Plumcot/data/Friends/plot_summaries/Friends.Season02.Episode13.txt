Ross finds Marcel on the set of a new movie, where Chandler bumps into a former schoolmate. Meanwhile, Rachel and Monica compete for the affections of Jean-Claude Van Damme.
At the site of the movie co-starring the capucin Marcel, Ross is disappointed not to get his former pet's full attention, but is promised a reunion afterward, which is however canceled. Joey attempts to get a part in the movie. The girls only have eyes for human star Jean-Claude Van Damme; since Monica is too shy to address him, Rachel asks him, but he invites her- several rows and dates are the -even literally- messy result. Chandler meets a former classmate, Susie Moss, whom he once humiliated causing her to be nicknamed 'Susie underpants', but now makes him ask her out and wear her panties, alas not just for the kick... Finally Ross gets a surprise.
