Ross is guilt-ridden after sleeping with Chloe and desperately tries to stop Rachel from finding out and when she does, the rest of the gang listen to them argue and end up trapped in Monica's room for the rest of the night.
The morning after Rachel declared they needed a break, she wakes up ready to work on getting back together - and Ross is drunk in bed with Chloe, the copy girl; Joey and Chandler warn him word will follow 'the trail' of women blabbering to Rachel, and at every step he's too late to stop it. Whe she storms in for an endless session of denial there's still love between them, whatever he tries, the other friends don't dare to leave the bedroom where Monica and Phoebe had been waxing.
