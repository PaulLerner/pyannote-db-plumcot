Monica still can't get a job, and money is becoming tight. Ross gets her to agree to ask her parents for money. Joey buys Chandler a hideous gold friendship bracelet, and overhears Chandler complaining about it to Phoebe. Ross continues to pine after Rachel, who Phoebe insists is his "lobster", but she makes it pretty clear that its not happening. However, when an old home video of Monica and Rachel's prom is discovered, Ross's true feelings for Rachel are shown.
