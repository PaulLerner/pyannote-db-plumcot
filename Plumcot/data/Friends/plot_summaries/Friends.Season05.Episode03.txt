The gang take Phoebe to the hospital after she goes into labor. Monica threatens to go on a date with a male nurse after Chandler claims they are "just goofing around." Joey gets treated for kidney stones.
Phoebe is in hospital to give birth to the triplets slightly early. Monica barely covered up to Rachel that she was with Chandler who found them two hot male nurses to date. When Chandler panics and says he and Monica are only 'messing around' they agree to see other people but neither actually likes the pact. Phoebe dislikes her doctor because he openly adores Fonzie from Happy Days. To Rachel's horror Phoebe is considering 'keeping one' of the babies. Joey has a sudden attack of pain and is diagnosed with kidney stones, and squashes Ross during a very painful procedure. To Chandler's horror, the third baby is still named after him, even when it turns out the baby is a girl.
