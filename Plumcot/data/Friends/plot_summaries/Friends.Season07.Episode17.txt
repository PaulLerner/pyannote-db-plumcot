Monica takes the other girls to an overpriced store to choose her wedding dress, briefing them as if they were in the military since bargain-hunters are far more ruthless then Rachel can usually handle. The worst shopper is Megan: she grabs the dress Monica wants, then blackmails her over booking the swing band that's the only thing Chandler really wants for the wedding. Meanwhile, Ross and Joey independently meet and date Kristen while helping her move in. The rivals agree to let her choose after one date with each, but they get so carried away cheating on the deal that she runs off altogether.
Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe go to a wedding-dress sale to buy the dress Monica picked out. Ross has a date with Kristen who just moved in across the street but the problem is that Joey had a date with her too. They will let Kristen decide who she wants, but she walks away when she hears the guys playing each other out.
