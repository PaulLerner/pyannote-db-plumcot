Ross wants to introduce Ben to Hanukkah. In order to entice Rachel to move back into their refurbished apartment, Phoebe must drive a wedge between Rachel and current roomie Joey.
Phoebe brings in her late mother's Christmas memorial candy dish, shaped like a skull. Ben stays with Ross for the holidays who intends to teach his son about their Jewish heritage. He feels Ben is only exposed to Christmas traditions. Ross certainly makes his mark on Ben but the idea of a year without Santa sounds like a serious punishment. Chandler presumes that Rachel wants to stay living happily with Joey but Monica wants her to go back to Phebes so gives Joey drums to drive Rachel out. That doesn't work so they try a tarantula which scares Joey but not Rachel who had one as a kid. Chandler's wait for a restaurant table means he might miss a theater performance; tipping the host doesn't work either as he can't find the paper money. Ross, wants to surprise Ben but can't rent any Christmas suit this late, so he invents Santa's Tex-Mex friend: the Holiday Armadillo. The Armadillo explains about Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights but Chandler appears as Santa to help out Ross. Ross however was really connecting with Ben so asks Chandler to leave, until Monica asks him to keep the suit 'for later'. Rachel goes with Phoebe visit a renovated apartment, but it has been turned into a single-bedroom place.
