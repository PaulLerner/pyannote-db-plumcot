Monica becomes annoyed at how Chandler sucks up to his boss by mimicking his boss's laugh and laughing at his tasteless jokes. Ross hooks up with Janice when he finds out Emily is getting married.
Rachel wants to know all details about Chandler and Monica, Joey paid attention to none, so she's all over Monica at Central Perk and at home, but nothing makes her spill any beans. Ross' ex Emily is going to marry; so he smashes a scone. Chandler and Monica enjoy being a couple at his office party; as his boss Doug and his wife Kara love her, they are invited to play tennis at Doug's place, where Chandler goes to great lengths to let Doug win, despite Monica who is furious he's such a suck-up at work; they get a dinner invitation, where Monica first inspires Chandler not to laugh at Doug's lame joke, then changes her mind. Ross is so frustrated he goes out with... Janice, who still thinks Chandler is in Yemen, and is amazed how well she listens, but all his whining is too much even for her. When Ross apologizes for having gone out with his ex, Chandler cleverly jumps at the chance to set the precedent for forgiving a friend going out with a girl close to a friend, such as a relative.
