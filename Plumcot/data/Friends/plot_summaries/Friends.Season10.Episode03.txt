Ross goes to a tanning salon but fails to follow the 'simple' instructions. Joey and Rachel struggle to make the transition from friends to lovers. Monica and Phoebe try to avoid an annoying woman that used to live in their building.
Joey and Rachel consider themselves ready for lovemaking, but their hands strangely refuse to deliver normal service: she keeps slapping him, he is unable to undo her bra, a standard model, which he normally can handle with only one hand. Ross is envious of Monica's tan, so he goes to the studio to get sprayed himself, but messes up the simple instructions so he ends up dark on the front and lily-white on the back. Meanwhile Phoebe and Monica are annoyed by their old friend Amanda Buffamonteezi and her fake British accent, so they decide to ignore her calls, without telling Chandler...
