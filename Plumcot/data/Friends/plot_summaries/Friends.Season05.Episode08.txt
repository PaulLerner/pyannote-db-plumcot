The gang remember and share with each other their worst Thanksgivings.
After Monica's Thanksgiving turkey dinner, the Friends elaborate on Chandler's traditional sob-story about his gay father causing a parental break-up, since then he always hated the holiday. His status as 'king of misery' is challenged, first by Ross' seasonal marriage with Emily divorced in record-time. Phoebe can only cheat with an 'earlier life', at the front-line in the Secession War. Rachel brings up the time that Joey and Monica ended up wearing the turkey on their heads, but that's easily topped by the early one from her fat youth, when Ross introduced her to Chandler at the Geller home. Chandler called her fat. Yet even worse, was the failed revenge the following year, when Chandler accidentally lost a toe, which got lost again.
