A stressed Ross desperately and insistently tries to get the rest of the gang ready for a black tie event at the museum, while Joey and Chandler clash over personal belongings and personal space.
Ross is eager to have everyone ready well in time for his 8 PM speech at the museum's benefit, but they all have other priorities then getting dressed. Joey childishly steals Chandler's armchair while he used the bathroom, and obstinately keeps sitting in it, in the process getting a stain on Phoebe's dress; when finally chased, Joey takes the pillows with him, Chandler retorts by stealing all Joey's underwear, Joey takes sordid vestimentary revenge... Monica freaks when she hears an answering machine message from Richard, even although it's probably ancient, and keeps making it worse abusing his code... Worst of all is Rachel, who takes forever to pick an outfit till Ross insists she should hurry up, never mind what she wears, then she refuses to go altogether, until Joey's flippant suggestion is taken seriously...
The gang tries to get ready for a fancy event at the museum, but numerous obstacles get in the way. Joey and Chandler fight over their belongings. Phoebe spills hummus on her dress. Rachel can't decide what to wear. Monica tried to get in touch with Richard.
