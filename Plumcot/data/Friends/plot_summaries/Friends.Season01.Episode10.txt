The gang make (and break) a pact not to bring dates to their New Years Eve party. Phoebe starts dating a scientist. Ross compensates for his loneliness by getting a monkey.
Ross is tired of living alone but doesn't want a roommate at his age so he adopts the capucin monkey Marcel. Marcel is cute in everybody's eyes, except cleaning freak Monica who returns little of the monkey's love. With Paolo about to return to Rome, it looks like New Year's Eve will see the friends desperate for someone to kiss at midnight, so Chandler launches a pact for them all not to kiss anyone. However, Rachel learns Paolo can be back early, Monica asks her ex Fun Bobby and Chandler invites his hellish ex Janice. Joey met a single mother shopping, so Ross fears to be the only single left after Phoebe hooks up with scientist David.
It is almost New Years and lonely Ross adopts capucin monkey Marcel. All the friends adore Marcel - except Monica. The friends agree not to bring dates to the New Year's Eve party, however everyone but Ross breaks the promise. However, things go wrong again; amongst all of the madness, Joey kisses Chandler at midnight.
