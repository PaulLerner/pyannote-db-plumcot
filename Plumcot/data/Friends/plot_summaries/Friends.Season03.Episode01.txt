Monica suffers from insomnia and depression following her breakup with Richard. Joey struggles to accept Chandler and Janice's relationship. Ross confides in Rachel about one of his fantasies.
Monica is a wandering zombie after dumping Richard for not sharing her child-wish. Ross confides in Rachel his sexual fantasy is princess Leia's gold bikini in Star Wars, but doesn't appreciate her telling it to blabbermouth Phoebe; when Rachel assures him boys miss out on true bonding because they don't tell each-other intimate details, he tries it with Chandler who brings up a very unfit confidence. As Joey really can't handle the prospect of Chandler not dumping Janice as usual, the two try spending whole 'day of fun' together for their common friend Chandler's sake.
Ross's secret fantasy doesn't stay secret for long after he confides in Rachel. Much to Joey's dismay, Chandler begins to rekindle his relationship with ex-girlfriend Janice after becoming strangely attracted to her again whilst corresponding over the internet.
