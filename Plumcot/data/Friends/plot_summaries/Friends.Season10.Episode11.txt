Old secrets come to light when Ross and Chandler attend a college reunion. Monica and Rachel throw Phoebe a bachelorette party. Joey appears as a celebrity partner on a game show.
Phoebe's bachelorette party has no strippers, but Phoebe had wanted one - so Rachel and Monica hurriedly hire a stripper, but he turns out to be at least 50 years old, and under 5 feet tall. Joey appears as a celebrity partner on "Pyramid", but his narrow frame of reference produces less-than-desirable clues and answers. Chandler and Ross go to a college reunion, and recall what they did as freshmen in 1987, inadvertently revealing that they had both broken their longtime pact about dating. Chandler tells Ross that he kissed Rachel at a party, and Ross gets upset because that was the night he thinks he kissed Rachel for the first time - but Monica remembers the night differently.
