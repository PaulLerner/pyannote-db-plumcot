Monica thinks Chandler is aroused by shark documentaries.
By commending her slick flirting, Ross accidentally makes Phoebe realize that she's never had a serious long-term relationship, so she breaks down in tears and gets obsessive about her present date, Mike Hannigan. Ross talks to Mike, inadvertently making him wary. For once, Joey is picked up by a girl, Hayley, who thinks he's inexperienced at dating, but at her oddly familiar apartment he feels sure he's dated her already. Joey is shocked she could have forgotten about 'always memorable' sex with him, until he notices her roommate Poppy. Monica flies to Tulsa to surprise Chandler, but outside his hotel room hears him excited, apparently about sharks. Dating expert Rachel assures her that men have have the weirdest turn-ons, so she treats her man to a shark nature documentary.
