Another cheesecake gets delivered, and they try to resist and drop it off to the neighbor that was supposed to receive it. Ross is invited to a cousin's wedding, but Monica isn't. She is very upset, because she was the girl's best friend when they grew up together, so she gets Ross to take her instead of a date. Rachel and Chandler find the replacement cheesecake untouched in front of the neighbor's door, so they take it. At the reception, Monica is embarrassed when she learns that she wasn't invited to the wedding because she used to date the groom. Phoebe meets David, the love of her life, again, but he now lives in Russia.
