Chandler's plan to propose to Monica at dinner is interrupted by Richard. Joey accidentally buys a boat at a silent auction. Ross and Elizabeth's relationship comes to a crossroad.
Tonight is the big night for Chandler: he will propose to Monica. Rachel, Phoebe and Joey go to a beneficial dinner organized by Rachel's boss. Joey bids at a silent auction because he thought you had to guess the prize and therefore buys a boat for $20,000. Just as Chandler is about to propose Richard walks into the restaurant with his girlfriend and they sit at the table next to Chandler and Monica so Chandler can't propose. Elizabeth isn't as mature as Ross had thought so he breaks up with her. Chandler doesn't want to make Monica suspicious and find out about his plan so he acts as if he was still afraid of commitment. Richard goes to see Monica at the restaurant and says he still loves her.
