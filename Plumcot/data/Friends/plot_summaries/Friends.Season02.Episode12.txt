Ross goes to visit Marcel whilst on a trip to California and discovers he is working in commercials. Joey receives a fan letter from an attractive but unstable woman. Phoebe is asked to sing for children at a library.
Joey's first fan-mail -for his character, Dr. Drake Ramore- is from Erika Ford, who sounds like a crazy stalker, so Chandler and he are scared when she turns up, but given her looks he accepts to dine together- enough for her to think she's Drake's fianc√©e. Hunky Rob Donan invites Phoebe to play songs for kids in the public library, but her brutally honest lyrics shock the parents. After seeing a monkey like Marcel in a commercial, Ross decides to visit him in the San Diego Zoo, where he's officially told the capucin died but hears the truth from a hush-hush caretaker: he's in a movie being shot in New York so they all go there...
This episode is composed of two episodes. In the first part Joey is stalked by a crazy woman named Erika Ford, who thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.
