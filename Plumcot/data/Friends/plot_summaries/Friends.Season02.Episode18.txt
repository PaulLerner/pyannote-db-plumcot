Joey's soap opera character is killed off after he brags in an interview that he writes his own lines. Chandler is unnerved by Eddie's strange behavior, while Ross and Rachel compare their past lovers as do Richard and Monica.
Chandler finds out Eddie is not only much less fun then Joey, but positively crazy and frighteningly suspicious and inconsistent. Ross is stressing out to learn Rachel had 'animal sex' with Paolo; Richard and Monica are uncomfortable to learn she is only his second lover, he the last in a long row; there's a logistical dilemma for both couples' make up-sex. After Joey told a TV digest he 'rewrites some of his dialogues', an insulted scenarist writes his character, Dr. Drake Ramoray, to fall to his death, ending his Days of Our Lives career.
Chandler trying to get to know Eddie backfires. Richard and Monica confess their number of past lovers while Rachel accidently makes Ross feel insecure about his sexual performance. Joey upsets the writers of his show and pays the consequence.
Joey's character on Days of our Lives, Dr. Drake Ramoray, has been killed off when an article in Soap Opera Digest reveals that Joey writes many of his lines. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Richard discuss their past lovers after Phoebe mentions that Monica has had many boyfriends.
