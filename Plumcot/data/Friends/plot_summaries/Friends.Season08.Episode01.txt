The gang learns that Rachel is pregnant; Joey tries to impress a Broadway director who's dating Chandler's mom; Chandler's shoes make it hard for him to dance.
Bride Monica emphatically denies the rumor of her pregnancy, which has even reached Ross. Rachel frantically fears and refuses to tell the truth, so Phoebe pretends to be the mother-to-be. But when she remembers that she shouldn't be drinking alcohol and spits out champagne, Monica guesses the truth. Ordered to change from his World War I uniform costume, Joey can only find a white tennis outfit to wear. Ross sees an attractive guest and changes the seating arrangement to sit with her, but mixes up table numbers 6 and 9, landing instead at the kids' table, on a chair which makes funny noises. His 'date' is nonetheless impressed by his kindness to kids, as he lets little girls dance while standing on his shoes, but his last partner is built less like an angel.
