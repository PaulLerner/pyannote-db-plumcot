Ross mistakenly thinks that Elizabeth wants to go on a trip with him and is very relieved when she only wants to tell him that she's going on Spring vacation with her friends. But when Ross realizes that she is going to party a lot and probably meet other guys he freaks out. Rachel is really upset about the competition between Monica/Chandler and Phoebe about her date for the ball so she decides to go alone and has a great time.
