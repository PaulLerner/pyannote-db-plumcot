As Carol goes into labor; Ross and Susan argue, Rachel flirts with Carol's doctor, and Joey assists a pregnant single mother.
When Ross' ex wife Carol is rushed to the hospital to have their baby, all the friends come along, but prove less then helpful. Rachel only has eyes for the unmarried obstetrician; Chandler and Monica worry if time is passing by for them to find partners and become parents. When Joey has an argument with a single pregnant woman, he finds himself the only available birth coach. After Carol throws Ross and her lesbian life-partner Susan out for bickering, Phoebe manages, while lecturing the pair, to lock all three of them in a janitorial closet.
