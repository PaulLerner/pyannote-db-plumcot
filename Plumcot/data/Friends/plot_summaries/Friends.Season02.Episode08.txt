With help from Chandler and Joey, Ross makes a list of pros and cons to decide whether to be with Julie or Rachel. Meanwhile, Monica gets a job making dessert with a disgusting synthetic chocolate substitute.
Rachel tells Phoebe and Monica, Ross tells Chandler and Joey about their kiss. Ross doesn't know what he's doing because he can't figure out whether to be with Julie or Rachel. Everyone (including Julie) is at Central Perk and Phoebe sings a song about their love triangle. Monica gets a new job making up recipes for a synthetic chocolate substitute. Chandler, Joey and Ross make a list with Julie and Rachel's pros and cons to make it easier for Ross to pick one of them. Monica makes Phoebe and Rachel try her terrible Mockolate recipes. Ross breaks up with Julie and Rachel is very happy but she sees the list they wrote and is not exactly happy... they argue and Rachel doesn't want to be with Ross anymore. Ross gives everything to win Rachel back.
