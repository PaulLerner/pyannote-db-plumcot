Rachel surprises Ross at the airport on his return from China, but he has brought a new girlfriend. Chandler feels guilty for having advised him to forget Rachel, who in turn rebounds - to the others' astonishment - to the infamous Paolo. When Monica convinces Phoebe to cut her hair after her good job on the boys, she's horrified to get the haircut of an entirely wrong movie star named Moore. Meanwhile, Joey's family tailor proves a bad recommendation to Chandler, who is not gullible enough to believe taking measurements for trousers requires taking the tape up each leg and the rear with intimate manual contact at groin height.
While Ross is in China, Chandler lets Rachel know that Ross is in love with her. Rachel goes to meet Ross at the airport when he gets back, but Ross found a girlfriend (Julie) in China. Rachel is mad at Chandler for telling her about Ross loving her. Ross tells Chandler he let go of Rachel because Chandler told him it would never happen. Ross and Julie have a great time together, and it's killing Rachel. Monica and Julie get along. Phoebe gives Monica an atrocious haircut. Rachel tells Ross that she isn't back together with Paolo.
