Rachel has an awkward encounter with Joshua's parents. Phoebe is offered the chance to name one of the triplets. Ross becomes paranoid when Emily goes to London with Susan.
Frank and Alice name two of the babies and let Phoebe pick a name for the second boy. Phoebe wavers between the names "Chandler" or "Joey", so the guys have a big competition whose name will be be picked. Ross freaks out because Susan is in London and is now really good friends with Emily - and it all seems too familiar. Rachel has a romantic date with Joshua and hopes to sleep with him. They are at Joshua's parents' place who are supposed to be on holidays, but come back unexpectedly. When they barge in, Rachel is wearing a sexy negligee and tells them it's a dress by an Italian designer. The parents are shocked but take Rachel and Joshua out for dinner with Rachel wearing her negligee. Ross seriously thinks Emily is a lesbian now too, but the friends tell him not to be so paranoid and he shouldn't let what happened with Carol ruin his relationship to Emily.
