Monica struggles to support Pete in his goal to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion. Chandler is uneasy when his boss playfully slaps his butt. Rachel becomes jealous when Ross starts dating a woman that was introduced to him by Phoebe.
Chandler is greatly appreciated by his boisterous boss Doug, but finds it unsettling to receive the highest praise in the form of systematical swatting of his posterior, to the point of its pain and his colleagues' envy. Millionaire Pete chooses as his new challenge after business to 'conquer' the brutal martial art of Ultimate Fighting, but despite an expensive entourage his confidence is so obviously and utterly misplaced that Monica can't watch his physical pain and public humiliation, even makes a breaking point of his persistence. Rachel gives her blessing to Phoebe presenting Ross with her friend Bonnie as date, without realizing she's no longer bald.
