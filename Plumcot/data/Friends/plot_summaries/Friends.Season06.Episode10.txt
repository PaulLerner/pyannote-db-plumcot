On the set of "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve", Joey tries to kiss Janine at midnight and Monica and Ross resurrect their dance routine from high school. Meanwhile, Rachel, Phoebe and Chandler look for Monica's Christmas presents.
Janine is going to be a party person in a New Year's Eve TV broadcast and asks Joey, Monica and Ross to come along for the taping. Rachel, Phoebe and Chandler look for the gifts Monica got for them while the others are at the taping. Monica and Ross really want to be on TV but they would have to dance on the platform which only the selected people can. They put on the "routine" - a dance they did in primary school - for the selection guy and they get to dance on the platform. Joey wanted to kiss Janine on the fake midnight but missed his chance. When they get back home Janine kisses Joey.
