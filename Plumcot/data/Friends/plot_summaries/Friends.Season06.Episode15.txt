When Rachel hears Barry and Mindy are getting divorced, the gang wonder how different their lives could have been.
After Rachel finds out that Barry (her ex-fianc√©) & Mindy (her ex-best friend) were getting divorced, the friends imagine what life would be like if: *Ross was still married to Carol, *Rachel had married Barry. *Phoebe had taken a job offer at 'Meryl Lynch' *Chandler had quit his job & wrote stories for 'The Newyorker'. *Joey was still on 'Days of our lives' & *Monica was still fat. ...
The friends fantasize about what their lives could have been like if Rachel had married Barry, Monica was still fat, Phoebe had accepted a certain job offer, Joey was still on "Days of Our Lives", Chandler had quit his job to become and cartoonist and Ross hadn't divorced Carol.
The Group of 6 imagine what could have been, if something in their lives had been different. For Ross, it's if he hadn't realized Carol was a lesbian, if Monica was still fat, if Rachel had married Barry, if Chandler had decided to be a comic, and if Joey was still on Days of our Lives. This is Part one of the duo episodes.
