Monica cooks a gourmet meal for a restaurateur who is looking for a new chef, however he arrives at the apartment stoned. Meanwhile, Ross tries to master 'dirty talk'.
Chandler has news: his boss offered him a promotion to data processing coordinator. So Chandler resigned! He has spent five years in what was meant to be a 'temporary' job and feels he is destined for something more meaningful than 'worrying about the 'weenus.' But he doesn't know what! After a full day of aptitude tests, Chandler is declared perfectly fit for data processing. He refuses to believe it, but his boss keeps making better and better offers. A massage client of Phoebe's is opening a restaurant, just the kind Monica would like to run, so she sets up a demonstration to impress the boss, Steve. Alas he arrives under the influence of weed, which makes him a voracious, infantile omnivore. Meanwhile Ross has a promising date with the museum's Insects curator and introduces her to his monkey Marcel.
