The gang remember the events three years ago, when several of them almost slept together.
After Janice asks about past relationships between the friends, we go back three years earlier. Phoebe and Monica live together, but Phoebe is moving out - without Monica knowing. Chandler is looking for a roommate, but his first choice, a photographer who works with models, is frightened away by Mr. Heckles, so Joey moves in instead. It turns out that living with Joey isn't that bad after all, and Monica fancies him, leading Joey to get naked in her apartment. Rachel is engaged to Barry, but she wants one last meaningless relationship, and Chandler is just the man she needs. Ross is happy his wife finally has a friend, until he finds out they are lesbians. Phoebe consoles him, and they almost sleep together.
