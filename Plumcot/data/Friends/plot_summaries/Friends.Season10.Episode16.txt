The gang throws Rachel a goodbye party, during which she says goodbye to everybody individually.
As Rachel prepares to move to Paris, Monica throws a going-away party for her. Rachel privately talks to everyone during the party except for Ross. Ross gets upset, and tells her that he at least deserves a goodbye because of their history. Rachel goes over his apartment, and tells him the reason she did not say goodbye was because it was too hard. That he was more important to her than the others. Then they share a romantic kiss. Meanwhile, Joey and Chandler are putting packing around their head, and hitting each other. Chandler finds handcuffs in the guest room, and assumes they are Monica's, Phoebe's, or Rachel's. They turn out to be Monica and Ross's grandma's handcuffs.
