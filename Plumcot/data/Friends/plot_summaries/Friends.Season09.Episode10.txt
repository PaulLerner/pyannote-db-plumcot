After reminiscing about Christmases spent with the Friends, he sends everyone home anyway. Only the second in the hierarchy, Wendy, stays. Monica gets jealous when she calls Chandler, and also starts reminiscing about romance with Chandler, who ends up making a snap decision of surprising magnitude...
