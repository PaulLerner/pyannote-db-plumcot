As Rachel interviews for a new job, the girls take on the guys in a game of poker.
Although Rachel failed to properly proofread her xeroxed resumes she does get an interview for her professional dream coming true as an assistant buyer. Meanwhile Phoebe's baseless feminist suspicion that the boys' poker night is somehow a macho conspiracy leads to the girls insisting to participate. Teaching them poker rules is like explaining rocket science to Joey, so the girls loose crushingly. Competitive Monica demands a rematch, after advanced lessons from her experienced aunt Iris. Finally, it comes down to a duel between Ross and Rachel, but she gets a call first: the buyer job fell through.
