Monica and Phoebe throw Rachel a baby shower but forget to invite Rachel's mom. Rachel realizes she has no idea how to look after the baby after the birth. Meanwhile, Joey auditions for a job as a host for a new game show called "Bamboozled", and Chandler and Ross help him practice.
Monica throws a baby shower for Rachel, but realizes she forgot to invite Rachel's mom and calls her just hours before it begins. The party is nice and everything goes well, until Phoebe tells Monica that there will be a stripper. Meanwhile, Joey is practicing for an audition to become the host of a new game show named "Bamboozled". Ross and Chandler invite Joey to play basketball, but he needs to practice for the casting and asks for some help. Chandler gets very uncomfortable, because he feels like a fool pretending to be a contestant - especially given the show's ridiculous format and rules - while Ross is enjoying it. Monica gets nervous, because Rachel's mother is still irritated about the last-minute invitation and brushes off Monica's apologies. Mrs. Green tells Rachel that she will move in with her for eight weeks when the baby comes, but Rachel doesn't like the idea and claims that she will be able to manage everything because has read some books. But when she opens her presents and sees all the strange items for a newborn, she freaks out and concludes that she indeed will need her mother's help.
