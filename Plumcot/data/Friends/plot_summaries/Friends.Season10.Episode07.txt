Monica and Chandler nervously prepare for a visit from an adoption worker. Phoebe and Mike keep changing their minds about donating their wedding money to charity. Ross fights Rachel's fear of swings.
Ross refuses to allow Rachel to pass on her irrational fear of playground swings to their daughter since her hair got caught in one and, 'far worse,' had to be cut off unevenly. He takes them both to the park where he has to face his fear of spiders in exchange for getting Rachel to try a swing after seeing Emma enjoy it. Monica thoroughly clears away everything that might scare off Laura, the social worker from the adoption agency, but Joey, who promised to turn up in case she's impressed by a TV 'celebrity', once dated Laura and never called back as he always falsely promises - Meanwhile, after trying on Monica's veil, Phoebe changes her mind about having donating her wedding day budget to the New York Children's Fund and so drags fiance Mike along to seduce the foundation's clerk, who she supposes is gay, to convince him into refunding, then feels guilty again.
