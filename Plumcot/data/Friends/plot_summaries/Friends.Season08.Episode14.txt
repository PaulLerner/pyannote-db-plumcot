Chandler's very curious about a locked closet, but Monica won't tell him what is inside.
Chandler discovers that there is one closet in their apartment that has never been opened. Monica claims that there's nothing important inside, only "feminine stuff". Chandler has his doubts about it, and he even thinks that Richard, Monica's ex boyfriend, is locked inside. Meanwhile, Rachel is having contractions and Joey takes her to the hospital. Ross begins to feel that he is missing all the good things about Rachel's pregnancy. Joey, who continues to fight with his feelings about Rachel, finds out about Ross's situation, and tells to Rachel she should move in with Ross. Monica asks Phoebe for a massage, but they'll find themselves in a very uncomfortable situation, when Phoebe discovers the "sexual sounds" that Monica makes during the session. Later, Chandler finally opens the closet and finds out that Monica has her own "chaotic space", as all obsessive-compulsive people do.
