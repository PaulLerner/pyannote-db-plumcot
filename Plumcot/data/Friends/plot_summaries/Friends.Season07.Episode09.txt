When Monica wants to get to know her neighbors, she decides to make candy, but when the neighbors want candy 24/7, she becomes overwhelmed. When Rachel makes a fake but inappropriate evaluation of Tag, she gets angry with him when he fails to read it and sends it to Human Resources. With the help of Ross, Phoebe learns to ride a bike.
Monica makes candy for their neighbors even though they don't know them. The neighbors love the candy and Monica becomes very popular in the building. Rachel and Tag try to hide their relationship at work but when Rachel writes a revealing evaluation as a joke and Tag sends it on to human resources without reading it, they have a problem. Ross finds out that Phoebe never owned a bike so he buys her the prettiest pink bike there is and teaches Phoebe how to ride. Tag and Rachel almost get fired but manage to solve the problem. Tons of people hang around the apartment waiting for more of Monica's candy so Chandler stands up for Monica and tells everyone to go away and leave her alone. Ross buys Phoebe training wheels.
