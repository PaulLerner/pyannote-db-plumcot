chandler_bing Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
monica_geller We could, or we can have sex in it.
chandler_bing Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
monica_geller Okay mister! Fertilize me!
monica_geller Does that sound like Janice?
chandler_bing If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hi.
rachel_green Oh hi.
monica_geller I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
rachel_green Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
chandler_bing Weirdest thing. Did I hear--Mother of God it's true!
janice Chandler Bing!
chandler_bing Jan-Janice!
dr_ross_geller Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
janice Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
chandler_bing Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
janice It's you. This is yours.
chandler_bing What?!
janice Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
chandler_bing That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
phoebe_buffay Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
cliff I'd have to say...the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you're making me eat him.
phoebe_buffay Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
cliff No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'll get it.
cliff Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
phoebe_buffay Relax, it's not like we're forking.
rachel_green Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
dr_ross_geller Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
rachel_green Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
dr_long Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
rachel_green Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
dr_long Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
rachel_green What?
dr_long Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom.
rachel_green My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
cliff Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
phoebe_buffay Y'know what? This one is.
cliff Oh my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before!
phoebe_buffay Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
cliff I'm telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
phoebe_buffay Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
joey_tribbiani Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
cliff That-that's him! You know him?
phoebe_buffay Okay. Okay. I-Okay umm...this...I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
cliff I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
joey_tribbiani Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
cliff And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
phoebe_buffay You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
cliff I don't think so.
joey_tribbiani Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
phoebe_buffay Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
joey_tribbiani Right!
phoebe_buffay Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
cliff It doesn't happen to me either.
joey_tribbiani Me neither.
dr_long Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5...4
rachel_green 3-2-1 oh!!
dr_long Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
rachel_green I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't.
dr_ross_geller Sweetie you're doing great.
rachel_green Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
dr_long Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
dr_ross_geller What? You do? You do? Oh my God!
rachel_green Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
dr_ross_geller What is that?
dr_long It's the baby's buttock, she's breech.
dr_ross_geller Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
rachel_green Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
dr_long She's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
dr_ross_geller Go!
dr_long Rachel you're gonna have to push even harder, nothing's happening!
rachel_green I'm sorry, I can't!
dr_ross_geller Yes you can!
rachel_green I can't!
dr_ross_geller Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!
rachel_green I can't. Please, you do it for me.
dr_ross_geller No! Come on let's-One more time! One final push! Ready? 1...2...3!
dr_long Good!
dr_ross_geller Keep pushing!
rachel_green Are you okay?
dr_ross_geller You have no idea how much this hurts. Keep going! Keep going!
dr_long Here we go!
dr_ross_geller Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
rachel_green Oh God!
dr_ross_geller Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she's here.
dr_ross_geller Oh she's...she's perfect.
rachel_green Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?
dr_ross_geller Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
rachel_green Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
dr_long Here she is!
rachel_green Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.
dr_long Do we have a name yet?
rachel_green No, not yet.
dr_long That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
rachel_green Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
rachel_green Hello baby girl.
phoebe_buffay Can we come in?
dr_ross_geller Oh, come in.
phoebe_buffay Hi!
joey_tribbiani There she is!
phoebe_buffay Oh, she's so beautiful.
rachel_green Here.
monica_geller Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
chandler_bing It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
joey_tribbiani She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and...uh-oh.
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.
phoebe_buffay Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't.
monica_geller What's the matter?
rachel_green Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
dr_ross_geller The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
rachel_green So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.
joey_tribbiani What's the matter now?
rachel_green I was reliving it.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh.
chandler_bing So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
phoebe_buffay Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
dr_ross_geller Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.
rachel_green Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
dr_ross_geller Wow! Umm, okay uh...everyone...this...is Isabella. What?
rachel_green That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
chandler_bing So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
joey_tribbiani What was the other one Ross?
dr_ross_geller Umm, Delilah.
rachel_green Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
dr_ross_geller So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl.
phoebe_buffay Yay!
rachel_green Well what are we going to do?
monica_geller It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
dr_ross_geller Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
chandler_bing You do?
monica_geller Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
chandler_bing Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?
rachel_green Well tell us! What are they?
monica_geller Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
rachel_green And if it's a girl?
monica_geller I don't want to say.
rachel_green Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
monica_geller Okay. It's Emma.
rachel_green Emma! See? I don't want it.
monica_geller Take it.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller It's clearly an Emma.
rachel_green Oh honey, but you love that name.
monica_geller Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean... Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!
chandler_bing That was amazing.
monica_geller I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
chandler_bing And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
janice Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
rachel_green Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
janice He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
rachel_green Oh, I'm fine.
janice Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.
rachel_green Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
janice Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
rachel_green Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
janice I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.
rachel_green Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.
janice Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
rachel_green Really?
janice I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own.
rachel_green Well... That's...y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the...the beginning of something.
dr_ross_geller Hey Janice!
janice Oh hi!
dr_ross_geller Who's this little guy?
janice Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
dr_ross_geller No-no. No.
janice I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
janice Bye.
dr_ross_geller Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
rachel_green Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
dr_ross_geller Huh?
rachel_green Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...we can't let that happen again, y'know?
rachel_green Right.
dr_ross_geller I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?
rachel_green No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
rachel_green That's all right. And so it begins.
phoebe_buffay Is she in there?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
dr_ross_geller Look at Emma!
phoebe_buffay I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
dr_ross_geller Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
dr_ross_geller It's...it's complicated okay?
phoebe_buffay Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
dr_ross_geller Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
phoebe_buffay I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, exactly.
phoebe_buffay Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
joey_tribbiani Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
rachel_green Nothing.
joey_tribbiani What is it? Hey!
rachel_green Really it's nothing. I'm just
joey_tribbiani Rach come on, what?
rachel_green I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
joey_tribbiani What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
rachel_green Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
joey_tribbiani Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
rachel_green I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I guess so.
rachel_green I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
joey_tribbiani Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
rachel_green Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
joey_tribbiani You don't have to worry about that okay?
rachel_green Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.
joey_tribbiani Sure.
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani My God.
rachel_green Joey.
rachel_green Oh my God. Okay.
