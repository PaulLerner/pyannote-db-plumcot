It's a tradition here on Friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys, talk down the episode umm... The point of this whole thing is what people see in America is: they see Friends, they love the show, it looks like a smooth running machine, but behind the scenes there's deceit, mistrust, and hate. And I thought, I thought we'd actually take a look at uh, y'know some of these moments where you guys are-there are mistakes. You make mistakes.
Once and a while.
From time to time.
For example, I don't have to memorize lines. You guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?
Our energy just comes way up when there's an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn't, it just doesn't work.
Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn't. I did.
Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.
So, we realize that-Oh no... I'm telling it! I'm telling it
Ha-ha. Look-Come on, I don't know what to do...or say.
Ha-ha, very funny. I don't know what to do! Y'know? Holy crud!
Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don't know what to do!
It is one of those days!
'Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay--uck it!
Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?
You still get nervous everybody just before a show?
Absolutely.
Everybody.
It's amazing like all week long we've-we've been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once, then you'll get nervous because you'll-you know you'll probably mess up again.
Action!
When you were little you slept through-through the Grand Canyon.
Watch again that hand.
This'll be five/ten takes.
Okay.
Okay. You know it's gonna happen.
Once again, and action!
When-when you were little you slept through the Grand Canyon.
Oh! Okay! I'm gonna try it without the coffee cup 'cause I think it's the left hand that's messing me up.
When you were little you slept through the Grand--Oh fffff....
Sorry, let's go back! 'Cause you've got more to say.
Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that's your fault. I...say.
I love you.
I love you!
But there must be, there must-are a lot of moments over the years where you're just trying to do your job, something goes wrong.
Hey and, this is a little extra something for y'know, always being there for me.
Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!
What?!
Ahh! Sh--it that hurt!
Are you okay?
Hey Rach!
Oh yeah? Then how come I keep-
It was so wild! We told 'em we were the Gunderson's in 16
I spit on her!
Operation. You had a fun one.
Oh yeah!
With Operation.
It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer.
Oh-ooh, and I brought Operation, but umm I lost the umm... It's making a noise.
But le Blanc really doesn't mess up much.
You don't verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up.
I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call 'em.
He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And he--he was afraid he was gonna fall down
You could actually see him trying not to fall down.
Pheebs! Check it out!
This particular time when he continued to fall or y'know, try not to fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?"
Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out!
Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something's naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?
I don't necessarily like to juice things
He said true or false!
Oh! Ooh-ooh!
What are you doing?!
You're still a tiny bit on fire there.
Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
It was great seeing you the other night.
Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
What the fu--ck are you doing?!
Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a monkey
That damn monkey.
That damn monkey.
Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That's Dr. Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There--Okay.
Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here-Katie! Katie, come here Katie. Very good.
Lisa's laugh though...There's-It's so infectious. It's one of those things...just forget about it. Once it starts, it's all gone.
No y'know, I don't want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
Well at Monica's you can eat-
Okay, shh yeah. 'Cause it's not silly.
Here we go.
Okay.
And...action!
No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph
Ready?
Yeah.
And then it just builds on itself and there's no doing the scene after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.
For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when-I mean when
You bastard.
Yeah, what did I do?
...I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, I-I-I mean I find it so funny.
Mornin'
Mornin'
I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"
That's a good one?
Now, we should go back and take the other line.
Okay, I'll just put a little more booze on there.
I think, subconsciously
Nope, you lost me.
No! Come on!
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. I'll be Monica. Go!
No! No! No!
We'll be right back with more Friends, less me.
I'm doing my brother.
That's...gross.
You uh, you've worked with-They always say a performer should never work with pets or children.
Aww, the kids.
Action.
Okay. Now-What is my first line?
What did we agree?
Okay
The good thing about the young kids though, they're completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story
Oh little Ben.
Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to hear my son's first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn't supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show
Hi! We're visiting!
Yay!
It's Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y'know, you might as well say it because I told your
Da...Da.
Can you say Da-Da? See, I'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try
Da...Da.
Huh?
Da...Da.
Yeah, he's saying Da-Da.
And then sometimes during the show y'know but you're like, the scene's going one way but you're just tempted to say something another time. Like, do you remember that one where Monica's baking cookies in our old apartment?
She's trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.
Yeah, she's trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place, and we're sitting there eating pizza and I think it was you that said
What do I smell?
I think I was supposed to say, "I don't know," and go over and open the door. And I went
What do I smell?
Sorry.
And then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face.
What do I smell?
Le Blanc.
What do I smell?
I don't know, but it smells good.
But audiences-You have a live studio audience and they must love that. They must love it when they see you guys playing.
What are you guys doing?
Nothing.
Nothin'.
So that you will intentionally do something that-they'll-they'll intentionally screw it up?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Why? What's the matter?
You-you've worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot of people love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?
I'm melting!
They made me dance, in the fat suit.
I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes there's just a word that someone has to say that you'll get hung up on. And it'll just-the way you say the word is funny to everybody else.
That tastes like feet!
It tastes like feet!
Okay, we're good.
Action!
That tastes like feet!
Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and you'll-we'll be rehearsing during the week and you just-whatever-whatever the joke is; it's so funny we can't get through it in rehearsal and just
You just know.
You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night, I'm just-I'll never be able to get through this."
Are you saying that you don't want to get with this?
You see, I don't say-
Oh, sweet Je--sus! Oh! Monica, these are the cookies they serve in hell!
Whoa! She's purty!
Oh yeah, and she's really nice too! She taught me about y'know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
Joey?
I'm sorry
Excuse me, what?
When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene.
Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a stair-a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably...I-I think it was the hardest I've-I've laughed in my life period.
Pivot! Pivot! Okay, pivot! Piv-at!
Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Pivat!! Pivat!!!
You've done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80 years from now you'll be thinking about?
It is when we're able to crack each other up.
Monica's gotta have the phone in the right place and-
All right! All right! All right! We are fixing it.
He's gone. He's
We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each other's performance, and we like each other.
Oh the band's ready! And well-I-I-we gotta do what the band says, right? I don't care about the stinkin' band!!
Okay Friends gang, thanks for doing it.
Well thank you so much.
Thank you Conan!
Well thank for coming here, it's good to see you.
Thank you my babies.
Oh what are doing?!
You're still a tiny bit on fire there!
I think you got it!
I'm sorry, I messed up.
I'll do it again and again if you want.
No-no! I'll-I'll
That is too much!
Let me start that again.
