[dr_ross_geller] All right! Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
[rachel_green] Yes, the hard part is truly over.
[dr_ross_geller] No, but come on, we're off to a great start aren't we? I knew I'd get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!
[phoebe_buffay] Oh you made it!
[rachel_green] Hi!
[monica_geller] How are you doing?
[dr_ross_geller] Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
[monica_geller] We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
[dr_ross_geller] N... No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!
[chandler_bing] Hi!
[joey_tribbiani] Hey! You made it!
[dr_ross_geller] Okay is there...some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!
[rachel_green] Ross, you stay here and talk, I'm gonna go have a baby.
[dr_ross_geller] Okay. Okay. Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I'm Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.
[nurse_1] Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute
[rachel_green] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I'm sorry, semi-private? We , we asked for a private room.
[nurse_1] Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can't guarantee a private room and currently they're all unavailable.
[chandler_bing] Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
[nurse_1] I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
[rachel_green] Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
[dr_ross_geller] Yeah?
[rachel_green] Give her some money.
[dr_ross_geller] I really think they're out of rooms.
[rachel_green] They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
[dr_ross_geller] Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm... Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up?
[nurse_1] This is a hospital.
[rachel_green] Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to-Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
[dr_ross_geller] What-what?
[rachel_green] Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
[nurse_1] Would you like to see a semi-private room?
[rachel_green] Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
[dr_long] Well you're only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to ten. It'll be a while.
[rachel_green] Oh, okay.
[dr_long] I'll be back in an hour to check you again.
[dr_ross_geller] Thank you.
[rachel_green] Thank you. Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
[dr_ross_geller] Yeah, guess so. Whew! Check these out! Never done this before.
[rachel_green] Yeah well it looks great!
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Thank you very much.
[woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Thanks.
[dr_ross_geller] Hi! Hi, I'm uh Ross. I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Oh no-no, not at all.
[woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Don't worry about it.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Marc Coreger, this is my wife Julie.

[rachel_green] How are you?
[julie] Hi. Is this your first?
[rachel_green] Yeah it is.
[julie] Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.
[rachel_green] That's so sweet.
[dr_ross_geller] Yeah.
[rachel_green] Oh.
[dr_ross_geller] Umm say, I-I opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy.
[marc] No nonsense! We're all in this together.
[julie] Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think we're gonna have some fun.
[marc] Yeah.
[dr_ross_geller] Oh, okay.
[marc] Hey! Smile!
[rachel_green] Oh no, I really don't want any--Oh! Thank you. Oh. Oh Ross
[dr_ross_geller] What?
[rachel_green] Here comes another contraction.
[dr_ross_geller] Oh. Okay, just breathe.
[julie] Oh honey, I think I'm having one too!
[marc] Look at this! There we go!
[phoebe_buffay] Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
[monica_geller] Hey, you wanna see something?
[phoebe_buffay] Sure! What?
[monica_geller] Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
[chandler_bing] Yeah?
[monica_geller] Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
[chandler_bing] Okay.
[monica_geller] What-what-what's that now?!
[chandler_bing] Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
[monica_geller] What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
[phoebe_buffay] Oh, this is fun.
[joey_tribbiani] You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
[chandler_bing] But you said you were ready too.
[monica_geller] Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
[chandler_bing] Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
[monica_geller] Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. 'Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
[joey_tribbiani] What?! Are you crazy?!
[monica_geller] That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
[marc] I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
[rachel_green] Oh, that's very-Really very-very okay.
[marc] Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
[julie] Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
[rachel_green] No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
[dr_ross_geller] We're not gonna do that.
[julie] Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.
[judy_geller] Am I interrupting?
[dr_ross_geller] Uh yes! Thank you.
[rachel_green] Oh. Oh wait no.
[dr_ross_geller] Later.
[rachel_green] No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
[dr_ross_geller] Oh uh, I'm sorry.
[rachel_green] No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
[dr_ross_geller] Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I-I wished you'd called first.
[judy_geller] Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
[dr_ross_geller] Oh good.
[judy_geller] I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
[dr_ross_geller] Okay, what's up?
[judy_geller] I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
[dr_ross_geller] Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
[judy_geller] This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
[dr_ross_geller] Mom no, come on! Thank you.
[judy_geller] Just hear me out!
[dr_ross_geller] N-no! Okay? We've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
[judy_geller] Honestly! Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
[dr_ross_geller] Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry
[judy_geller] Just...think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
[dr_ross_geller] Gimmie!
[rachel_green] Hi!
[judy_geller] Oh hi dear!
[rachel_green] Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
[dr_ross_geller] ...she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
[phoebe_buffay] Yeah. Why aren't you with Rachel?
[dr_ross_geller] Are you kidding? Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
[phoebe_buffay] But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
[dr_ross_geller] Okay, stop it! I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
[phoebe_buffay] Right. And with who again?
[joey_tribbiani] God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
[phoebe_buffay] I know!
[joey_tribbiani] I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and... I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
[dr_ross_geller] Hey. Who's that?
[rachel_green] New people.
[dr_ross_geller] What happened to the Disgustingtons?
[rachel_green] They're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
[dr_ross_geller] Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
[rachel_green] Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
[dr_ross_geller] Yeah? Okay.
[rachel_green] Ooh! Ow!!
[evil_bitch] Are you looking at her?!
[sick_bastard] No!
[evil_bitch] Don't you look at her you sick bastard!
[sick_bastard] Honey I swear! I wasn't looking at her!
[evil_bitch] She's in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
[dr_ross_geller] Umm. Umm, I'm-I'm just gonna-
[evil_bitch] See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
[dr_ross_geller] No-no, I'm...I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
[evil_bitch] You miss your girlfriend?
[dr_ross_geller] Just ignore them.
[rachel_green] Ross.
[dr_ross_geller] What? What?
[rachel_green] He's looking at me.
[dr_ross_geller] Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
[evil_bitch] Don't you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
[monica_geller] Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
[monica_geller] What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
[chandler_bing] I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
[monica_geller] What?
[chandler_bing] Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
[monica_geller] We are pretty good.
[chandler_bing] But nothing has to happen until your ready.
[monica_geller] Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
[chandler_bing] What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
[monica_geller] What?!!
[chandler_bing] I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
[monica_geller] So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
[chandler_bing] We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
[monica_geller] Okay, hold on a sec.
[chandler_bing] Period math?
[monica_geller] Yeah.
[chandler_bing] Yeah.
[monica_geller] Well, we could start trying. Now.
[chandler_bing] Right here?
[monica_geller] No, not here. Maybe here.
[chandler_bing] Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
[monica_geller] And it's so clean!!
[joey_tribbiani] Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
[phoebe_buffay] Oh, it ate your money?
[joey_tribbiani] No.
[phoebe_buffay] All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
[joey_tribbiani] All right.
[phoebe_buffay] All right.
[joey_tribbiani] Hey I got one! I got one!
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Hi!
[phoebe_buffay] Hi.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Oh uh, up or down?
[phoebe_buffay] Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Could you press up too please?
[phoebe_buffay] Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?
[phoebe_buffay] Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Car accident.
[phoebe_buffay] Oh.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Yeah. Me. Oh hey, that's me. Hey uh, I take it you're just visiting someone.
[phoebe_buffay] Uh-huh, yeah.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Well umm, if you have sometime y'know and maybe you might want to visit someone else
[phoebe_buffay] Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] I'm in the middle
[phoebe_buffay] Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
[joey_tribbiani] Uh, you gotta press the button.
[dr_ross_geller] The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
[rachel_green] Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
[dr_ross_geller] That's it. That's it.
[woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
[rachel_green] Yeah it was.
[woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Mine haven't been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. Oh, that was a big one!
[phoebe_buffay] Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
[nurse_1] I think I know who you're talking about.
[phoebe_buffay] Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
[nurse_1] I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
[joey_tribbiani] Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
[nurse_1] Dr. Drake who?
[joey_tribbiani] Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
[nurse_1] A doctor at this hospital?
[joey_tribbiani] Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
[phoebe_buffay] Hands.
[joey_tribbiani] Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
[nurse_1] He's in room 816.
[joey_tribbiani] 816, thank you!
[phoebe_buffay] Thank you.
[joey_tribbiani] And what is his name?
[phoebe_buffay] No!
[monica_geller] I think we found a place.
[chandler_bing] Okay.
[monica_geller] Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
[chandler_bing] Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.
[monica_geller] Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
[monica_geller] Okay. Let's hurry-Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
[chandler_bing] Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
[phoebe_buffay] Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
[joey_tribbiani] Great! Go get him.
[phoebe_buffay] Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
[joey_tribbiani] He's not really my type.
[phoebe_buffay] No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.
[joey_tribbiani] But you said he was this great guy!
[phoebe_buffay] But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
[joey_tribbiani] You do attract some stinkers.
[rachel_green] Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
[dr_long] Three.
[dr_ross_geller] Just three?! I'm dilated three!
[dr_long] We are moving along, just slowly. Don't worry, you're doing great. I'll be back soon.
[rachel_green] Hey, y'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this!
[dr_ross_geller] Actually it's more like this.
[rachel_green] Oh stupid metric system!
[doctor] Oh my. We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
[rachel_green] Oh for the love of God!
[woman_giving_birth] It's coming! It's coming!
[doctor] And here it is!
[rachel_green] Oh come on!!
[joey_tribbiani] Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
[joey_tribbiani] I know, but I'm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Dr. Wells is a woman.
[joey_tribbiani] That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Clifford Burnett.
[joey_tribbiani] Date of birth?
[cliff] November 16th, 1968.
[joey_tribbiani] Age?
[cliff] Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth?
[joey_tribbiani] I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
[cliff] I'm 33.
[joey_tribbiani] Okay. And uh, are you married.
[cliff] No.
[joey_tribbiani] Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
[cliff] Are all the questions this personal?
[joey_tribbiani] Yes.
[cliff] Well uh if you must know I'm a widower.
[joey_tribbiani] Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
[cliff] Yeah.
[joey_tribbiani] Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
[cliff] No.
[joey_tribbiani] Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
[cliff] No!
[joey_tribbiani] Oooh, wrong answer.
[nurse_1] This room's available.
[rachel_green] Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband he's a lawyer!
[dr_ross_geller] Uh Rach
[rachel_green] Go get back on that case honey!
[nurse_1] I don't think the next patient is very far along.
[rachel_green] Okay, well then bring her in.
[woman#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] OH....MY....GAWD!!!
[janice] I....can't....believe this!
[dr_ross_geller] And yet somehow it's true!
[janice] I mean this is so great! We're gonna be baby buddies!
[dr_ross_geller] Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!
[man#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode23] Hi sweetie!
[janice] Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?
[sid] I still can't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!
[dr_ross_geller] Really?
[sid] What'd he say?
[janice] Oh y'know what? You have to speak very loudly when you're talking to Sid, because he's almost completely deaf.
[rachel_green] Oh!
[dr_ross_geller] Oh there you go!
[rachel_green] I get it!
[janice] So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
[rachel_green] Oh we-we didn't.
[dr_ross_geller] No-no. We
[janice] What?!
[dr_ross_geller] Um uh...We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.
[janice] Why?!!
[dr_ross_geller] Uh well umm...we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.
[janice] Oh. Well then shut me up.
[rachel_green] Just tell me how.
[janice] Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
[dr_ross_geller] Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
[phoebe_buffay] What else? What else?
[joey_tribbiani] Uh, well he's 33.
[phoebe_buffay] Oh. Ah-uh.
[joey_tribbiani] A widower.
[phoebe_buffay] Oh.
[joey_tribbiani] He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
[phoebe_buffay] Enter Pheebs.
