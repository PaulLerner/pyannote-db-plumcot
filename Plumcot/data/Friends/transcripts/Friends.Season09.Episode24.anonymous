Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
I know
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
The sun is out!
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Nooo!
Damn it!
Walls are pretty thin, guys!
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
Not to mention the cold sores.
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
Really?
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
What?
He said "erectus"!
You're... you're kidding, right?
No, he really said it.
.. and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
Erectus?
Homo.
.. in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
Oh, thanks guys!
Oh!
Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
Yeah!
It was really... great!
Oh, thank you so much!
Yeah, and so funny!
Oh!
Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
Oh... I'm back!
Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
Yeah!
Hey! Well...?
You were incredible!
Yeah?
You blew them away!
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
I was not!
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
Look, I took it too far!
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
So, what are we gonna do today?
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
I don't think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
I'm not always that bad!
Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
I punched you...?
And...?
.. Phoebe...?
.. and...?
I clunked your heads together!
Hey! There you are!
Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night...
Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
Yeah...
.. is it weird that it's not with each other?
Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
I think we need to talk...!
Yeah... I think we do..... about what?
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
But then how do we know who wins?
Nobody wins!
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
I'm not playing with you.
Yeah, I'm out.
I'll play ya!
OK!
Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
Sure! Got to!
Aww!
Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
Oh dear God, there's two of them!
You're ready to play?
Hell, yeah!
Did you know this about him?
No idea! I though he was soft like you!
Wanna make it more interesting?
How much were you thinking?
Ten bucks a game?
Make it fifty!
I'll make it a hundred!
One thousand...
OK!
To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Monica, you call it.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
Tails!
Ow, what are the chances!
Ha! My point!
Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
He was a lawyer!
.. all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
Oh! Weather bitch!
It's open! Hi, Joe!
Hey...
What, is everything ok?
Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Nooooo, why?
Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
Oh, that's crazy!
No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
.. yeah, it's true.
I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
What, hey!
Ok, Rach!
I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
You know? Forget it!
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Yeah, sure!
You like me?
Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
That's a huge thing!
Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
What... for how long?
Only like a month!
A MONTH??
What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
I just have one question!
Shoot!
What the hell are you doin'???
I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
Who...?
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Yeah, he had a paper route.
Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
But can it... just... happen a little bit?
NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
But why, why not?
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
It's not a big deal!
NO BIG DEAL!
It's so not a big deal!
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
Ok!
Ok, I...
AAAHHHH!
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
Do you?
Ah, yeah!
Do you?
Ah, yeaaah!
DO YOU?
AH YEAAAAH!
Do you really find this attractive on him?
Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
Oh, damn it!
I sleep with him!
Game, point!
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
NO, NO, NOOO!
And that's how it's done!
Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Best out of three?
That's what I'm thinking.
Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
Serve the ball, chump!
: Serve the ball, chump.
Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!
Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
Jarvis?
Oh, you're back... this is my wife, Nancy.
Get Out!
Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes, please! So, what's going on?
Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
I knew that was him!
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
Hey, you ok?
I guess. There was hum... there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone else.
Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both in now!
Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. GO, GO, GO!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
But...
Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
What about the obsessive cleaning?
That's just good sense!
Aww!
You ok?
No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!
So you forfeit?
Mike wins?
I can't believe it! I lost!
No, you didn't.
What?
Because I'm gonna play for ya.
You can't do that!
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
But... you suck!
You're welcome, sweetheart.
All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Ok!
Oh my God! You're good!
It's like watching porn!
And that's... how... it's done!
Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
Why?
I don't know.
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
That's why!
Thanks!
Hi.
Are they still looking for us?
Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
I don't think they saw us.
I don't think they did.
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
I think you know.
I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
I'm sorry... we... we can't.
All right, all right.
I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
What?
