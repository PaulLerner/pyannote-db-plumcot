housekeeper#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
phoebe_buffay This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
housekeeper#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode23 Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
