[monica_geller] Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
[phoebe_buffay] Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
[chandler_bing] Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
[monica_geller] Old?
[chandler_bing] The young hot ball and chain.
[monica_geller] That's much better.
[rachel_green] Op! We gotta go!
[dr_ross_geller] Oh, where are you guys going?
[monica_geller] We're gonna pick up the wedding dress then we're gonna have lunch with mom.
[dr_ross_geller] Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?
[joey_tribbiani] No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
[dr_ross_geller] Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
[chandler_bing] What's up?
[dr_ross_geller] Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
[chandler_bing] Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
[dr_ross_geller] No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
[chandler_bing] But you're still my friend?
[dr_ross_geller] Not for the next few minutes.
[chandler_bing] During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
[dr_ross_geller] Nope.
[chandler_bing] Do I still call you Ross?
[dr_ross_geller] Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
[chandler_bing] Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
[dr_ross_geller] No problem.
[chandler_bing] So are we...friends again?
[dr_ross_geller] Yeah.
[chandler_bing] Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
[rachel_green] What 'cha doing Mon?
[monica_geller] I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
[phoebe_buffay] What are they?
[monica_geller] Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
[rachel_green] Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
[monica_geller] I had to go with the odds Rach.
[joey_tribbiani] Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?

[joey_tribbiani] Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!
[richard_crosby] No I didn't.

[joey_tribbiani] What?!
[richard_crosby] The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
[joey_tribbiani] So what are we gonna do?! We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
[richard_crosby] No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
[the_director] Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
[joey_tribbiani] No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
[the_director] I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
[richard_crosby] We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
[monica_geller] Honey, we gotta go!
[chandler_bing] Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
[monica_geller] I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
[chandler_bing] Yes, include more people in this.
[monica_geller] Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?

[rachel_green] I said I'll do it!
[monica_geller] Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
[rachel_green] Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
[monica_geller] Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.

[monica_geller] Okay. Sorry.
[rachel_green] Ugh! What grandmother?
[joey_tribbiani] Hey! Where have you been?
[dr_ross_geller] Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
[joey_tribbiani] Oh.
[dr_ross_geller] What? Are you going back to work?
[joey_tribbiani] Yeah.
[dr_ross_geller] Nice shades.
[joey_tribbiani] Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
[dr_ross_geller] And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
[joey_tribbiani] Great! All right. I'll see you later.
[dr_ross_geller] Hey, where's Chandler?
[joey_tribbiani] Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
[dr_ross_geller] Chandler? Chandler?
[dr_ross_geller] Hey!
[rachel_green] Hi!
[dr_ross_geller] Is uh, is Monica here?
[rachel_green] She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
[dr_ross_geller] I think Chandler's gone.
[rachel_green] What?!
[dr_ross_geller] He left that.
[rachel_green] Tell Monica I'm sorry.
[phoebe_buffay] What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
[phoebe_buffay] Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
[rachel_green] Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
[phoebe_buffay] Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
[dr_ross_geller] I think it means he freaked out and left!
[phoebe_buffay] Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
[rachel_green] Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
[dr_ross_geller] Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
[rachel_green] Okay.
[phoebe_buffay] Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
[dr_ross_geller] I will, I will find him.
[richard_crosby] Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?

[richard_crosby] Oh, thanks.
[joey_tribbiani] But you're spittin' all over me man!
[richard_crosby] Well of course I am!

[dr_ross_geller] Why?!
[judy_geller] The sexy blonde behind the counter.
[dr_ross_geller] Gunther?!
[jack_geller] Your mother just added him to her list.
[dr_ross_geller] What? Your-your list?
[judy_geller] Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep
[dr_ross_geller] Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
[jack_geller] And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
[the_director] Action!
[richard_crosby] I found the picture!
[joey_tribbiani] What picture?!
[richard_crosby] The picture of my wife! In your pack!
[joey_tribbiani] You went through my personal property?
[richard_crosby] Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
[joey_tribbiani] Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
[the_director] Cut! Wonderful!
[joey_tribbiani] Great scene yeah?
[richard_crosby] Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
[joey_tribbiani] Thanks a lot.
[the_assistant_director] Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
[joey_tribbiani] Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
[the_assistant_director] You are now.
[joey_tribbiani] No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
[rachel_green] Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
[phoebe_buffay] Oh man.
[rachel_green] Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
[phoebe_buffay] Okay. Well there's one down.
[monica_geller] I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
[phoebe_buffay] Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
[monica_geller] I'm gonna start getting ready!
[rachel_green] God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown
[phoebe_buffay] Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
[rachel_green] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
[phoebe_buffay] Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
[rachel_green] I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
[phoebe_buffay] Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
[rachel_green] Oh!
[phoebe_buffay] No-no! I-I...I found one.
[rachel_green] Okay.
[rachel_green] Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
[phoebe_buffay] Sure. Do you need some floss?
[rachel_green] Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
[phoebe_buffay] Oh here's a whole bunch.
[rachel_green] Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
[phoebe_buffay] Oh my God!
[rachel_green] What?
[phoebe_buffay] There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
