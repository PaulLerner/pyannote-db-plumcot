Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes') power is growing stronger. He now has control over the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) decide to finish Dumbledore's (Sir Michael Gambon's) work and find the rest of the Horcruxes to defeat the Dark Lord. But little hope remains for the trio, and the rest of the Wizarding World, so everything they do must go as planned.
Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) begin their mission to find the Horcruxes, the keys to Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes') immortality, but nowhere is safe now that Voldemort has gained control over Hogwarts and the Wizarding World.
