old man Bloody kids.
wormtail Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy..]
voldemort NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say.
unknown man I will not disappoint you my lord.
voldemort Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.
voldemort Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
hermione Harry!
hermione Are you alright?
hermione Just now. You?
harry Last night].

ron Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
arthur Haven't the foggiest, keep up!
amos Arthur! It's about time son.
arthur Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?
cedric Yes sir.
amos Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.
harry Yes sir. This way.
amos Great great pleasure.
harry Pleasure to meet you too sir.
arthur That's it sir, just over there.
amos Shall we? We don't want to be late.
harry Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
fred That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
george It's a portkey.
amos Time to go. Ready?
harry What's a 'portkey'?

twins Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.
arthur Feet off the table.
twins Feet off the table.
harry I love magic.
ron Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?
lucius Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to know
draco Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of Cornelius Fudge himself.
lucius Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy yourself won't you. While you can.
arthur Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.
george Come on!
fred It's the Irish!
george Here come the Bulgarians!
weasleys Krum!!!
george Yes!
announcer Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin!
ron There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.
ginny Think you're in love Ron?
twins Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!
boys When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu!
fred Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.
arthur Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.
arthur Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility.
ron Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
harry What is THAT?
arthur Stop! That's my son.
arthur Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?
barty Which of you conjured this?
arthur You can't possibly..
barty Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!
harry Crime?
arthur Barty, they're just kids.
harry What crime?
hermione Harry it's his mark.
harry Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers.
barty Follow me.
harry There was a man. Before. There.
barty All of you, this way.
arthur Harry, who?
harry I dunno. I didn't see his face.
lady offscreen Anything from the trolley? Anything from the trolley?
lady Anything from the trolley dears?
ron Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
ron On second thought, just the drewbals.
harry It's alright I'll get it.
ron Just the drewbals, thanks.
cho Two pumpkin pasties please.
cho Thank you.
lady Anything sweet for you dear?
harry Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
hermione This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?
ron Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.
hermione It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
harry I'm fine.
hermione You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.
hagrid Clear the runway.
harry Well there's something you don't see every day.
dumbledore Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...
dumbledore So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime.
student Blimey, that's one big woman.
dumbledore And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.
ron Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!
igor Albus!
dumbledore Igor.
madame maxime Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They will need attending to.
dumbledore Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.
madame maxime But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt whiskey.
man You idiot!
dumbledore Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.
fred Wicked.
dumbledore For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
ron Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.
hermione Alastor Moody? The aura.
ron He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
dumbledore My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
mad-eye That stupid roof.
pupil What's that he's drinking do you suppose?
harry I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
barty After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.
george That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
dumbledore Silence!
dumbledore The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun.
mad-eye Alastor Moody.
mad-eye Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions?When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?
hermione Three sir.
mad-eye And they are so named?
hermione Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
mad-eye Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!
pupil Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head.
mad-eye So, which curse shall we see first?WEASLEY!
ron Yes...
mad-eye Give us a curse.
ron Well, my dad did tell me about one... The Imperius curse.
mad-eye Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.
mad-eye Hello. What a little beauty.
mad-eye Don't worry. Completely harmless.
mad-eye But if she bites... she's lethal!
mad-eye What are you laughing at?
mad-eye Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?
mad-eye Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the Imperius curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.
mad-eye Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.
neville There's the um... The Cruciatus curse.]
mad-eye Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.
hermione Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!
mad-eye Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger.
mad-eye The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room.
ron Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.
hermione There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.
hermione Neville?
mad-eye Son. You alright?
mad-eye Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.]
ron Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.
harry Yeah well rather you than me.
george Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it.
fred Cooked it up just this morning.
hermione It's not going to work.
fred Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
hermione You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
fred So?
hermione So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
george That's why it's so brilliant.
george Ready Fred?
fred Ready George?
george You said..
dumbledore Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!
dumbledore The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
dumbledore The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
dumbledore The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.
dumbledore Excellent! we now have our three champions!But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!
dumbledore Harry Potter. Harry Potter?
hagrid No... No.
dumbledore Harry Potter!
hermione Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
voice He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet.
dumbledore Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?]
harry No sir.
dumbledore Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?
harry No sir.
dumbledore You're absolutely sure?
harry Yes sir.
madame maxime Well of course he is lying.
mad-eye The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year.
igor You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.]
mad-eye It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?]
dumbledore That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.
barty The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion.
mcgonagall This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?
dumbledore What do you suggest Minerva?
mcgonagall Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.
dumbledore You heard Barty the rules are clear.
mcgonagall Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them...
severus Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold.
mcgonagall Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.
dumbledore I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?
mad-eye I can do that.
dumbledore Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are.
ron How did you do it?
ron Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
harry Let you know what?
ron You know bloody well what.
harry I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
ron Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.
harry I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok.
ron Piss off.
rita What a charismatic quartet. Hello!
rita I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely.
rita This is cosy.
harry It's a broomcupboard.
rita You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you?
harry Oh, no.
rita So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve..
harry I'm fourteen.
rita ...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?
harry I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
rita Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...
harry Fourteen.
rita The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.
harry No I didn't enter.
rita Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry. Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish.
harry Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.
sir Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....
harry AGH!
sir The bird bites.
harry Sirius?
rita Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his...
harry Sirius?! How...
sir I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?
harry No!
sir Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?
harry I dunno.
sir You didn't hear a name?
harry No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
sir What was that?
harry He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?
sir Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more.
harry What are you saying?
sir I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.
harry Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
sir I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.
harry I'm not ready for this Sirius.
sir You don't have a choice.
harry Someone's coming!
sir Keep your friends close Harry.
ron Who you talking to?
harry Who says I was talking to anyone.
ron I heard voices.
harry Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.
ron You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
neville Amazing. Amazing.
harry Neville! You're doing it again!
neville Oh, right sorry.
harry Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
neville Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.
hermione We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
hermione Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.
harry Is that right? Well.... what?
hermione Uhhh...
hermione Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
harry Well you can tell Ronald...
hermione I'm NOT an owl!
hagrid Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?
harry Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
hagrid You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.
harry What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
hagrid As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again.
madame maxime Hagrid?
hagrid Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.
hagrid Bonsoir Olympe.
madame maxime Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten me.
hagrid Couldn't forget you Olympe.
madame maxime What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.
hagrid You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
madame maxime Ahh, c'est magnifique!
madame maxime Can we get closer?
harry Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
hagrid Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.
hagrid Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know.
harry Ron was here?
hagrid Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?
harry No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
boy Cedric rules!
harry Thanks.
boy Like the badge?
harry Excuse me..
harry Can I have a word?
cedric Alright.
harry Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.
cedric Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?
harry Yes.
cedric Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them.
harry Don't worry about it.
harry You're a right foul git you know that?
ron You think so?
harry I know so.
ron Anything else?
harry Yeah. Stay away from me.
ron Fine.
draco Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last FIVE.
harry I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.
mad-eye I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned.
mcgonagall Professor Moody what are you doing?
mad-eye Teaching.
mcgonagall Is that a student?
mad-eye Technically it's a ferret.
draco My father will hear about this!
mad-eye Is that a threat!
mad-eye I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!
mcgonagall We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that.
mad-eye He might've mentioned it.
mcgonagall Well you will do well to remember it.
mad-eye come with me.
mad-eye That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.
mad-eye Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?
harry Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
mad-eye Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths?
harry Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
mad-eye Better than fair the way I heard it.
harry But I'm not allowed a broom.
mad-eye You're allowed a wand.
hermione Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
harry Yeah.
hermione How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
harry Battle a dragon.
rita Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today you might make the front page.
viktor You have no business here. This tent is for champions and friends.
rita No matter. We've got what we wanted.
dumbledore Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate.
dumbledore What are you doing here Miss Granger?
hermione Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
dumbledore Barty. The bag.
barty Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...
barty The welsh green. Mr Krum...
barty The chinese fireball. Oooooh.
barty The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...
harry The horntail...
barty What's that boy?
harry Nothing.
barty The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?
dumbledore Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...
dumbledore Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.
hermione Your wand harry! Your wand!
george We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
fred Lose a leg.
george Or an arm.
fred Pack it in altogether.
twins NEVER!
seamus Go on Harry, what's the clue?
harry Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
harry What the bloody hell was that?
fred Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.
ron I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
harry Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
ron Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
harry Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
ron At least I warned you about the dragons.
harry Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
ron Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember?I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.
harry Who could possibly figure that out?That's completely mental.
ron Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
hermione Boys.
hermione Look at this!I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
nigel Parcel for you Mr Weasley.
ron Thank you Nigel.
ron Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
ron I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
harry Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?
ron Ginny these must be for you.
ginny I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
ron What are you on about?
hermione They're not for Ginny they're for you!Dress robes.
ron Dress robes? for what?
mcgonagall The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.
mcgonagall Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.
fred Try saying that five times faster.
mcgonagall Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight.
ron Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.
mcgonagall Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join me.
mcgonagall Now, place your right hand on my waist.
ron Where?
mcgonagall My waist.
mcgonagall Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...
mcgonagall One two three, one two three, one two three.
harry Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
twins Never.
mcgonagall Everybody come together.
mcgonagall Boys, on your feet.
harry Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
ron Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?
harry I think I'd take the dragon right now.
hagrid I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser.
hagrid And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!
ron This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
ron Well, us and Neville!
harry But then again he can take himself.
hermione It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
ron Now I'm really depressed.
ron Well Hermione, you're a girl.
hermione Oh well spotted.
ron Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
hermione I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
ron Bloody hell.
ron Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
harry Agreed.
cho Harry!
harry Cho!
cho Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top.
harry Ok thanks. Cho?
cho Yes?
harry Um. I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
cho Sorry? I didn't catch that.
harry Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
cho Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've said I'll go with him.
harry Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
cho Harry I really am sorry.
harry What happened to you?
girl He just asked Fleur Delacour out.
hermione What?
harry What did she say?
hermione No of course.
hermione She said yes??
harry Don't be silly.
ron There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.
girl Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening.
harry What did you do then?
ron What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
patils Hi Harry.
harry Hey!
ron Bloody hell.
ron What are those??
harry My dress robes.
ron Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.
harry Well I expect yours are more traditional.
ron Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
ron I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
harry Leave it alone.
ron Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.
harry Who?
ron Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
harry Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
ron Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
parvati Hello boys. Don't you look...
parvati ... dashing.
mcgonagall Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?
harry Ready professor?
mcgonagall To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.
harry No.
mcgonagall Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil.
parvati She looks beautiful.
harry Yeah she does.
padma Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum??
ron No. Absolutely not.
parvati Harry. Take my waist.
harry What?
parvati Now.
hermione Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
ron No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.
hermione What's got your wand in a knot?
ron He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
hermione The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph?Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.
ron Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
padma Are you going to ask me to dance or not?
ron No.
ron He's using you.
hermione How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
ron Doubt it. He's way too old.
hermione What? What? That's what you think?
ron Yeah that is what I think.
hermione You know the solution then don't you.
ron Go on.
hermione Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.
ron Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
hermione Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
ron They get scary when they get older.
hermione Ron you spoil everything!
voldermort Let me see it again.
voldemort Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry!At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting!
neville You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
hermione Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
harry Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
hermione I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?
harry What's that supposed to mean?
hermione I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
cedric Hey Potter.
harry Cedric.
cedric How are you?
harry Spectacular.
cedric Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
harry Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
cedric Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
cedric It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.
harry I must be out of my mind.
myrtle I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
harry Myrtle!
myrtle Long time no see.
myrtle I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry?
harry Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?
myrtle Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one. Cedric.
myrtle Well go on, open it.
voice SINGING Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took.
harry Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?
myrtle Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles were gone...
hermione Harry, tell me again.
harry Come seek us where our voices sound.
hermione The black lake, that's obvious.
harry An hour long you'll have to look.
hermione Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic
harry Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
hermione Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
mad-eye Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger.
hermione But sir, the second task is only hours away and...
mad-eye Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
mad-eye Why don't you help Potter put his books back.
neville You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?
harry Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.
neville I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.
harry You're sure about this Neville.
neville Absolutely.
harry For an hour.
neville Most likely.
harry Most likely?
neville Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.
harry You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
neville I just wanted to help.
harry Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
neville You seem a little tense Harry.
harry Do I?
dumbledore Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own.
mad-eye Put that in your mouth.
dumbledore You may begin at the start of the cannon.
seamus What's the matter with him?
friend I don't know I can't see him.
neville Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!
dumbledore The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.
harry But she's my friend too!
merperson Only one.
dumbledore Harry!
barty Get him another towel.
dumbledore I want all the judges over here now.
fleur You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My little sister!
fleur Thank you! And you... . You helped!
ron Well... yeah... a bit
ron Merci.
hermione Harry!
harry Hermione
hermione Are you alright? You must be freezing!Personally I think you behaved admirably.
harry I finished last Hermione.
hermione Next to last.
dumbledore Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
dumbledore For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place!For outstanding moral fibre.
fred All that moral fibre eh?
ron Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
george Well done 'moral fibre'.
barty Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter.
mad-eye Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!
mad-eye And they say I'm mad.
hagrid So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later.
ron We're still misfits.
hagrid Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!
harry Mr Crouch?]
dumbledore A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action.
fudge I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength Dumbledore.
dumbledore Then for once show them some.
fudge The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.
dumbledore But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.
fudge What did you say? What did you say to me?
mad-eye Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private.
fudge Harry! Harry how good to see you again.
harry I can come back later Professor.
dumbledore Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.
harry Agh!
harry Professor?
man Professor.
barty Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?
igor I do sir.
barty What do you wish to present?
igor I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.
barty Mr Rosier is dead.
igor Dead?
mad-eye Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.
igor I didn't know.
barty If that is all the witness has to offer...
igor No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.
barty Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.
igor Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself.
barty Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.
igor NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape.
dumbledore The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am.
igor It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.
barty Silence!
barty Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.
igor Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.
barty What's that?
igor The name...
barty Yes?
igor I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and...
barty The name! Give me the wretched name!
igor Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
barty JR Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father.
barty You are no son of mine.
barty JR GAHHHH!
dumbledore Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.
harry Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?
dumbledore He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?
harry It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son.
dumbledore Have there been other dreams like this?
harry Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?
dumbledore I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply...
dumbledore Cast them away.
igor It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I.
severus Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?
harry Yes sir.
severus Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is?
harry Bubble juice sir?
severus Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
harry I haven't stolen anything.
severus Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm going to find out why.
dumbledore Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...
dumbledore and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...
dumbledore The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round.
dumbledore In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.
mad-eye Champions! Prepare yourselves.
dumbledore On the count of three... ONE...
harry Fleur? Fleur!
cedric Get down!
harry No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
cedric Get off me!
harry He's bewitched!
cedric Harry! Harry!
cedric You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.
harry For a moment so did I.
cedric Some game huh?
harry Some game.
cedric Go. Take it, you saved me!
harry Together, on three. One, two, three!
cedric You ok?
harry Yeah, you?
cedric Where are we?
harry I've been here before.
cedric It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.
harry I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!
cedric What are you talking about?
cedric What is it?
harry Get back to the cup!
cedric Who are you? What do you want?
voldemort Kill the spare.
harry Cedric!
voldemort Do it, now!
wormtail Bones of the father, unwillingly given.
wormtail Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.
wormtail Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.
wormtail The dark lord shall rise again.
voldemort My wand Wormtail.
voldemort Hold out your arm.
wormtail Master. Thank you master.
voldemort The other arm Wormtail.
voldemort Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.
voldemort Not even you, Lucius.
lucius My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your whereabouts.
voldemort There were signs my friend, and more than whispers.
lucius I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask.
wormtail I returned.
voldemort Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.
wormtail Thank you master, thank you.
voldemort Oh, such a handsome boy.
harry Don't touch him.
voldemort Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago?Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now!
voldemort Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!
voldemort That's better. And now...
voldemort Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up.
voldemort Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.
harry Have it your way.
voldemort Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!
harry'S DAD Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand?
cedric Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father.
harry'S MOTHER Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!
voldemort No!
dumbledore Harry! Harry!
dumbledore Tell me what happened!
harry He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there.
dumbledore It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.
fudge Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people.
amos Let me through! That's my son! My boy!
mad-eye Are you alright Potter?
mad-eye Does it hurt?
harry Not so much now.
mad-eye I'd better take a look at it.
harry The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
mad-eye What was it like? What was he like?
harry Who?
mad-eye The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?
harry I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
mad-eye Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?
harry Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
mad-eye Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh??
harry It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...
mad-eye You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.
dumbledore Severus...
dumbledore Do you know who I am?
mad-eye Albus Dumbledore.
dumbledore Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?
mad-eye No.
dumbledore Is he in this room? Is he in this room?
dumbledore Harry get away from there!
dumbledore Are you alright Alastor?
alastor I'm sorry Albus.
harry That's Moody, but then who's...?
severus Polyjuice potion.
dumbledore Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.
dumbledore We'll get you up in a minute.
dumbledore Barty Crouch Junior.
barty JR I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
dumbledore Your arm Harry.
barty JR You know what this means don't you?He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.
dumbledore Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
barty JR I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
dumbledore Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.
dumbledore Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see,
dumbledore I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.
harry Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
dumbledore Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared.
dumbledore No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone.
viktor Write to me. Promise.
hermione Bye.
fleur Au revoir Ron.
ron Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
hermione No.
harry No I don't think so.
hermione Everything's going to change now isn't it?
harry Yes.
hermione Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
ron Well I won't. You know I won't!
hermione Harry will won't you?
harry Yeah. Every week.
