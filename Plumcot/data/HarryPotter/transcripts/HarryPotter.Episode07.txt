not_available These are dark time there is no denying.
not_available Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.
not_available But I say this to our citizens.
not_available We, ever your servants ... Will continue to defend you liberty and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.
not_available Your ministry remains strong.

not_available Hermione, tea is ready, Darling
not_available I'm coming, Mom!
not_available C'Mon Dudley hurry up
not_available I still don't understand
not_available why we have to leave?.
not_available Because its
not_available not safe around here anymore
not_available Ron?
not_available evening is finished.
not_available Obliviate.
not_available HARRY POTTER AND
not_available THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
not_available Severus, I was beginning to worry
not_available you'd lost your way...
not_available ...Come, we have saved you a seat
not_available You bring news, I trust
not_available It will happen next Saturday.
not_available At nightfall
not_available I've heard differently
not_available my lord.
not_available Dawlish, the auror has let slip
not_available that the Potter boy will not be moved
not_available until the 30th of this month.
not_available The day before he turns 17
not_available This is a false trail
not_available The auror office no longer plays any part
not_available in the protection of Harry Potter.
not_available Those closest to him think
not_available that we have infiltrated the Ministry.
not_available Well, they got that right., didn't they ?
not_available What say you , Pius?
not_available One hears many things
not_available my lord.
not_available But whether the truth is
not_available among them, is not clear.
not_available Spoken like a true politican.
not_available you will I think
not_available prove most useful, Pius.
not_available Where will he be taken the boy?
not_available To a safe house.
not_available Most likely the home
not_available of someone in the Order.
not_available I'm told its been given protection
not_available of every manner possible
not_available Once there it will be
not_available impractical to attack him
not_available My lord, I'd like to
not_available volunteer myself for this task.
not_available I want to kill the boy
not_available Wormtail
not_available Have i not spoken to you
not_available about keeping our guest quiet ?
not_available Yes, my lord.
not_available Right away, my lord.
not_available As inspiring as I find
not_available your bloodlust, Bellatrix ...
not_available ... I must be the one
not_available to kill Harry Potter.
not_available But I face an
not_available unfortunate complication.
not_available My wand and the Potters
not_available share the same core.
not_available They are, someways, twins.
not_available We can wound but not
not_available fatally harm one another.
not_available If I am to kill him ...
not_available ... must do it with
not_available anothers wand
not_available Well, surely one of you
not_available would like the honor
not_available What about you, Lucius?
not_available My lord?
not_available "My Lord"?
not_available I require your wand.
not_available Do I detect elm?
not_available Yes, my Lord.
not_available And the core?
not_available Dragon heartstring my lord
not_available Dragon heartstringt?
not_available To those of you who do not know ...
not_available ...we are joined here tonight
not_available by Miss Charity Burbage ...
not_available ... who until recently taught
not_available at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry
not_available Her speciality was muggle studies
not_available It is Miss Burbage's belief that
not_available Muggles are not so different. than us
not_available She would given her way ...
not_available ... have us mate with them.
not_available To her the mixture of magical and
not_available Muggle blood is not an abomination ...
not_available ... but something,
not_available to be encouraged.
not_available Severus.
not_available Severus, please.
not_available We're friends.
not_available Nagini.
not_available Dinner.
not_available Hello Harry!
not_available Hi!
not_available Hi!
not_available You're looking fit.
not_available Yeah, he is absolutely gorgeous...
not_available Lets say we get undercover,
not_available before someone blows you..
not_available Do you?
not_available Kingsley, weren't you looking
not_available after the PrimeMinister?
not_available You are more important.
not_available Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.
not_available Pleasure to meet you.
not_available He wasn't always so handsome
not_available Daredevil.
not_available True enough
not_available Happened while fighting a werewolf called Greyback
not_available I Would like to return the favour one day
not_available You're still beautiful to me, Billy.
not_available Just remember, Fleur
not_available Bill takes his steak on the raw side now
not_available My husband the joker.
not_available By the way,
not_available Wait till you hear the news...
not_available Can't wait no time for cozy catch up.
not_available We have to get the hell out of here.
not_available Potter, you are underage, which means
not_available you've still got the trace on you.
not_available What is the trace?
not_available If you sneezed, the Ministry
not_available will know who wiped your nose.
not_available The point is that we have to use those modes,
not_available of transport which the trace can't detect
not_available Brooms, thestrals and like
not_available We'll go in pairs.
not_available That way if anything is out there waiting
not_available for us...I reckon there will be
not_available ... they won't know which
not_available Harry Potter is the real one.
not_available The real one ?
not_available I do believe you are fully
not_available aware of this particular brew
not_available No, absolutely not.
not_available I told you he won't take it well.
not_available No, if you think that I'll let,
not_available everyone risk their lives for me ...
not_available Have done if before, haven't we.
not_available No, no, this is different.
not_available Taking that becoming me.
not_available No!
not_available Well none of us really
not_available fancy it mate
not_available Yes, imagine if something went wrong,
not_available and we be stuck as scrawny specky gits forever
not_available Everyone here is of age, Potter.
not_available They all agreed to take the risk.
not_available Technically I'd been coerced
not_available Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Aways been a huge admirer.
not_available Nip it, Mundungus.
not_available Alright Granger its discussed
not_available Blimey, Hermione!
not_available Put it in there, please.

not_available polyjuice potion before, fair warning.

not_available Just trying to defuse the
not_available tension.
not_available Wow! we are identical!
not_available Not yet you are not.
not_available Haven't you got something a bit more sporting?
not_available Yeah I don't really fancy this color.
not_available Well fancy this , you are not you
not_available so shove it up and strip
not_available Alright, Alright
not_available You too, Potter.
not_available Bill, look away, I'm hideous.
not_available Ginny did lie about that tattoo.
not_available Harry, your eyesight really is aweful.
not_available Well,we will be pairing off.
not_available Everyone will have a protector.
not_available Mundungus, stick tight to me.
not_available I want to keep an eye on you
not_available As for Harry ...
not_available Yes?
not_available The real Harry.
not_available Where the devil are you anyway?
not_available Here.
not_available You ride with Hagrid.
not_available I brough you here 16 years ago,
not_available when you were no bigger than a bowtruckle.
not_available Seems only right that
not_available I should be the one that takes you away.
not_available Yes this is all very touching.
not_available Lets go !
not_available Head for the Burrow.
not_available We rendezvous you there.
not_available On the count of three!
not_available Hold tight, Harry!
not_available One!
not_available Two!

not_available Hagrid, we have to help the others!
not_available We can't do that, Harry

not_available Are you mad?
not_available What creature?
not_available A Grindylow.
not_available We have been betrayed .
not_available Voldemort knew
not_available you were being moved tonight.
not_available I had to make sure,
not_available you were not an imposter.
not_available Wait!
not_available The last words Albus Dumbledore,
not_available spoke to the pair of us.
not_available "Harry is the best hope we have."
not_available "Trust him."
not_available What gave you away?
not_available Hedwig i think.
not_available She was trying to protect me.
not_available Thanks.
not_available He deserves that. Brilliant he was.
not_available I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him.
not_available Really?
not_available Why is it always so suprising?
not_available We are the last back?.
not_available Where's George?
not_available How are you feeling, Georgie?
not_available Saintlike.
not_available Come again?
not_available Saintlike.
not_available Im holey. I'm holey fred

not_available A whole wide world of ear related
not_available humour and you go for holey.
not_available Pathetic.
not_available I'm still better looking than you.
not_available Mad
not_available Eye is dead.
not_available Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
not_available and disapparated.
not_available head for the burrow
not_available Seven. Seven.
not_available This is more than I ever imagined.
not_available Horcruxes ...
not_available They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they.
not_available to tear the soul

not_available If we destroy each Horcruxes ...
not_available One destroys Voldemort.

not_available Going somewhere?
not_available Nobody else is going to die.
not_available Not for me.
not_available Because of you?
not_available You think Mad
not_available Eye died
not_available for you?
not_available Think George
not_available took that curse for you?
not_available You maybe the chosen one, mate ...
not_available ... but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
not_available Its always been bigger than that.
not_available Come with me.
not_available And leave Hermione?
not_available Are you mad.
not_available We won't last two days.
not_available without her
not_available Do not tell her
not_available I said that.

not_available you still got the wedding ...
not_available ... the wedding ...
not_available I don't care about a wedding.
not_available I'm Sorry, no matter whose it is.
not_available I have to start finding these Horcruxes?.
not_available They are our only chance,
not_available to beat him.
not_available And the longer we stay here,
not_available the stronger he gets.
not_available Try and understand me
not_available You will only be doing him a favor.
not_available Do you think he knows?
not_available I mean they are bits of his soul,
not_available the Horcruxes.
not_available Pieces of him.
not_available When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring ...
not_available ... and you destroyed
not_available Tom Riddle's Diary.
not_available He must have felt something?.
not_available To kill thei other Horcruxes,
not_available we have to find them?.

not_available Herein is is said forth
not_available ...?
not_available the last will and testament of ...
not_available ... Albus Percival Wulfric
not_available Brian Dumbledore.
not_available First, to
not_available Ronald Billius Weasley ... "
not_available "... I leave my delumin�tor."
not_available "A device, of my own making ..."
not_available "... In hope when things
not_available seem most dark ... "
not_available "... it will show you the light."
not_available Dumbledore left this for me?
not_available Yes.
not_available Really.
not_available What is it?
not_available Super.
not_available " To Hermione Jean Granger ..."
not_available "... I leave my copy of
not_available Tales of Beedle the Bard ..."
not_available "... In the hope that she finds it
not_available entertaining and instructive "
not_available Mom used to tell me those.
not_available The wizard and the hopping pot,
not_available Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump ...
not_available Come on.
not_available Babbity Rabbity...
not_available No?
not_available "To Harry James Potter ..."
not_available "... I leave the snitch he caught
not_available in his first match at Hogwarts... "
not_available "... As a reminder of
not_available rewards of perseverance ... "
not_available "... And skill."
not_available Is that it then?
not_available Not quite.
not_available Dumbledore left you ...
not_available ... a second bequest
not_available The sword of
not_available Godric Gryffindor.
not_available Unfortunately the sword of Gryffindor
not_available was not Dumbledore's to give away.
not_available As an important
not_available historical artifact it belongs ...
not_available to Harry.
not_available It belongs to Harry.
not_available It came to him when he most
not_available needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
not_available The sword may present itself to
not_available any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger ...
not_available ... but that does not make it
not_available that wizards property
not_available Unfortunately the current
not_available whereabout of the sword are unknown.
not_available Excuse me?
not_available The Sword is Missing.
not_available I don't know what you are up,
not_available to, Mr. Potter ...
not_available ... but you can't fight
not_available this war on your own
not_available He is too strong.
not_available Hello, Harry.
not_available i've interrupted
not_available deep thoughts, haven't I?
not_available I see a growing
not_available in your eyes
not_available Of course not.
not_available How are you, Luna?
not_available Very well, The garden
not_available gnome has bitten my finger...

not_available ... during his lifetime and after his death,
not_available and we also support you.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Come Daddy.
not_available Harry does not want to talk to us right now?.
not_available He is just too polite
not_available to point it out.
not_available Harry Potter ...
not_available Excuse me, sir.
not_available May I sit down?
not_available Mr. Potter.
not_available By all means...here
not_available I found what you wrote
not_available in the Daily Prophet.
not_available really moving.
not_available You obviously knew
not_available Dumbledore well.
not_available Well, I certainly
not_available knew him the longest.
not_available Unless we count his brother Aberforth,
not_available and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth.
not_available I didn't even know
not_available he had a brother.
not_available Ah Well, Dumbledore was always
not_available very private, even as a boy.
not_available Do not despair, Elphias.
not_available I'm told he has been thoroughly
not_available unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.
not_available in 800 pages.
not_available Word has it
not_available that someone talked to her.
not_available Someone who knew the
not_available Dumbledore family well.
not_available Both you and I know
not_available who that is , Elphias.
not_available Monstrous betrayal.
not_available Who are we talking about?
not_available Bathilda Bagshot.
not_available Who?
not_available Oh, boy ...
not_available ... she's only the most celebrated
not_available magical historian of the last century.
not_available She was as close to Dumbledore
not_available as anyone
not_available Sure Rita Skeeter thought it well
not_available worth a trip to Godric's Hollow ...
not_available ... to take a peek into
not_available that old birds records.
not_available Godris Hollow?
not_available Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
not_available Thats where she first met Dumbledore.
not_available You don't say thar he lived there too.
not_available His family moved
not_available there ...
not_available ... after his father killed
not_available those three Muggles.
not_available It was a quite the scandal.
not_available Honestly my boy ...
not_available ... are you sure
not_available that you knew him at all?
not_available Ministry has fallen.
not_available Minister of Magic is dead.

not_available Yes It was here, in this house.
not_available Most evil object.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available Before Master. Regulus died ...
not_available ... he ordered Kreacher to destroy the locket,
not_available but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
not_available he could not do it.
not_available Well, where is it now?
not_available Did someone take it?
not_available He came in the night.
not_available He took many things
not_available including the locket.
not_available Who?
not_available Who was it, Kreacher?
not_available Mundungus.
not_available Mundungus Fletcher.
not_available Find him.
not_available My father will hear about this.

not_available You found a locket am I right?
not_available Boy, was it valuable?
not_available Bleeding gave it away, didn't I ?
not_available There I was selling my goods ...
not_available ... when some Ministry hag comes up
not_available and asks to see my license.
not_available she says
not_available she would lock me up?.
not_available Would have done too if she
not_available didn't take a fancy to that locket.
not_available Who was it?

not_available As if his life depended on it
not_available .
not_available Don't, its his comfort zone.
not_available ?
not_available It sets my teeth on edge,,
not_available Whats he expecting to hear? Good news?

not_available I'll tell you in a minute.
not_available You can tell me now?
not_available Sword of Gryffindor .
not_available Its goblin made
not_available Brilliant.
not_available No, you don't understand.
not_available Dirt and dust
not_available have no effect on the blade.
not_available It only takes in that
not_available which makes it stronger.
not_available Okay ...
not_available we are looking for a way to destroy horcrux , right ?
not_available Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
not_available With a basilisk.fang
not_available If you tell me you got ,
not_available one of those in that bloody beeded bag of yours ...
not_available Don't you see? In The Chamber of Secrets
not_available you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor
not_available Its blade is impregnated with
not_available basilisk venom.
not_available It only takes in that
not_available which makes it stronger
not_available Exactly, which is why
not_available It can destroy Horcruxes.
not_available Thats why Dumbledore
not_available left it to you in his will.
not_available You're brilliant, Hermione.
not_available Truely.
not_available Actually, I just highly logical thinking,
not_available which allows to me see past and irrelevant details ...
not_available ... and perceived cleary which
not_available others overlook
not_available Yeah, there is only one problem.
not_available Someone stole the sword.
not_available Hey, I'm still here.
not_available You two carry on.
not_available Don't let me spoil the fun.
not_available I told you everything
not_available that Dumbledore told me!
not_available Incase you haven't noticed
not_available We have found one Horcrux already.
not_available Yes, and we are as close to getting rid
not_available of it as we are to finding the rest, aren't we?
not_available Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux ...
not_available you wouldn't have spoken like this
not_available if you hadn't wore it all day
not_available You know, why I listen to the radio every night?
not_available To make sure that i don't hear Ginny's name,
not_available or Fred, or George or moms ...
not_available You think i don't know that ?
not_available You think i don't know how it feels?
not_available You don't know how it feels!
not_available Your parents are dead!
not_available You have no family!

not_available Ron!
not_available Ron, where are you going?
not_available Come back, now!
not_available Salvia Hexi
not_available I opens at the close
not_available Hermione?
not_available Hermione?
not_available You were right.
not_available Snithced have flesh memory ...
not_available ... but I did not catch the first snitch with my hand.
not_available I almost swallowed it.
not_available "I open at the close."
not_available What do you think that means?
not_available I don't know.
not_available I found something as well
not_available At first I thought it was an eye
not_available it's eye, but now I don't think it is.
not_available And it's no rune,
not_available it is anywhere in Spellmans syllabury.
not_available Someone wrote it there.
not_available Somebody inked it in
not_available it isn't part of the book
not_available Luna's dad was wearing that at
not_available the wedding of Bill and Fleur.
not_available Why would someone draw
not_available it in a childrens book?
not_available Hermione, I've been thinking
not_available I want to go to Godric's Hollow
not_available Its where I was born ,
not_available Its where my parents died.
not_available Thats exactly why they'll expect you to go
not_available it means something to you
not_available But it means something to
not_available him too, Hermione.
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who almost died there.
not_available Isn't that exactly the type of place
not_available he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?
not_available It is dangerous, Harry.
not_available But I admit it recently I've been thinking
not_available we have to go there
not_available I think its is possible that
not_available something else is hidden there.
not_available What?
not_available The Sword.
not_available If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
not_available and to not let it fall into the hands of the Ministry ...
not_available ... what better place to hide it
not_available than the birthplace of founder of Gryffindor
not_available Hermione ...
not_available Don't tell me I have to give
not_available you a haircut again
not_available I still think that we
not_available should use Polyjuice Potion.
not_available No.
not_available This is where I was born.
not_available I don't want to return?,
not_available as someone else.
not_available Harry, I think it is Christmas eve.
not_available Listen.
not_available Do you think they are here, Hermione?
not_available My mom and dad.
not_available I think so.
not_available Ignotus Peverell.
not_available Hey, Harry?
not_available Merry Christmas, Hermione.
not_available Merry Christmas, Harry.
not_available Harry, someone is watching us.
not_available Near the church.
not_available I think I know who it is.
not_available I don't know this, Harry.
not_available Hermione, Dumbledore knew.
not_available She might have the sword.
not_available This is where they died, Hermione.
not_available This is where he murdered them.
not_available Bathilda, aren't you ?
not_available Leave it, let me do that.
not_available Miss Bagshot,
not_available Who is this man?
not_available Harry!
not_available Are you feeling better?
not_available This time can be overcome,
not_available Hermione.
not_available Forest of Dean.
not_available I came here once with my mother and father.
not_available Years ago.
not_available Its just
not_available how I remember it.
not_available Trees, the river, everything.
not_available Like nothings changed.
not_available This of course is true,
not_available everything has changed.
not_available If there were my parents,
not_available they would have nothing nepam�tali.
not_available Or trees.
not_available Or river.
not_available Not even me.
not_available Perhaps we should
not_available stay here, Harry.
not_available Grow old?.
not_available You wanted to know
not_available Who was the boy in the photograph was.
not_available I know.
not_available Gellert Grindelwald.
not_available He's the thief I saw
not_available in Gregorovitch's wandshop.
not_available Speaking of which
not_available where's my wand?
not_available Where's my wand, Hermione?
not_available As we were leaving Godrics Hollow I cast a curse.
not_available and it rebounded
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I tried to mend it,
not_available But wands are different.
not_available Its nothing.

not_available Yes.
not_available Didn't hurt yourself did you ?
not_available You cast the doe as well did you?
not_available No, I thought that was you.
not_available No, my Patronus is a stag.
not_available Clear.
not_available Okay, Ron.
not_available Do it.
not_available I can not. The thing affect me more
not_available as you and Hermione.
not_available All the more reason
not_available I can not.

not_available Why did you come back?
not_available I'll have to speak to it to open it
not_available When it does, don't hesitate.
not_available I don't know whats in there, but it will put up a fight?.
not_available The bit of Riddle in the diary was trying to kill me?.
not_available One.

not_available Three.
not_available and I see your heart and it is mine.

not_available What are you compared to the chosen one?
not_available Ron, its lying!
not_available Your mother confessed,
not_available she would prefer as a son.
not_available What woman would take you?
not_available you are .
not_available Nothing...Nothing
not_available Nothing compared to him.
not_available Just think
not_available There are only three to go.
not_available Hermione?
not_available Hermione?
not_available Is everything alright?
not_available Fine...

not_available Harry Potter
not_available You give me my wand!
not_available What happened to your wand?
not_available Nevermind he's got my wand.
not_available What is that?
not_available You destroyed it.
not_available And how is it that you just happened to have the
not_available sword of Gryffindor ?
not_available It's a long story.
not_available Don't think
not_available it changes anything.
not_available Of course not. I only destroyed a
not_available bloody Horcrux, why will that change anything.
not_available I wanted to come back
not_available as soon as I left.
not_available just didn't know how to find you
not_available how did you found us ?
not_available With this. Doesn't just
not_available Turn out lights
not_available I don't know how it works
not_available but christmas morning I sleping in this little pub ...
not_available ... keeping away from some snatchers.
not_available When I heard it.
not_available What?
not_available Voice.
not_available Your voice, Hermione.
not_available comin out of it.
not_available And what exactly did I say
not_available if I may ask?
not_available My name.
not_available Just my name.
not_available like a Whisper
not_available So I took it, clicked it ...
not_available ... this tiny ball of light appeared
not_available And I knew.
not_available sure enough.
not_available Flew towards me,
not_available ball of light.
not_available Right into my chest.
not_available Straight through me.
not_available Right here
not_available I knew that it was gonna take me
not_available where I needed to go
not_available so I disapparated
not_available came to this hillside
not_available It was dark, I had
not_available no idea where I was.
not_available I just hoped
not_available One of you will show yourself
not_available you did
not_available I have always liked these flames
not_available Hermione makes.
not_available How long do you think
not_available she will stay mad at me?
not_available i don't know ...
not_available just keep talking about that little ball,
not_available and it might touch her in the heart ...
not_available ... and she will come around.
not_available It's true. Every word.
not_available This is gonna sound crazy.
not_available But I think,thats why Dubledore left it to me
not_available The delumin�tor.

not_available I'll need to find my way back

not_available Sorry?
not_available See this ? It is a letter
not_available Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.
not_available Look at the signature.
not_available It's the mark again
not_available It keeps cropping up.
not_available in The tales of Beedle the Bard,
not_available in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow ...
not_available it was there too.
not_available Where?
not_available Outside Gregorvitch's wandshop.
not_available What dors it mean?
not_available Look...
not_available You have no idea where the next Horcrux is
not_available , and neither I do
not_available But this,
not_available this means something.
not_available I am sure of it.
not_available Yeah. Hermione's right.
not_available We ought to see Lovegood
not_available Lets vote.
not_available Those in favor.
not_available are you still mad at him?
not_available I am always mad at him
not_available KEEP OFF THE
not_available DIRIGIBLE PLUMS
not_available Do not touch
not_available Dirigible Plums.
not_available What is it?
not_available Who are you?
not_available What do you want?
not_available Hello, Mr. Lovegood.
not_available I'm Harry Potter,
not_available we met a few months ago.
not_available Can we come in?
not_available Where is Luna?
not_available I don't know.
not_available She will be along.
not_available So...how can I
not_available help you, Mr Potter ?
not_available Well, actually ...
not_available ... it was about something that you were wearing
not_available around your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
not_available You mean this?
not_available Yes.
not_available That's it exactly
not_available What I wonder is ...
not_available what is it?
not_available What is it?
not_available Well.. its the sign of
not_available the deathly hallows ofcourse .
not_available The What?
not_available The What?
not_available The Deathly Hallows. I assume you are all
not_available familiar with the tale of the three brothers?
not_available Yes.
not_available No.
not_available I have it in here.
not_available There were once three brothers,
not_available who were travelling along a lonely
not_available winding road ...
not_available ... at twilight
not_available Midnight.
not_available Mom always said midnight.
not_available Twilight is fine.
not_available better actually.
not_available There were once three brothers,
not_available who were travelling along a lonely
not_available winding road ...
not_available ... at twilight.
not_available In time the brothers reached a
not_available river too treacherous to pass
not_available But they were learned in the magical arts
not_available the three brothers simply waved their wands..
not_available ... and made a bridge.
not_available Before they could cross however they
not_available found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
not_available It was Death
not_available And he felt cheated
not_available Cheated, because travelers
not_available usually drowned in the river.
not_available But Death was cunning.
not_available he pretended to congratulate
not_available the three brothers .on their magic..
not_available ... and said,
not_available that each had earned a prize ...
not_available ... for being clever enough
not_available to evade him
not_available the oldest asked for a wand,
not_available more powerful than any in existence
not_available so death fashioned him a wand
not_available from the elder tree that stood nearby
not_available The second brother he decided
not_available he wanted to humiliate death
not_available even further..
not_available ... and asked for the power
not_available to recall loved ones from
not_available their graves
not_available So Death picked a stone from the river
not_available and offered it to him.
not_available Finally, Death turned to
not_available the third brother.
not_available A humble man, asked for something
not_available that allowed him to go from that place...
not_available ...without being followed
not_available by death
not_available And so it was that death reluctantly
not_available handed over his own cloak of
not_available invisibility
not_available The first brother travelled
not_available to a distant village...
not_available ... with the elder wand in his hand
not_available he killed a wizard with whom he once had quarrels..
not_available Drunk with the power that
not_available the elder wand had given him..
not_available ... he bragged about it
not_available You shall not prevail against his nose? ou.
not_available But that night ...
not_available ...another wizard stole the wand
not_available and slit the brothers throat for good measure.
not_available And so the death took the first brother.
not_available for his own
not_available The second brother journeyed home,
not_available where he took the stone and
not_available turned it thrice in his hand
not_available To his delight the girl he once
not_available wanted to marry before her untimely death...
not_available ... appeared before him.
not_available But soon she turned sad and cold
not_available because she did not belong to the mortal world
not_available Driven mad with hopeless longing
not_available the second brother killed himself
not_available so as to join her
not_available And so death took the second brother
not_available As for the third brother Death
not_available searched for many years
not_available but was never able to find him
not_available only when he had attained a great age the
not_available youngest brother shed the cloak of invisibilty
not_available and gave it to his son ...
not_available .. he then greeted death
not_available as a old friend
not_available and went with him gladly
not_available departing this life as equals
not_available so there we are
not_available Those are the Deathly Hallows.
not_available I'm sorry sir,
not_available I still don't quite understand.
not_available The Elder wand ...
not_available ... the most powerful wand
not_available ever made.
not_available The resurrection stone
not_available The cloak of invisibility
not_available Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
not_available Together they make one
not_available master of death.
not_available That mark was on the grave in
not_available Godrics Hollow.
not_available Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell
not_available family have something to do with
not_available the deathly hallows
not_available Yes, Ignotus, and his brothers
not_available Cadmus and Antioch were the original owner of the hallows ...
not_available ... and therefore inspiration for the story.
not_available Your tea has gone cold
not_available Don't go
not_available I'll be right back?.
not_available Let's get out of here .
not_available I have more of this �brndy pi? I will not.
not_available Thank you for ...
not_available You forgot the water.
not_available Water ?
not_available In the tea.
not_available How silly of me.
not_available You do not have to,
not_available we should be going any way.
not_available No, you do not!
not_available Sir?
not_available You are my only hope.
not_available They were angry, you see,
not_available because of what I've been writing.
not_available so they took ...
not_available ... took my children.
not_available my children
not_available ?
not_available Who took her, sir?
not_available Voldemort.
not_available I got it!
not_available treacherous little bleeder!
not_available is there no one we can trust?
not_available they kidnapped her
not_available because he supported me.
not_available He was just desperate.

not_available Tell me who posseses it.
not_available The elder wand lies with him
not_available ofcourse...
not_available Buried in the earth.

not_available The hallows exist
not_available He is only after one... the last one
not_available He knows where it is.
not_available he's gonna have it by the end of the night?.
not_available you know who's had the elder wand.
not_available Do not touch her!
not_available Your boyfriend will get much worse for that
not_available if he doesn't learn to behave himself
not_available And what happened to you, ugly?
not_available No, not you.
not_available What is your name?
not_available Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
not_available Check it.

not_available What do they call you?
not_available Penelope Clearwater
not_available Half blood
not_available There is no Vernon Dudley on here.
not_available You hear that ugly?

not_available Change of plan.
not_available We are not taking this lot to the Ministry.

not_available Look closely, son.
not_available If we are the ones who
not_available hand Potter to the Dark Lord...

not_available it would all be as it was understood ?
not_available Now we won't be forgetting
not_available who really caught him ...
not_available ...I hope Mr Malfoy.
not_available Don't dare to talk to me like that in my own house
not_available Lucius!
not_available Do not be shy, come closer!
not_available If this isn't who you
not_available think it is Draco ...
not_available ... and we will call Him,
not_available He'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure!
not_available Whats wrong with his face?
