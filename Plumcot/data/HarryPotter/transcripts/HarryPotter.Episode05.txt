not_available I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it?
not_available And it's going to get even worse.
not_available Temperatures up in the mid30s Celsius... that's the mid
not_available 90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
not_available So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
not_available Come on, guys, time to go home.
not_available Come on, love, off you get.
not_available Do we have to?
not_available Yes, we do.
not_available I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate.
not_available He squealed like a pig, didn't he?
not_available Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
not_available Did you see his face?
not_available Hey, Big D.
not_available Beat up another.
not_available This one deserved it.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Five against one, very brave.
not_available Well, you're one to talk.
not_available Moaning in your sleep every night?
not_available At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
not_available "Don't kill Cedric."
not_available Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
not_available Shut up.
not_available "He's going to kill me, Mum."
not_available Where is your mum?
not_available Where is your mum, Potter?
not_available She dead?
not_available Is she dead?
not_available Is she a dead Pott...?
not_available Dudley.
not_available Dudley, let's go.
not_available What's going on?
not_available What are you doing?
not_available I'm not doing anything.
not_available We're getting out of here, Dudley.
not_available Come on, Dudley, hurry up.
not_available Dudley, run.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available Mrs. Figg.
not_available Don't put away your wand, Harry.
not_available They might come back.
not_available Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
not_available Whole world's gone topsyturvy. 
not_available I don't understand. How do you know...?
not_available Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
not_available Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?
not_available After YouKnow
not_available Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year... did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own?
not_available Good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent.
not_available Now, get inside and stay there.
not_available Expect someone will be in touch soon.
not_available Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
not_available It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
not_available There's sweat. There's stifling.
not_available Diddykins?
not_available Is that you?
not_available Duddy. Vernon, come quick.
not_available We're going to have to take him to a hospital.
not_available Who did this to you, boy?
not_available Happy, are we, now?
not_available You've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy.
not_available Vernon, don't say that.
not_available Well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.
not_available I've reached my limit, do you hear?
not_available This is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense.
not_available Dear Mr. Potter.
not_available What?
not_available The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening... you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
not_available As a clear violation... of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... you are hereby expelled... from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
not_available Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
not_available Justice.
not_available He's not very well.
not_available Sorry, Hedwig.
not_available Very clean, these Muggles.
not_available Tonks, for God's sake.
not_available Unnatural.
not_available Professor Moody.
not_available What are you doing here?
not_available Rescuing you, of course.
not_available But where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled.
not_available You haven't been. Not yet.
not_available Kingsley, you take point.
not_available But the letter said...
not_available Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion... pending a formal hearing.
not_available A hearing?
not_available Don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.
not_available Not here, Nymphadora.
not_available Don't call me Nymphadora.
not_available Stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.
not_available Come on, you, around the corner.
not_available Come on.
not_available In you go, son.
not_available There've been no sightings.
not_available No deaths. No proof.
not_available He almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough...
not_available Yes, but guarding youknow
not_available what is the most important...
not_available We must trust Dumbledore on this.
not_available Was he able to protect Harry last year?
not_available Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
not_available Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second.
not_available His instinct would be to ignore it...
not_available Keep your voices down.
not_available He's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now.
not_available Harry.
not_available Mrs. Weasley.
not_available Heavens, you're all right.
not_available Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished.
not_available Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left.
not_available Yeah.
not_available Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
not_available If my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house... what would she say to old Kreacher?
not_available Oh, the shame.
not_available Freaks.
not_available There, there, mistress.
not_available Scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers.
not_available Kreacher is here.
not_available Oh, Harry.
not_available Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack.
not_available You must tell us everything.
not_available Let the man breathe, Hermione.
not_available And this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous.
not_available I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you.
not_available It's completely unfair.
not_available Yeah.
not_available There's a lot of that going round at the moment.
not_available So, what is this place?
not_available It's headquarters.
not_available Of the Order of the Phoenix.
not_available It's a secret society.
not_available Dumbledore formed it back when they fought YouKnow
not_available Who.
not_available Couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose?
not_available I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
not_available We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.
not_available Only...
not_available Only what?
not_available Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.
not_available Dumbledore said that?
not_available But why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help.
not_available I'm the one who saw Voldemort return... the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
not_available Harry.
not_available Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
not_available Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
not_available If you're all done shouting...
not_available Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting?
not_available If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry... we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back.
not_available He's not a child, Molly.
not_available But he's not an adult either.
not_available He's not James, Sirius.
not_available Well, he's not your son.
not_available He's as good as.
not_available Who else has he got?
not_available Hey, Ginny.
not_available He's got me.
not_available How touchingly paternal, Black.
not_available Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.
not_available Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
not_available Snape's part of the Order?
not_available Git.
not_available ...about your supposed reformation.
not_available I know better.
not_available So why don't you tell him?
not_available Get off it.
not_available Quick.
not_available Get it up.
not_available Crookshanks.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Get off, you bloody cat.
not_available Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
not_available Get it up.
not_available Hermione, I hate your cat.
not_available Bad Crookshanks.
not_available Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
not_available Just because you're allowed to use magic now... does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything.
not_available Hi, Mum.
not_available You hungry, Harry?
not_available You sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
not_available Harry Potter.
not_available Sirius.
not_available This is very, very peculiar.
not_available It seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
not_available I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me?
not_available Show him. He'll find out soon enough.
not_available He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
not_available Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet... to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.
not_available Why?
not_available He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
not_available No one in their right mind could believe that...
not_available Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind.
not_available It's been twisted and warped by fear.
not_available Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry.
not_available The last time Voldemort gained power... he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear.
not_available Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything... to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
not_available We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again.
not_available Fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command.
not_available And not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures.
not_available He's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same.
not_available But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in.
not_available We believe... Voldemort may be after something.
not_available Sirius.
not_available Something he didn't have last time.
not_available You mean like a weapon?
not_available No. That's enough. He's just a boy.
not_available You say more and you might as well induct him into the Order.
not_available Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight.
not_available Harry.
not_available You are hereby expelled.
not_available Before the entire Wizengamot.
not_available Trains. Underground.
not_available Ingenious, these Muggles.
not_available Here we are.
not_available I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun.
not_available Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
not_available Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market.
not_available Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
Dumbledore Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
not_available Morning, Arthur.
not_available Morning, Bob.
not_available Interdepartmental memos.
not_available We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
not_available Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
not_available They've changed the time of your hearing.
not_available When is it?
not_available In five minutes.
not_available Department of Mysteries.
not_available And I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing.
not_available Yes, but we must be...
not_available Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to.
not_available Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
not_available As the Muggles say, truth will out.
not_available Yes?
not_available I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
not_available Good luck, Harry.
not_available Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August... into offenses committed by Harry James Potter... resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
not_available Witness for the defense.
not_available Albus Percival Wulfric... Brian Dumbledore.
not_available You got our message that the time and place of the hearing... had been changed, did you?
not_available I must have missed it.
not_available But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.
not_available The charges?
not_available The charges against the accused are as follows:
not_available "That he did knowingly... and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions... produce a Patronus Charm... in the presence of a Muggle."
not_available Do you deny producing said Patronus?
not_available No, but...
not_available And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school... while under the age of 17?
not_available Yes, I was, but...
not_available Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
not_available I was only doing it because of the Dementors.
not_available Dementors?
not_available In Little Whinging?
not_available That's quite clever.
not_available Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?
not_available Highly convenient.
not_available I'm not lying.
not_available There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
not_available Enough.
not_available I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well
not_available rehearsed story... but since you can produce no witnesses of the event...
not_available Pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can.
not_available Please describe the attack.
not_available What did they look like?
not_available Well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny.
not_available Not the boys. The Dementors.
not_available Oh, right, right. Well, big.
not_available Cloaked. Then everything went cold... as though all the happiness had gone from the world.
not_available Now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb... and happen across a wizard.
not_available The odds are astronomical.
not_available I don't think anyone would believe... the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister.
not_available I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor.
not_available Dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic.
not_available And it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though... you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.
not_available That would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary... which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full
not_available scale inquiry... into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban... and why they mounted an attack without authorization.
not_available Of course, there is someone... who might be behind the attack.
not_available Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
not_available The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible.
not_available He is not back.
not_available In the matter of Harry Potter... the law clearly states... that magic may be used before Muggles in life
not_available threatening situations.
not_available Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.
not_available Clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial... to deal with a simple matter of underage magic?
not_available Those in favor of conviction?
not_available Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?
not_available Cleared of all charges.
not_available Professor.
not_available Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
not_available You'll blow the entire operation.
not_available Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you...
not_available I had to see you off, didn't I?
not_available What's life without a little risk?
not_available I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban.
not_available Don't worry about me.
not_available Anyway, I wanted you to have this.
not_available Original Order of the Phoenix.
not_available Marlene McKinnon.
not_available She was killed two weeks after this was taken.
not_available Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
not_available Frank and Alice Longbottom.
not_available Neville's parents.
not_available They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me.
not_available It's been 14 years.
not_available And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.
not_available Do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius?
not_available It feels like it did before.
not_available You keep it.
not_available Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
not_available I'll see you at the train.
not_available Bye
not_available bye, darling.
not_available I love you.
not_available Hold my hand, lovey.
not_available There they are. They're in the far carriage.
not_available Bye.
not_available I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free.
not_available Better enjoy it while you can.
not_available I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it.
not_available What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
not_available Just stay away from me!
not_available It's only Malfoy.
not_available What'd you expect?
not_available Hi, guys.
not_available Hey, Neville.
not_available Hey there, Neville.
not_available What is it?
not_available What's what?
not_available That. Pulling the carriage.
not_available Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
not_available It's pulling itself, like always.
not_available You're not going mad.
not_available I can see them too.
not_available You're just as sane as I am.
not_available Everyone, this is Loony Love...
not_available Luna Lovegood.
not_available What an interesting necklace.
not_available It's a charm, actually.
not_available Keeps away the Nargles.
not_available Hungry.
not_available I hope there's pudding.
not_available What's a Nargle?
not_available No idea.
not_available Good evening, children.
not_available Now, we have two changes in staffing this year.
not_available We're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly
not_available Plank... who'll be taking Care of Magical Creatures... while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave.
not_available We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Professor Dolores Umbridge.
not_available And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck.
not_available Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr.
not_available Filch, has asked me to remind you...
not_available She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
not_available Thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome.
not_available And how lovely to see all your bright... happy faces smiling up at me.
not_available I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends.
not_available That's likely.
not_available That's likely.
not_available The Ministry of Magic has always considered... the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.
not_available Although each headmaster... has brought something new to this historic school... progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged.
not_available Let us preserve what must be preserved... perfect what can be perfected... and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.
not_available Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
not_available That really was most illuminating.
not_available Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
not_available What's it mean?
not_available Magic is forbidden in the corridors...
not_available It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
not_available Dean, Seamus.
not_available Good holiday?
not_available All right.
not_available Better than Seamus', anyway.
not_available Me mum didn't want me to come back this year.
not_available Why not?
not_available Let me see. Because of you.
not_available The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.
not_available What, your mum believes them?
not_available Nobody was there the night Cedric died.
not_available I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother.
not_available Don't talk about my mother.
not_available I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.
not_available What's going on?
not_available He's mad, is what's going on.
not_available Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about YouKnow
not_available Who?
not_available Yeah. I do.
not_available Has anyone else got a problem with Harry?
not_available You all right?
not_available Fine.
not_available Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
not_available But he'll come through, you'll see.
not_available I said, I'm fine, Ron.
not_available Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then.
not_available Harry.
not_available Bring it over here. Over here.
not_available Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
not_available Good morning, children.
not_available Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.
not_available OW
not_available Ls.
not_available More commonly known as OWLs.
not_available Study hard and you will be rewarded.
not_available Fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe.
not_available Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven.
not_available But you'll be pleased to know, from now on... you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry
not_available approved... course of defensive magic. Yes?
not_available There's nothing in here about using defensive spells?
not_available Using spells?
not_available Well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.
not_available We're not gonna use magic?
not_available You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk
not_available free way.
not_available What use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk
not_available free.
not_available Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class.
not_available It is the view of the Ministry... that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient... to get you through your examinations... which, after all, is what school is all about.
not_available And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
not_available There is nothing out there, dear.
not_available Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself?
not_available Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
not_available Now, let me make this quite plain.
not_available You have been told... that a certain dark wizard is at large once again.
not_available This is a lie.
not_available It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
not_available Detention, Mr. Potter.
not_available Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
not_available Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
not_available It was murder. Voldemort killed him.
not_available Enough!
not_available Enough.
not_available See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
not_available Come in.
not_available Good evening, Mr. Potter.
not_available Sit.
not_available You're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
not_available No, not with your quill.
not_available Going to be using a rather special one of mine.
not_available Now... I want you to write, "I must not tell lies."
not_available How many times?
not_available Well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
not_available You haven't given me any ink.
not_available Oh, you won't need any ink.
not_available Yes?
not_available Nothing.
not_available That's right.
not_available Because you know, deep down... you deserve to be punished.
not_available Don't you, Mr. Potter?
not_available Go on.
not_available Skiving Snackboxes.
not_available Sweets that make you ill.
not_available Get out of class whenever you like.
not_available Obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom.
not_available Care for another?
not_available I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
not_available I've been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams.
not_available I'll do the introduction. That's all.
not_available Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.
not_available And if I'm ever rude to you again...
not_available I'll know you've gone back to normal.
not_available What's wrong with your hand?
not_available Nothing.
not_available The other hand.
not_available You've got to tell Dumbledore.
not_available No.
not_available Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.
not_available I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.
not_available Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.
not_available If the parents knew about this...
not_available I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
not_available Harry, you've got to report this.
not_available It's perfectly simple. You're being...
not_available No, it's not.
not_available Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.
not_available You don't understand.
not_available Then help us to.
not_available Dear Padfoot... I hope you're all right.
not_available It's starting to get colder here.
not_available Winter is definitely on the way.
not_available In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever.
not_available I know you, of all people, will understand.
not_available Hello, Harry Potter.
not_available Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
not_available Bit.
not_available Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared.
not_available I suspect Nargles are behind it.
not_available What are they?
not_available They're called Thestrals.
not_available They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit...
not_available Different.
not_available But why can't the others see them?
not_available They can only be seen by people who've seen death.
not_available So you've known someone who's died, then?
not_available My mum.
not_available She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment... and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong.
not_available I was 9.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available Yes, it was rather horrible.
not_available I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad.
not_available We both believe you, by the way.
not_available That HeWhoMustNotBe
not_available Named is back, and you fought him... and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you.
not_available Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.
not_available I don't think that's true.
not_available But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available Well, if I were YouKnow
not_available Who... I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else... because if it's just you alone... you're not as much of a threat.
not_available Do you ever stop eating?
not_available What? I'm hungry.
not_available Harry.
not_available Can I join you?
not_available Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?
not_available I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students... you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.
not_available So silly of me, but it sounds... as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom... Minerva.
not_available Not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods.
not_available I am sorry, dear.
not_available But to question my practices is to question the Ministry... and by extension, the minister himself.
not_available I am a tolerant woman... but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty.
not_available Disloyalty.
not_available Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared.
not_available Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
not_available What's happened to Dumbledore?
not_available Having already revolutionized... the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts... Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers... to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School.
not_available Just one question, dear.
not_available You've been in this post how long, exactly?
not_available You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
not_available Yes.
not_available But you were unsuccessful?
not_available Obviously.
not_available Could you please predict something for me?
not_available I'm sorry?
not_available Move those mouths.
not_available One teensy little prophecy?
not_available Pity.
not_available No, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something.
not_available Yes, I do. Something dark.
not_available You are in grave danger.
not_available Lovely.
not_available Cho. What's going on?
not_available It's Professor Trelawney.
not_available Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
not_available Hogwarts is my home.
not_available You can't do this.
not_available Actually, I can.
not_available Something you'd like to say?
not_available Oh, there are several things I would like to say.
not_available There...
not_available Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?
not_available Sybil, dear. This way.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms... of Educational Decree Number You have the right to dismiss my teachers.
not_available You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds.
not_available That power remains with the headmaster.
not_available For now.
not_available Don't you all have studying to do?
not_available Professor.
not_available Professor?
not_available Professor Dumbledore. Professor!
not_available Professor Dumbledore.
not_available That foul, evil, old gargoyle.
not_available We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
not_available We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.
not_available She's taking over the entire school.
not_available Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority.
not_available Furthermore, we have convincing evidence... that these disappearances are the work... of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
not_available Harry.
not_available Sirius.
not_available What are you doing here?
not_available Answering your letter.
not_available You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing?
not_available Training you to kill half
not_available breeds?
not_available She's not letting us use magic at all.
not_available Well, I'm not surprised.
not_available The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.
not_available Combat?
not_available What does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army?
not_available That's exactly what he thinks.
not_available That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry.
not_available He's becoming more paranoid by the minute.
not_available The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry... but things aren't going at all well with the Order.
not_available Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn... and these disappearances are just how it started before.
not_available Voldemort is on the move.
not_available Well, what can we do?
not_available Someone's coming.
not_available I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
not_available But for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own.
not_available He really is out there, isn't he?
not_available We've got to be able to defend ourselves.
not_available And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will.
not_available Harry.
not_available This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
not_available I'm a nutter, remember?
not_available Look on the bright 
side you can't be any worse than old toad face.
not_available Thanks, Ron.
not_available I'm here for you, mate.
not_available Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
not_available Just a couple of people.
not_available Lovely spot.
not_available Thought it would be safer off the beaten track.
not_available Matey, come back here.
not_available Hi.
not_available So you all know why we're here.
not_available We need a teacher.
not_available A proper teacher.
not_available One who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.
not_available Why?
not_available Why?
not_available Because YouKnow
not_available Who's back, you tosspot.
not_available So he says.
not_available So Dumbledore says.
not_available So Dumbledore says because he says.
not_available The point is, where's the proof?
not_available If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...
not_available I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now.
not_available Come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some sort of freak.
not_available Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?
not_available Yes.
not_available I've seen it.
not_available Blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that.
not_available And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.
not_available It's true.
not_available Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once.
not_available Last year, he really did fight off YouKnow
not_available Who in the flesh.
not_available Wait.
not_available Look, it all sounds great when you say it like that... but the truth is, most of that was just luck.
not_available I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help.
not_available He's just being modest.
not_available No, Hermione, I'm not.
not_available Facing this stuff in real life is not like school.
not_available In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow.
not_available But out there... when you're a second away from being murdered... or watching a friend die right before your eyes...
not_available You don't know what that's like.
not_available You're right, Harry, we don't.
not_available That's why we need your help.
not_available Because if we're going to have any chance at beating... Voldemort...
not_available He's really back.
not_available Right. First we need to find a place to practice... where Umbridge won't find out.
not_available The Shrieking Shack.
not_available It's too small.
not_available Forbidden Forest?
not_available Not bloody likely.
not_available Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?
not_available Who cares?
not_available I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?
not_available Who are you and what have you done with Hermione?
not_available Anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today.
not_available What's that?
not_available Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
not_available Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up... with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice.
not_available We've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us.
not_available Will do, Harry.
not_available All student organizations are henceforth disbanded.
not_available Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
not_available Watch where you're going, Longbottom.
not_available You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.
not_available The what?
not_available It's also known as the Come and Go Room.
not_available The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it.
not_available And it's always equipped for the seeker's needs.
not_available So say you really needed the toilet...
not_available Charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea.
not_available It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available I'm hopeless.
not_available You're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
not_available You will please copy the approved text four times... to ensure maximum retention.
not_available There will be no need to talk.
not_available No need to think's more like it.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Wands away.
not_available Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.
not_available It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
not_available So come on, then, Nigel.
not_available Give it your best shot.
not_available Stupefy!
not_available Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
not_available Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
not_available Thanks, Ronald.
not_available Come on, Ron.
not_available Come on, Ron.
not_available You can do it.
not_available Come on, Ron.
not_available One Sickle.
not_available You're on.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Shut up.
not_available I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it?
not_available It was completely intentional.
not_available Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
not_available Now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Very good. Keep your concentration.
not_available Great.
not_available A little higher.
not_available I'm okay. I'm okay.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... may sign up in the high inquisitor's office.
not_available Diminuendo.
not_available Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even 
more Believing in yourself.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Levicorpus. Got it.
not_available Think of it this way.
not_available Every great wizard in history has started out... as nothing more than what we are 
now students.
not_available If they can do it, why not us?
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Reducto.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Expelliarmus.
not_available Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
not_available So that's it for this lesson.
not_available Now, we' re not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays.
not_available So just keep practicing on your own as best you can.
not_available And well done, everyone. Great, great work.
not_available Well done, mate.
not_available Thanks.
not_available See you after Christmas.
not_available See you in the Common Room, Harry.
not_available Thanks a lot, Harry.
not_available No worries.
not_available Thank you so much.
not_available Not at all. Merry Christmas.
not_available Thank you, Harry.
not_available Thank you. Merry Christmas.
not_available Merry Christmas.
not_available Have a good Christmas.
not_available Have a great Christmas, Luna.
not_available We've been thinking.
not_available We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles.
not_available Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus
not_available filled boils...
not_available Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
not_available Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.
not_available Yeah. I'm okay.
not_available Anyway, it's worth it.
not_available It's just, learning all this... makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it...
not_available Cedric did know this stuff.
not_available He was really good.
not_available It's just, Voldemort was better.
not_available You're a really good teacher, Harry.
not_available I've never been able to stun anything before.
not_available Mistletoe.
not_available Probably full of Nargles, though.
not_available What are Nargles?
not_available No idea.
not_available Well, how was it?
not_available Wet.
not_available I mean, she was sort of crying.
not_available That bad at it, are you?
not_available I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory.
not_available Cho spends half her time crying these days.
not_available You'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.
not_available Don't you understand how she must be feeling?
not_available Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric... and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him... conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry... and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything.
not_available One person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode.
not_available Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
not_available Harry.
not_available Voldemort may be after something.
not_available Something he didn't have last time.
not_available Harry.
not_available Harry.
not_available In the dream, were you standing next to the victim... or looking down at the scene?
not_available Neither. It was like I...
not_available Will you please just tell me what's happening?
not_available Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
not_available Make sure he's found by the right people.
not_available Sir.
not_available Phineas.
not_available You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place.
not_available Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured... and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey.
not_available They've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it.
not_available What's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
not_available Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
not_available Look at me!
not_available What's happening to me?
not_available You wished to see me, headmaster?
not_available Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning.
not_available Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
not_available It appears there's a connection... between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
not_available Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear.
not_available Pray he remains ignorant.
not_available You mean, if he knows about it, then... he'll be able to read my mind?
not_available Read it, control it... unhinge it.
not_available In the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure... to invade the minds of his victims... creating visions designed to torture them into madness.
not_available Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony... only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally... kill them.
not_available Used properly, the power of Occlumency... will help shield you from access or influence.
not_available In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind.
not_available You will attempt to resist.
not_available Prepare yourself.
not_available Legilimens.
not_available Concentrate, Potter. Focus.
not_available Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
not_available Here we go.
not_available Daddy's back.
not_available Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents.
not_available And a nice big box for Ron.
not_available Big box for you. And...
not_available Fred and George. Come on, open up.
not_available I want to see your faces.
not_available Yes.
not_available Try it on.
not_available Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
not_available Just what he wanted, actually.
not_available Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
not_available Come on, then, everybody.
not_available Let's clear this away.
not_available Oh, Harry, Harry.
not_available There you are.
not_available Happy Christmas.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Lovely to have you with us.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
not_available Thank you.
not_available Has everybody got?
not_available Fred? George?
not_available Hermione.
not_available A Christmas toast.
not_available To Mr. Harry Potter... without whom I would not be here.
not_available Harry.
not_available Harry.
not_available Harry.
not_available That is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that.
not_available Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
not_available I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
not_available I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
not_available No more than usual, Ron.
not_available I don't know why...
not_available Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
not_available Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
not_available Friend of Mudbloods and blood
not_available traitors alike.
not_available If my poor mistress only knew...
not_available Kreacher!
not_available That's enough of your bile. Away with you!
not_available Of course, master.
not_available Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black.
not_available Sorry about that.
not_available He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy.
not_available Not to me, anyway.
not_available What, you grew up here?
not_available This is my parents' house.
not_available I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order.
not_available About the only useful thing I've been able to do.
not_available This is the Black family tree.
not_available My deranged cousin.
not_available I hated the lot of them.
not_available My parents with their pure
not_available blood mania.
not_available My mother did that after I ran away.
not_available Charming woman.
not_available I was 16.
not_available Where did you go?
not_available Round your dad's.
not_available I was always welcome at the Potters'.
not_available I see him so much in you, Harry.
not_available You are so very much alike.
not_available I'm not so sure.
not_available Sirius, when I was...
not_available When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching.
not_available I was the snake.
not_available And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office... there was a moment when I wanted to...
not_available This connection between me and Voldemort.
not_available What if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him?
not_available I just feel so angry all the time.
not_available And what if, after everything that I've been through... something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?
not_available I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry.
not_available You're not a bad person.
not_available You're a very good person who bad things have happened to.
not_available You understand?
not_available Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.
not_available We've all got both light and dark inside of us.
not_available What matters is the part we choose to act on.
not_available That's who we really are.
not_available Harry, time to go.
not_available When all this is over, we'll be a proper family.
not_available You'll see.
not_available Come on.
not_available Really?
not_available Harry. Harry.
not_available Hagrid's back.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I will say this one last time.
not_available I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
not_available I told you. I've been away for me health.
not_available Your health?
not_available Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
not_available Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by.
not_available If I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back.
not_available In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
not_available This is top
not_available secret, right?
not_available Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
not_available Giants?
not_available You found them?
not_available Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
not_available I tried to convince them to join the cause.
not_available But I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over.
not_available Death Eaters?
not_available Yes.
not_available Trying to persuade them to join YouKnow
not_available Who.
not_available Did they?
not_available I gave them Dumbledore's message.
not_available Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose.
not_available And they did this to you?
not_available Not exactly, no.
not_available Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
not_available It's changing out there.
not_available Just like last time.
not_available There's a storm coming, Harry.
not_available We'd all best be ready when she does.
not_available We have confirmed that 10 high
not_available security prisoners... in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape.
not_available And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger.
not_available We strongly suspect... that the breakout was engineered... by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban... notorious mass murderer Sirius Black... cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
not_available Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
not_available He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.
not_available Harry.
not_available I wanted to apologize.
not_available Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.
not_available So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.
not_available Neville?
not_available Fourteen years ago... a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange... used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
not_available She tortured them for information... but they never gave in.
not_available I'm quite proud to be their son.
not_available But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
not_available We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.
not_available Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember.
not_available Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
not_available George, your turn now.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available A full
not_available bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce... but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents.
not_available Wow, that was really good.
not_available Fantastic, Ginny.
not_available Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused.
not_available So focus, Luna.
not_available Think of the happiest thing you can.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available I'm trying.
not_available I know. It's good.
not_available This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well.
not_available Expecto Patronum.
not_available I'll make short work of this.
not_available Bombarda Maxima.
not_available Get them.
not_available Been watching them for weeks.
not_available And see, " Dumbledore's Army"... proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius.
not_available All your fearmongering about YouKnow
not_available Who... never fooled us for a minute.
not_available We saw your lies for what they 
were A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.
not_available Naturally.
not_available No, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me.
not_available Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out... the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."
not_available I instructed Harry to form this organization.
not_available And I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.
not_available Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
not_available If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition.
not_available Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore... to Azkaban... to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
not_available I thought we might hit this little snag.
not_available You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to...
not_available What was the phrase?
not_available ...come quietly.
not_available Well, I can tell you 
this I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
not_available Enough of this.
not_available Take him.
not_available Well, you may not like him, minister... but you can't deny... Dumbledore has got style.
not_available Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other.
not_available Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
not_available Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities.
not_available Any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
not_available Harry.
not_available You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
not_available Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
not_available Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
not_available Yeah, we talked you into it.
not_available Yeah, but I agreed.
not_available I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse.
not_available Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
not_available Because I don't want to play anymore.
not_available All it does is make you care too much.
not_available And the more you care, the more you have to lose.
not_available So maybe it's just better to...
not_available To what?
not_available To go it alone.
not_available Hagrid.
not_available Any idea where he's taking us?
not_available Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
not_available I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
not_available And they're dangerous at the best of times.
not_available The Ministry restricts their territory much more... they'll have a full uprising on their hands.
not_available Hagrid, what's going on?
not_available I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
not_available I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone... I'll likely be getting the sack any day now.
not_available And I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him.
not_available Grawpy.
not_available Down here, you great buffoon.
not_available Grawpy.
not_available Brought you some company.
not_available I couldn't just leave him, because...
not_available Because he's my brother.
not_available Blimey.
not_available Well, half brother, really.
not_available He's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high
not_available spirited, is all.
not_available Grawpy, that is not polite.
not_available Hagrid, do something.
not_available We talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
not_available That's your new friend, Hermione.
not_available Grawpy.
not_available Grawp.
not_available Put me down!
not_available Now!
not_available You all right?
not_available Fine.
not_available Just needs a firm hand, is all.
not_available I think you've got an admirer.
not_available You just stay away from her, all right?
not_available He gets his own food and all.
not_available It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
not_available You will look after him, won't you?
not_available I'm the only family he's got.
not_available Feeling sentimental?
not_available That's private.
not_available Not to me.
not_available And not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve.
not_available Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you.
not_available You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind.
not_available You're just like your father.
not_available Lazy, arrogant.
not_available Don't say a word against my father.
not_available Weak.
not_available I'm not weak.
not_available Then prove it.
not_available Control your emotions.
not_available Discipline your mind.
not_available Legilimens.
not_available Harry.
not_available Sirius.
not_available I may vomit.
not_available Stop it.
not_available Is this what you call control?
not_available We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest.
not_available The Dark Lord isn't resting.
not_available You and Black, you're two of a kind.
not_available Sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
not_available Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair.
not_available Your blessed father knew that.
not_available In fact, he frequently saw to it.
not_available My father was a great man.
not_available Your father was a swine.
not_available Legilimens.
not_available Protego.
not_available Come on, Moony, Padfoot.
not_available Snape. Expelliarmus.
not_available Nice one, James.
not_available Dad.
not_available Impedimenta.
not_available Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
not_available Right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?
not_available Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
not_available Enough.
not_available Enough.
not_available Your lessons are at an end.
not_available I...
not_available Get out.
not_available What's your name?
not_available Michael.
not_available Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
not_available Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
not_available It's fading already.
not_available You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while.
not_available As I told you once before, Mr. Potter... naughty children deserve to be punished.
not_available You know, George... I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.
not_available Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing.
not_available All right, professor!
not_available Here you go.
not_available Ready when you are.
not_available I need that prophecy.
not_available You'll have to kill me.
not_available Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me.
not_available Crucio.
not_available Crucio.
not_available Sirius.
not_available Harry, are you sure?
not_available I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
not_available It's the door I've been dreaming about.
not_available I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
not_available Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
not_available Something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries.
not_available Harry, please, just listen.
not_available What if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
not_available What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?
not_available What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die?
not_available Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
not_available What do we do?
not_available We'll have to use the Floo Network.
not_available Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
not_available Not all of them.
not_available Alohomora.
not_available Alert the Order if you can.
not_available Are you mental? We're going with you.
not_available It's too dangerous.
not_available When are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together.
not_available That you are.
not_available Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl.
not_available You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
not_available No.
not_available Liar.
not_available You sent for me, headmistress?
not_available Snape, yes.
not_available The time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not.
not_available Have you brought the Veritaserum?
not_available I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students.
not_available The last of it on Miss Chang.
not_available Unless you wish to poison him...
not_available And I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did.
not_available ...I cannot help you.
not_available He's got Padfoot.
not_available He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.
not_available Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
not_available Where what is hidden?
not_available What is he talking about, Snape?
not_available No idea.
not_available Very well.
not_available You give me no choice, Potter.
not_available As this is an issue of Ministry security... you leave me with... no alternative.
not_available The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.
not_available That's illegal.
not_available What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
not_available Tell her, Harry!
not_available Tell me what?
not_available Well, if you won't tell her where it is... I will.
not_available Where what is?
not_available Dumbledore's secret weapon.
not_available How much further?
not_available Not far.
not_available It had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available Improvising.
not_available Well?
not_available Where is this weapon?
not_available There isn't one, is there?
not_available You were trying to trick me.
not_available You know... I really hate children.
not_available You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
not_available Lower your weapons.
not_available I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near
not_available human intelligence...
not_available Protego.
not_available How dare you?
not_available Filthy half
not_available breed.
not_available Incarcerous.
not_available Please. Please stop it. Please.
not_available Now, enough. I will have order.
not_available You filthy animal.
not_available Do you know who I am?
not_available Leave him alone. It's not his fault.
not_available No, he doesn't understand.
not_available Potter, do something.
not_available Tell them I mean no harm.
not_available I'm sorry, professor.
not_available But I must not tell lies.
not_available What are you doing?
not_available I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge!
not_available Let me go!
not_available Thank you, Grawp.
not_available Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
not_available How'd you get away?
not_available Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
not_available Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
not_available They told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.
not_available That was clever, Ron.
not_available Has been known to happen.
not_available It was brilliant.
not_available So how are we getting to London?
not_available Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you... but I've got you into enough trouble as it is.
not_available Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real.
not_available Or was that all just words to you?
not_available Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.
not_available So how are we going to get to London?
not_available We fly, of course.
not_available Department of Mysteries.
not_available This is it.
not_available Ninety
not_available two.
not_available Ninety
not_available three.
not_available Ninety
not_available four.
not_available Ninety
not_available five.
not_available He should be here.
not_available Harry.
not_available It's got your name on it.
not_available The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
not_available And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal... but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.
not_available For neither can live while the other survives.
not_available Harry.
not_available Where's Sirius?
not_available You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... and reality.
not_available You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see.
not_available Now, hand me the prophecy.
not_available If you do anything to us, I'll break it.
not_available He knows how to play.
not_available Itty, bitty baby.
not_available Potter.
not_available Bellatrix Lestrange.
not_available Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
not_available Better, now they're about to be avenged.
not_available Now, let's everybody just calm down... shall we?
not_available All we want is that prophecy.
not_available Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?
not_available You dare speak his name?
not_available You filthy half
not_available blood!
not_available It's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you?
not_available Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made.
not_available Which is lucky for you, really.
not_available Haven't you always wondered... what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord?
not_available Why he was unable to kill you... when you were just an infant?
not_available Don't you want to know the secret of your scar?
not_available All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand.
not_available All you have to do... is give it to me.
not_available Then I can show you everything.
not_available I've waited 14 years.
not_available I know.
not_available I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Levicorpus.
not_available Petrificus Totalus.
not_available Well done, Neville.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Stupefy.
not_available Reducto.
not_available Get back to the door.
not_available Department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they?
not_available The voices.
not_available Can you tell what they're saying?
not_available There aren't any voices, Harry.
not_available Let's get out of here.
not_available I hear them too.
not_available Harry, it's just an empty archway.
not_available Please, Harry.
not_available Get behind me.
not_available Did you actually believe... or were you truly naive enough to think... that children stood a chance against us?
not_available I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
not_available Give me the prophecy now... or watch your friends die.
not_available Don't give it to him, Harry.
not_available Get away from my godson.
not_available Now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here.
not_available What? No, I'm staying with you.
not_available You've done beautifully.
not_available Now, let me take it from here.
not_available Black.
not_available Expelliarmus!
not_available Nice one, James.
not_available Avada Kedavra.
not_available No. No.
not_available I killed Sirius Black.
not_available You coming to get me?
not_available Crucio.
not_available You've got to mean it, Harry.
not_available She killed him. She deserves it.
not_available You know the spell, Harry.
not_available Do it.
not_available So weak.
not_available It was foolish of you to come here tonight, T om.
not_available The Aurors are on their way.
not_available By which time I shall be gone, and you... shall be dead.
not_available You've lost, old man.
not_available Harry.
not_available So weak.
not_available So vulnerable.
not_available Look at me.
not_available Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
not_available It's how you are not.
not_available Harry?
not_available You're the weak one... and you'll never know love or friendship.
not_available And I feel sorry for you.
not_available You're a fool, Harry Potter.
not_available And you will lose everything.
not_available He's back.
not_available I know how you feel, Harry.
not_available No, you don't.
not_available It's my fault.
not_available No, the fault is mine.
not_available I knew it was only a matter of time... before Voldemort made the connection between you.
not_available I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year... he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected.
not_available The prophecy said:
not_available "Neither one can live while the other one survives."
not_available It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.
not_available Yes.
not_available Why didn't you tell me?
not_available For the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
not_available The same reason your friends saved you.
not_available After all these years, after all you've suffered... I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
not_available I cared too much about you.
not_available How come you're not at the feast?
not_available Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.
not_available That's awful.
not_available Oh, it's all good fun.
not_available But as it's the last night, I really do need them back.
not_available Do you want any help finding them?
not_available I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
not_available Are you sure you don't want any help looking?
not_available That's all right.
not_available Anyway, my mum always said... the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.
not_available If not always in the way we expect.
not_available Think I'll just go have some pudding.
not_available I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
not_available What's that?
not_available That even though we've got a fight ahead of us... we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
not_available Yeah?
not_available Something worth fighting for.
