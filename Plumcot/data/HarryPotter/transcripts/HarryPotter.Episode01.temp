dumbledore I should have known that you would be here...Professor mcgonagall.
mcgonagall Good evening, Professor dumbledore. Are the rumours true, albus?
dumbledore I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.
mcgonagall And the boy?
dumbledore hagrid is bringing him.
mcgonagall Do you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this?
albus Ah, Professor, I would trust hagrid with my life.
hagrid Professor dumbledore, Sir. Professor mcgonagall.
dumbledore No problems, I trust, hagrid?
hagrid No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
mcgonagall albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are
dumbledore The only family he has.
mcgonagall This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
dumbledore Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
dumbledore There, there, hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.
dumbledore Good luck...harry Potter.
petunia Up. Get up.

dudley Make it move.
vernon Move!
dudley MOVE!
harry He's asleep!
dudley He's boring.
harry Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.
harry Can you...hear me? I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.
dudley Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!
dudley Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!

harry
petunia It's all right. It's all right.
harry Ow!
vernon What happened?
harry I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
vernon There's no such thing as magic!
vernon Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.
dudley Dad, look! harry's got a letter!!
harry Hey, give it back! It's mine!
vernon Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
vernon No more mail through this letterbox.

vernon That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
dudley Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!
harry Make a wish, harry.
vernon Who's there? Ahh!
hagrid Sorry 'bout that.
vernon I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!
petunia Ooh.
hagrid Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.
all Ahh!
hagrid Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!
dudley I-I-I'm not harry.
harry appears I-I am.
hagrid Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. Words and all. Heh.
harry Thank you!
hagrid It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?
harry Excuse me, who are you?
hagrid Rubeus hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.
harry Sorry, no.
hagrid No? Blimey, harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
harry Learnt what?
hagrid You're a wizard, harry.
harry I-I'm a what?
harry A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.
harry No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... harry. Just harry.
hagrid Well, Just harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? Ah.
dudley
harry Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of witchcraft and Wizardry!
vernon Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!
harry You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?
petunia Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.
harry Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
hagrid A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
petunia We had to tell him something.
hagrid It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
vernon He'll not be going!
hagrid Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
harry Muggle?
hagrid Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen albus dumbledore.
vernon I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
hagrid Never insult albus dumbledore in front of me.
dudley Ahh!
all Ahh!
harry
hagrid Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
harry Okay.
hagrid
harry all students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?
hagrid If you know where to go.
barkeep tom Ah, hagrid! The usual, I presume?
hagrid No thanks, tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young harry here buy his school supplies.
tom Bless my soul. It's harry Potter.
man Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.
witch Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.
quirrell harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
hagrid Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. harry, this is Professor quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.
harry Oh, nice to meet you.
quirrell F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.
hagrid Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.
harry Good-bye.
hagrid See, harry, you're famous!
harry But why am I famous, hagrid? all those people back there, how is it they know who I am?
hagrid I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, harry.
hagrid Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.
boy It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.
harry But, hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.
hagrid Well there's your money, harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.
harry Uh, hagrid, what exactly are those things?
hagrid They're goblins, harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. Mr. harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
goblin And does Mr. harry Potter have his key?
hagrid Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which.
goblin Very well.
griphook Vault 687. Lamp, please.
hagrid Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?
griphook Vault 713.
harry What's in there, hagrid?
hagrid Can't tell you, harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.
griphook Stand back.
hagrid Best not mention this to anyone, harry.
harry I still need...a wand.
hagrid A wand? Well, you'll want ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.
harry Hello? Hello?
ollivander I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. Well, give it a wave.
harry Oh!
ollivander Apparently not. Curious, very curious.
harry Sorry, but what's curious?
ollivander I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar.
harry And...who owned that wand?
ollivander Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great.
hagrid harry! harry! Happy birthday!
harry Wow.
hagrid You all right, harry? You seem very quiet.
harry He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, hagrid, I know you do.
hagrid First, and understand this, harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...
harry Maybe if you wrote it down?
hagrid No, I can't spell it. all right. His name was voldemort.
harry voldemort?
hagrid Shh!!
hagrid It was dark times, harry, dark times. voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em.
harry Me? voldemort tried to kill...me?
hagrid Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.
harry What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?
hagrid Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.
hagrid What're you looking at? Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.
harry Platform 9 ¾? But hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there?
man Sorry.
harry Excuse me, excuse me.
trainmaster Right on your left, ma'am.
harry Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?
trainmaster 9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya?
mrs. weasley It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.
harry Muggles?
mrs. weasley Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! all right, percy, you first.
mrs. weasley fred, you next.
george He's not fred, I am!
fred Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!
mrs. weasley Oh, I'm sorry, george.
fred I'm only joking. I am fred.
harry Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to
mrs. weasley How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.
ginny Good luck.
ron Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.
harry No, not at all.
ron I'm ron, by the way. ron Weasley.
harry I'm harry. harry Potter.
ron So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...
harry The what?
ron Scar...?
harry Oh, yeah.
ron Wicked.
woman Anything off the trolley, dears?
ron
harry We'll take the lot!
ron Whoa!
harry Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?
ron They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. george sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!
harry These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?
ron It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.
frog Ribbit.
ron Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.
harry Hey, I got dumbledore!
ron I got about 6 of him.
harry Hey, he's gone!
ron Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?
harry Just a little bit.
ron fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?
harry Yeah!
ron Ahem. Sun-
hermione Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named neville's lost one.
ron No.
hermione Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
ron Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!
hermione Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example... That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're harry Potter. I'm hermione Granger...and you are...?
ron I'm...ron Weasley.
hermione Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon.
hagrid Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!
hagrid Hello, harry.
harry Hey, hagrid.
ron Whoaa!
hagrid Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.
ron Wicked.
mcgonagall Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup
neville Trevor!
mcgonagall The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.
draco It's true then, what they're saying on the train. harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
harry I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.
mcgonagall We're ready for you now.
hermione It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts A History.
mcgonagall all right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.
dumbledore I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. filch has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.
mcgonagall When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. hermione Granger.
hermione Oh, no. Okay, relax.
ron Mental that one, I'm telling you.
sorting hat Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!
mcgonagall draco Malfoy.
sorting hat SLYTHERIN!
ron There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.
mcgonagall Susan Bones.
harry Ahh!
ron harry, what is it?
harry Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.
sorting hat Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!
mcgonagall ronald Weasley.
sorting hat Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!
ron
mcgonagall harry Potter.
sorting hat Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?
harry Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.
sorting hat Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!
mcgonagall Your attention, please.
dumbledore Let the feast...begin.
harry Wow.
seamus I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
harry Say, percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor quirrell?
percy Oh, that's Professor snape, head of Slytherin house.
harry What's he teach?
percy Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after quirrells job for years.
ron Ahh!
nick Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.
hufflepuff ghost Whoo-hoo-hoo!
girl Look, its the Bloody Baron!
percy Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?
nick Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied.
ron Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless nick!
nick I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.
hermione Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
nick Like this.
ron Ahh!
hermione Eugh.
percy gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.
boy Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
percy This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.
percy Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on.
neville seamus, that picture's moving!
ron Look at that one, harry!
harry I think she fancies you.
girl Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?
man in painting Welcome to Hogwarts.
girl Who's that?
woman Password?
percy Caput draconis. Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.
girl Oh, wow.
percy Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.
ron Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old mcgonagall's face if we were late?
ron That was bloody brilliant.
mcgonagall Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.
harry We got lost.
mcgonagall Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
snape There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.
snape Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
harry I don't know, Sir.
snape And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?
harry I don't know, Sir.
snape Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?
seamus Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...
harry What's seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
ron Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...
ron Ah. Mail's here!
harry Can I borrow this? Thanks.
seamus Hey, look! neville's got a Remembrall!
hermione I've read about those. When the smoke turns red , it means you've forgotten something.
neville The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
harry Hey, ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault hagrid and I went to.
hooch Good afternoon, class.
class Good afternoon, Madam hooch.
hooch Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!
class Up!
harry Whoa.
draco Up!
hooch With feeling!
hermione Up. Up. Up. Up.
ron Up!!
hooch Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end.
neville Oh...
hooch Mr. Longbottom.
girl neville, what are you doing?
students neville...neville...
boy We're not supposed to take off, yet.
hooch M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!
neville AHH!
hooch Mr. Longbottom!
neville Down! Down! Ahhhh!
harry neville!
neville Help!!!
hooch Come back down this instant!
neville AHH!
neville Help!
hooch Mr. Longbottom!
neville Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! Ahh!
hooch Everyone out of the way! Come on, get up.
girl Is he alright?
neville Owowowow.
hooch Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get.
draco
harry Give it here, Malfoy.
draco No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?
hermione harry, no! You heard what Madam hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. What an idiot.
harry Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!
draco Is that so?
boy Good job, harry!
boy 2 Oh, that was wicked, harry.
mcgonagall
quirrell An iguana s-such as this is an essential in-gredient
mcgonagall Excuse me, excuse me, Professor quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?
quirrell Oh. Y-yes, of course.
mcgonagall Potter, this is oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!
nick Have you heard? harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.
ron Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in
harry A century, according to mcgonagall.
fred Hey, well done, harry, Wood's just told us!
ron fred and george are on the team, too. Beaters.
george Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.
fred Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from harry and ron, who walk across a courtyard.
george But they'll turn up in a month or two!!
ron Oh, go on, harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too!
harry But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
hermione You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.
ron Whoa. harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.
harry I-I didn't know.
ron I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
harry Who doesn't?
ron Ahh!
hermione
harry What's happening?
hermione The staircases change, remember?
harry Let's go this way.
ron Before the staircase moves again.
harry Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?
hermione We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.
harry Let's go.
ron It's filch's cat!
harry Run!
harry It's locked!
ron That's it, we're done for!
hermione Oh, move over!
ron Alohomora?
hermione Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.
filch Anyone here, my sweet?
hermione filch is gone.
ron Probably thinks this door's locked.
hermione It was locked.
harry And for good reason.
all AHHHHHHH!
ron What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.
hermione You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
ron I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!
hermione It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.
harry Guarding something?
hermione That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled!
ron She needs to sort out her priorities!
oliver Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. With me so far?
harry
oliver ...You better take this.
harry I like this ball.
oliver Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
harry What do I do with it?
oliver You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.
harry Whoa.
flitwick One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.
draco Wingardium Levio-saaa.
ron Wingardrium Leviosar.
hermione Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.
ron You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.
hermione
flitwick Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!
seamus Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa.
flitwick Whooaaa! Ooh.
harry I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
ron It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!
harry I think she heard you.
harry Where's hermione?
neville Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.
quirrell TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!!
dumbledore SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
girl Hufflepuff, this way!
boy Stay together!
percy gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!
harry How could a troll get in?
ron Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. What?
harry hermione! She doesn't know!
harry He's going into the girl's Bathroom!
harry hermione, move!
hermione Help! Help!
ron Hey, pea brain!
hermione Ahhh! Help!
harry Whooa! Whoa, whoa!
ron Ew.
harry Whoa, whoa whoa!
harry Do something!
ron What?
harry Anything! Hurry up!
hermione Swish and flick!
ron Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.
hermione Is it...dead?
harry I don't think so. Just knocked out. Ew. Troll bogies.
mcgonagall Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!
ron and harry Well, what it is...
hermione It's my fault, Professor mcgonagall.
mcgonagall Ms. Granger?
hermione I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If harry and ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
mcgonagall Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.
quirrell Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. Ahh! Hehe....
ron Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.
hermione ron's right, harry. You're gonna need your strength today.
harry I'm not hungry.
snape Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin.
harry That explains the blood.
hermione Blood?
harry Listen, last night, I'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
hermione But why would anyone go near that dog?
harry The day I was at Gringotts, hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.
hermione So you're saying...
harry That's what the dog's guarding. That's what snape wants.
hermione Bit early for mail, isn't it?
harry But I-I never get mail.
ron Let's open it.
harry It's a broomstick!
ron Thats not just any broomstick, harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!
harry But who...?
oiiver Scared, harry?
harry A little bit.
oliver That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
harry What happened?
oliver Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.
lee Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!
lee The players take their positions as Madam hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.
hooch Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you.
lee The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.
lee The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!
lee Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor!
harry Yes! Whoa!
hagrid Well done!
lee Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus flint.
ron and seamus Yay!
harry Yes!
lee Another 10 points to Gryffindor!
gryffindors Yay!
flint Give me that!
crowd
flint Take that side!
harry Whoa! Whooa!
hagrid What's going on with harry's broomstick?
hermione It's snape! He's jinxing the broom!
ron Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
hermione Leave it to me.
ron Come on, hermione!
hermione Lacarnum Inflamarae.
man Fire! You're on fire!
snape What? Oh!
ron Go!
hagrid Go go go!
hagrid Looks like he's gonna be sick!
lee He's got the Snitch! harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
hooch Gryffindor win!
all YAY!
draco No!
hagrid Yes!
hermione Whoo-hoo!
mcgonagall
crowd Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!
hagrid Nonsense. Why would snape put a curse on harry's broom?
harry Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?
hagrid Who told you 'bout Fluffy?
ron Fluffy?
hermione That thing has a name?
hagrid Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to dumbledore to guard the
harry Yes?
hagrid Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.
harry But hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, snape's trying to steal it!
hagrid Codswallop. Professor snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
hermione Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And snape wasn't blinking.
harry Exactly.
hagrid Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
harry Nicholas Flamel?
hagrid I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that.
harry Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?
hermione I don't know.
harry Knight to E-5.
ron Queen to E-5.
hermione That's totally barbaric!
ron That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.
hermione See you haven't.
ron Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!
hermione Good. You can help harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.
ron We've looked a hundred times!
hermione Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas.
ron I think we've had a bad influence on her.
ron harry, wake up! Come on harry, wake up!
ron Happy Christmas, harry.
harry Happy Christmas, ron. What are you wearing?
ron Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!
harry I've got presents?
ron Yeah!
harry Oh!
ron There they are.
harry "Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."
ron What is it?
harry Some kind of...cloak.
ron Well, let's see then. Put it on.
ron Whoa!
harry My body's gone!
ron I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!
harry I'm invisible??
ron They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.
harry There was no name. It just said, "Use it well."
harry Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?
man AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
filchs voice Who's there?! Who is it? Show yourself!
quirrell Severus...I-I thought...
snape You don't want me as your enemy, quirrell.
quirrell W-what do you m-mean?
snape You know perfectly well what I mean. We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
filch Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.
harry Mum? Dad? {nods and smiles. harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.
harry ron! You've really got to see this! ron! You've got to see this! ron, ron, come on. Get out of bed!
ron Why?
harry There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!
harry Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!
ron I only see me.
harry Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad
ron That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
harry How can it? Both my parents are dead.
dumbledore Back again, harry? I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
harry So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?
dumbledore Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, harry, and forget to live.
hermione I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
ron This is light?
hermione Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"
ron and harry The what?
hermione Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
ron Immortal?
hermione It means you'll never die.
ron I know what it means!
harry Shh!
hermione "The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!
harry hagrid!
hagrid
all 3 We know about the Philosopher's Stone!
hagrid Oh.
harry We think snape's trying to steal it.
hagrid snape? Blimey, harry, you're not still on about him, are you?
harry hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.
hagrid snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!
harry What?
hagrid You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.
harry Wait a minute. One of the teachers?
hermione Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.
hagrid That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.
harry Uh, hagrid, what exactly is that?
hagrid That? It's a ... its um...
ron I know what that is! But hagrid, how did you get one?
hagrid I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.
hermione Is that...a dragon?
ron That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.
hagrid Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert.
harry Norbert?
hagrid Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?
ron
hagrid Don't you, Norbert? Dededede.
hagrid Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.
harry Malfoy.
hagrid Oh, dear.
harry hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.
ron It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.
harry I don't understand. Is that bad?
ron It's bad.
mcgonagall Good evening.
mcgonagall Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.
harry 50?!
mcgonagall Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.
draco Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."the four of us."
mcgonagall No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.
filch A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. A sorry lot this, hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
hagrid Norbert's gone. dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
hermione Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.
hagrid Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.
filch Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.
draco The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. students aren't allowed. And there are......werewolves!
filch There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.
hagrid Right. Let's go.
harry hagrid, what's that?
hagrid What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. So, it's our job to find the poor beast. ron, hermione, you'll come with me.
ron Okay.
hagrid And harry, you'll go with Malfoy.
draco Okay. Then I get Fang!
hagrid Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.
draco You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.
harry If I didn't know better, draco, I'd say you were scared.
draco Scared, Potter?! Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.
harry What is it, Fang?
draco HELP!!!!!
firenze harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
harry But what was that thing you saved me from?
firenze A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
harry But who would choose such a life?
firenze Can you think of no one?
harry Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was voldemort?
firenze Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
harry The Philosopher's Stone.
hermione harry!
hagrid Hello there, firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, harry?
firenze harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.
hermione You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?
harry But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back.
ron But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
harry I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
ron And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!
hermione Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard voldemort always feared?
hermione I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.
ron Speak for yourself. all right there, harry?
harry My scar. It keeps burning.
hermione It's happened before.
harry Not like this.
ron Perhaps you should see the nurse.
harry I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!
hermione What is it?
harry Don't you think it's a bit odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? What did he look like?
hagrid I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.
harry The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.
hagrid Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, "After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."
harry And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
hagrid Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."
hagrid I shouldn't have told you that. Where you going?! Wait!
harry We have to see Professor dumbledore, immediately!
mcgonagall I'm afraid Professor dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.
harry He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.
mcgonagall How do you know
harry Someone's going to try and steal it.
mcgonagall I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.
harry That was no stranger hagrid met in the village. It was snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
hermione And with dumbledore gone
snape Good afternoon. Now, what would three young gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?
hermione Uh...we were just...
snape You want to be careful. People will think you're
hermione Now what do we do?
harry We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.
harry Trevor.
ron Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!
neville Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?
harry Now, neville, listen. We were
neville No! I won't let you!
hermione neville, I'm really, really sorry about this... Petrificus Totalus.
ron You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.
harry Let's go. Sorry.
hermione Sorry.
ron It's for your own good, you know.
hermione Ow! You stood on my foot!
ron Sorry.
hermione Alohomora.
ron Wait a minute...he's.... Sleeping.
harry snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp.
ron Uh. It's got horrible breath!
harry We have to move its paw.
ron What?!
harry Come on! If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?
hermione The harp. It stopped playing.
ron Ew! Yuck! Ugh.
harry Jump! Go!
ron Ahh! Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.
harry Whoa!
hermione Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
ron Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!
ron and harry hermione!!
ron Now what are we gonna do?!
hermione's voice Just relax!
harry hermione! Where are you?!
hermione Do what I say. Trust me.
ron Ahh! harry!
ron harry!
hermione Are you okay?
harry Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
ron Help!
hermione He's not relaxing, is he?
harry Apparently not.
ron Help! Help me!
hermione We've got to do something!
harry What?
hermione Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology.
ron Ahhh!
harry ron, are you okay?
ron Yeah.
harry Okay.
ron Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!
harry Lucky hermione pays attention in Herbology.
hermione What is that?
harry I don't know. Sounds like wings.
hermione Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
harry They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door.
hermione What's this all about?
harry I don't know. Strange.
ron Well, it was worth a try.
hermione Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!
ron We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.
harry There! I see it!
hermione What's wrong, harry?
harry It's too simple.
ron Oh, go on, harry! If snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!
ron This complicates things a bit!
harry Catch the key!
ron Hurry up!
hermione I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
harry Where are we? A graveyard.
ron This is no graveyard.
harry There's the door.
hermione Now what do we do?
ron It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. all right. harry, you take the Bishop's square. hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight.
hermione What happens now?
ron
hermione ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?
ron You there! D-5! Yes, hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!
ron Castle to E-4! Smash! ron Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! harry, ron and hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both ron and harry study the game.
harry Wait a minute.
ron You understand right, harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.
harry No, ron! No!
hermione What is it?
harry He's going to sacrifice himself!
hermione No, ron, you can't! There must be another way!
ron Knight...to H-3.
ron Check.
ron Ahhhh!
harry RON! Take care of ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to dumbledore. ron's right...I have to go on.
hermione You'll be okay, harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.
harry Not as good as you.
hermione Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And harry, just be careful.
harry You? No. It can't be...snape. He was the one
quirrell Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, "p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor quirrell?"
harry B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, snape tried to kill me.
quirrell No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with snape muttering his little counter-curse.
harry snape was trying to...save me?
quirrell I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
harry Th-then you let the troll in.
quirrell Very good Potter, yes. snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
quirrell Come here, Potter, now!
quirrell Tell me. What do you see?
quirrell What is it?! What do you see?!
harry I-I'm shaking hands with dumbledore. I've won the house cup.
voldemort's voice He lies.
quirrell Tell the truth! What do you see?!
voldemort's voice Let me speak to him.
quirrell Master, you are not strong enough.
voldemort's voice I have strength enough for this. harry Potter. We meet again.
harry voldemort.
voldemort Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!
voldemort Stop him! Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
harry Never!
voldemort Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back.
harry You liar!
voldemort Kill him!
quirrell Ahh! Ahh!
voldemort Fool! Get the stone!
quirrell Ahhhhhhhhhh!
voldemort Arrrhhhhhh!
harry Ahhhhhhhhh!
dumbledore Good afternoon, harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?
harry Admirers?
dumbledore What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. Ah, I see your friend ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate frogs.
harry ron was here? Is he all right? What about hermione?
dumbledore Fine. They're both just fine.
harry But, what happened to the Stone?
dumbledore Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
harry But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
dumbledore He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.
harry How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
dumbledore Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something.
harry Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that voldemort can never come back?
dumbledore Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. harry, do you know why Professor quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.
harry What is it?
dumbledore Love, harry, love. Mm. Alas. Earwax.
harry all right there, ron?
ron all right? You?
harry all right. hermione?
hermione Never better.
dumbledore Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.
students Whoo! Yeah!
draco Nice one, Mate!
dumbledore Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award.
harry Good job.
dumbledore Second, to Mr. ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess
hermione We're tied with Slytherin!
dumbledore And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to neville Longbottom.
dumbledore Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
hagrid Yes!
seamus neville!
lee Yeah! We won!!
hagrid Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.
hermione Come on, harry.
harry One minute.
hagrid Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? This is for you.
harry Thanks, hagrid.
hagrid Oh. Go on...on with you. Oh, listen, harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.
harry But hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
hagrid I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? Off you go.
hermione Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
harry I'm not going home. Not really.
