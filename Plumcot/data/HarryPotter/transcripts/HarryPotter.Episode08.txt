not_available It's beautiful here.
not_available It was our aunt's.
not_available We used to come here as kids.
not_available The Order uses it now as a safe house.
not_available What's left of us atleast.
not_available Muggles think these things keep evil away.
not_available But they're wrong.
not_available I need to talk to the Goblin.
not_available How are you?
not_available You buried the elf?
not_available Yes.
not_available And brought me here.
not_available You are...
not_available Pretty unusual, is it?
not_available How did you come by the sword?
not_available It's complicated.
not_available Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
not_available that it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
not_available It's complicated.
not_available The sword presented itself to us,
not_available in moment of need.
not_available We didn't steal it.
not_available There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault
not_available identical to this one.
not_available But it is a fake.
not_available It was placed there this past summer.
not_available And she never suspected it was a fake.
not_available The replica is very convincing.
not_available Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
not_available Who is the acquaintance?
not_available A Hogwarts Professor.
not_available As I understand that he's now Headmaster.
not_available Snape.
not_available He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.
not_available Why?
not_available There are more than a fewcurious things
not_available in the vaults at Gringotts.
not_available And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
not_available Perhaps.
not_available I need to get into Gringotts.
not_available Into one of the vaults.
not_available It is impossible.
not_available Alone, yes.
not_available But with you, no.
not_available Why should I help you?
not_available I have gold.
not_available Lots of...
not_available I've no interest in gold.
not_available Then what?
not_available That.
not_available That is my price.
not_available Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
not_available Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.
not_available She kept asking you,
not_available what else was taken?
not_available I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.
not_available Another piece of his soul.
not_available Let's find it, kill it, and we are
not_available one step closer to killing him.
not_available And what happens when we find it,
not_available How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?
not_available I'm still working on that part.
not_available He's weak.
not_available Who?
not_available Mr. Ollivander
not_available I need to ask you a few questions.
not_available Anything, m'boy.
not_available Anything!
not_available Would you mind identifying this wand?
not_available We need to know if it's safe to use.
not_available Uhh... Walnut
not_available Dragon Heartstring
not_available Unyie...
not_available Unyielding.
not_available This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.
not_available Treat it carefully.
not_available And this?
not_available Hawthorn.
not_available An unicorn hair.
not_available Reasonably pliant.
not_available This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
not_available Was?
not_available Is it not still?
not_available Well, perhaps not.
not_available If you won it from him.
not_available I sense its allegiance has changed.
not_available You talk about wands,
not_available as if they have feelings...
not_available ...can think!
not_available The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
not_available That much has always been clear to
not_available those of us who've studied wandlore.
not_available And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?
not_available It is rumored there are three.
not_available The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
not_available to hide you from your enemies...
not_available and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
not_available back loved ones from the dead.
not_available Together, they make one the Master of Death.
not_available But, few truly believe that such objects exist.
not_available Do you?
not_available Do you believe they exist, sir?
not_available Well...
not_available I see no reasons to put
not_available stock into an old wives' tale.
not_available You're lying!
not_available You know one exists.
not_available You told him about it.
not_available You told him about the Elder Wand...
not_available and where he could go looking for it.
not_available He tortured me.
not_available Besides...
not_available ...I only conveyed rumors.
not_available There's...
not_available There's no telling whether he will find it.
not_available He has found it, sir.
not_available We'll let you rest.
not_available He's after you, Mr. Potter.
not_available If it's true what you say,
not_available that he has the Elder Wand,
not_available I'm afraid,
not_available ...you really don't stand a chance.
not_available Well, I am supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.
not_available You're sure that's hers?
not_available Positive.
not_available Well?
not_available How do I look?
not_available Hideous.
not_available You can give that to Hermione to hold.
not_available Alright, Griphook?
not_available We're relying on you, Griphook.
not_available If you get us past the guards into the vault...
not_available The sword's yours.
not_available Madam Lestrange.
not_available Good morning.
not_available Good morning?
not_available Good morning?
not_available You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not_available not a school girl!
not_available Hey!
not_available Easy!
not_available If she gives us away, we must swear
not_available to use that sword to slit our own throats.
not_available Understand?
not_available No, he's right.
not_available I speak stupid.
not_available Okay.
not_available Let's do it.
not_available I wish to enter my vault.
not_available Identification?
not_available I hardly think that would be necessary.
not_available Madam Lestrange.
not_available I don't like to be kept waiting.
not_available I know...
not_available They know she's an impostor.
not_available They'd be warned.
not_available Harry...
not_available What do we do, Harry?
not_available Madam Lestrange,
not_available would you mind presenting your wand?
not_available And why should I do that?
not_available It's the bank's policy!
not_available I'm sure you understand, given current climate.
not_available No! I most certainly do not understand!
not_available I'm afraid, I must insist.
not_available Imperio!
not_available Very well, Madam Lestrange.
not_available If you would follow me?
not_available What is that, Griphook?
not_available Griphook!
not_available Aresto Momentum
not_available Well done, Hermione.
not_available Oh no, you two're like you again.
not_available The Thief's Downfall,
not_available washes away all enchantment.
not_available Can be deadly.
not_available You don't say.
not_available Just out of interest,
not_available is there any other way outta here?
not_available No.
not_available What the devil are all you doing down here?
not_available Thieves!
not_available You gave up the...
not_available Imperio
not_available You!
not_available That doesn't sound good.
not_available Bloody hell!
not_available It's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.
not_available Here.
not_available It's been trained to expect pain
not_available when it hears this noise.
not_available That's barbaric!
not_available Lumos.
not_available Blimey!
not_available Accio Horcrux!
not_available You seem you're gonna try
not_available this here, won't you?
not_available No kind of magic would work in here.
not_available It's in here, Harry?
not_available Can you feel anything?
not_available That's it!
not_available Up there!
not_available They have added the Gemino curse.
not_available Everything you touch will multiply.
not_available Give me the sword.
not_available Stop moving!
not_available Do it!
not_available We had deal, Griphook!
not_available The cup for the sword!
not_available I said I'll get you in,
not_available I didn't say anything about getting you out.
not_available Griphook! Thieves!
not_available Griphook!
not_available Hey, thieves!
not_available Is that okay?
not_available We've still got Bogrod.
not_available That's unfortunate.
not_available We can't just stand here,
not_available You got any idea?
not_available Should be a brilliant one.
not_available I've got something,
not_available but it's mad!
not_available Reducto
not_available Well, come on, then!
not_available Relashio
not_available Keep moving!
not_available Now what?
not_available Reducto
not_available Hold on.
not_available That was brilliant!
not_available Absolutely brilliant!
not_available We're dropping!
not_available I say we jump!
not_available When?
not_available Now!
not_available He knows.
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who.
not_available He knows we broke into Gringotts.
not_available He knows what we took,
not_available and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.
not_available How did he know?
not_available I saw him.
not_available You let him in?
not_available Harry, you can't do that!
not_available Hermione, I can't always help it!
not_available Well, maybe I can.
not_available I don't know!
not_available Never mind!
not_available What happened?
not_available Well, he's angry...
not_available and scared too.
not_available He knows, if we find and destroy
not_available all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.
not_available I reckon he'll stop at nothing
not_available to make sure we don't find the rest.
not_available And there's more.
not_available One of them is at Hogwarts.
not_available What?
not_available You saw it?
not_available I saw the castle.
not_available And Rowena Ravenclaw.
not_available It must have something to do with her.
not_available We have to go there, now!
not_available Well, we can't do that!
not_available We've got to plan,
not_available we've got to figure it out!
not_available Hermione, when have any of
not_available our plans ever actually worked?
not_available We plan, we get there,
not_available all hell breaks loose.
not_available He's right!
not_available One problem...
not_available Snape's Headmaster now,
not_available we can't just move freely from the front door!
not_available Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
not_available to Honeydukes.
not_available Take the secret passage in the cellar.
not_available It's...
not_available There's something wrong with him.
not_available It's like, you know,
not_available in the past...
not_available I've always been able
not_available to follow his thoughts.
not_available And now everything just feels disconnected.
not_available Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
not_available Maybe he's getting weaker.
not_available Maybe he's dying!
not_available No!
not_available No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded.
not_available If anything, he feels more dangerous.
not_available Right here. Come on!
not_available Search everywhere.
not_available Go, move!
not_available Faster!
not_available In here, Potter.
not_available Come on, move!
not_available Did you look at him.
not_available For a second I thought that was...
not_available I know. Dumbledore!
not_available Harry?
not_available I can see you in this.
not_available Bloody fools, what are you thinking coming here?
not_available Have you any idea how dangerous it is?
not_available You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.
not_available It's you who I've been seeing in here.
not_available You're the one who sent Dobby.
not_available Why've you left him?
not_available He's dead.
not_available Sorry to hear it.
not_available I liked that elf.
not_available Who gave that to you?
not_available The mirror?
not_available Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.
not_available Dung had no right selling that to you.
not_available It belongs to...
not_available Sirius...
not_available Albus told me.
not_available He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,
not_available ...if you ever found that I had it.
not_available But, ask yourself;
not_available Where would you be if I didn't?
not_available Do you have any others much?
not_available From the Order?
not_available The Order has finished.
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who has won,
not_available ...anyone who says otherwise
not_available is killing themselves.
not_available We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.
not_available Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
not_available Did he now...
not_available Nice job?
not_available Easy?
not_available We've been hunting Horcruxes.
not_available We think the last one's inside the castle.
not_available But we'll need your help getting in.
not_available Which job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.
not_available Do yourself a favor, boy.
not_available Go home!
not_available Live a little longer.
not_available Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
not_available What makes you think you can trust him?
not_available What makes you think you can
not_available believe anything my brother told you?
not_available And in all the time you knew him...
not_available Did he ever mention my name?
not_available Did he ever mentioned hers?
not_available Why should he...
not_available Keep secrets.
not_available You tell me?
not_available I trusted him.
not_available That's the boy's answer.
not_available A boy goes chasing Horcruxes is on the word of
not_available a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.
not_available You're lying!
not_available Not just on me, it doesn't matter.
not_available To yourself as well.
not_available That's what a fool does.
not_available You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!
not_available So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.
not_available I'm not interested in what happened
not_available between you and your brother.
not_available I don't care that you've given up.
not_available I trusted the man I knew.
not_available We need to get into the castle tonight.
not_available You know what to do.
not_available Where have you sent her?
not_available You'll see.
not_available Soon enough.
not_available That's your sister, Ariana.
not_available Isn't it?
not_available She died very young, didn't she?
not_available My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.
not_available On his journey to find power.
not_available Including Ariana.
not_available And she was devoted to him.
not_available He gave her everything.
not_available But time.
not_available Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.
not_available He did save our lives twice!
not_available Kept an eye on us on that mirror.
not_available That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!
not_available She's coming back.
not_available What's that with her?
not_available Neville!
not_available How you look...
not_available Like hell, I reckon.
not_available But this is nothing.
not_available Seamus is worse.
not_available Hey, Ab!
not_available We've got a couple more coming through.
not_available Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.
not_available That's because it never existed till now.
not_available The seven secret passages were sealed off,
not_available before the start of the year.
not_available This is the only way in or out, now.
not_available The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.
not_available How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?
not_available Hardly ever seen.
not_available It's the Carrows who's watching out for.
not_available Carrows?
not_available Yeah. Brother and sister.
not_available Incharge of discipline.
not_available They like punishment, the Carrows.
not_available They did that to you?
not_available Why?
not_available Today's Dark Arts lesson was
not_available practicing the Cruciatus curse.
not_available On first years.
not_available I refused.
not_available Hogwarts has changed.
not_available Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?
not_available Hey, you lots! It's
not_available for your surprise.
not_available No more about Aberforth's cook's gonna help.
not_available We'll be surprised if it's just digested.
not_available Oh my!
not_available Harry!
not_available Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.
not_available Okay, okay!
not_available Let's not kill him before YouKnow
not_available Who does.
not_available ...Do you read? we've a new weather report.
not_available Lightning has struck. I 
repeat Lightning has struck.
not_available What's the fun, Harry?
not_available Okay.
not_available There's something we need to find.
not_available There's something hidden here, in the castle.
not_available And it may help us to defeat
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who.
not_available Alright, what is it?
not_available We don't know.
not_available Where is it?
not_available We don't know that either.
not_available I realize that's not much to go on.
not_available That's nothing to go on.
not_available I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.
not_available It'll be small, easily concealed.
not_available Anyone, any ideas?
not_available Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.
not_available Oh, bloody hell!
not_available Here we go!
not_available Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
not_available Hasn't anyone heard of it?
not_available It's quite famous.
not_available Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.
not_available For centuries.
not_available There's no person alive today who's seen it.
not_available Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?
not_available It's a sort of crown.
not_available You know, like a tiara.
not_available Harry!
not_available Hi, there.
not_available Six months she hasn't seen me and
not_available it's like I'm a frankie first
not_available year.
not_available I'm her brother!
not_available She got lots of them, but she has got only one Harry.
not_available Shut up, Seamus!
not_available What is it, Ginny?
not_available Snape knows... he knows
not_available that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
not_available Many of you are surely wondering,
not_available why I have summoned you at this hour.
not_available It's come to my attention,
not_available that earlier this evening...
not_available Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
not_available Now...
not_available should anyone...
not_available student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?
not_available They will be punished in a manner consistent with
not_available the severity of their transcription, further more...
not_available Any person found have
not_available knowledge of these events...
not_available who fails to come forward...
not_available will be treated as equally guilty.
not_available Another...
not_available If anyone in here has any knowledge of
not_available Mr. Potter's movements this evening.
not_available I invite them to step forward.
not_available Now!
not_available It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,
not_available ...you still have a security problem, Headmaster.
not_available I'm afraid it's quite extensive.
not_available How dare you stand where he stood?
not_available Tell them how it happened that night?
not_available Tell them how you looked him in the eye...
not_available A man who trusted you, and killed him.
not_available Tell them!
not_available COWARD!
not_available Harry.
not_available Potter?
not_available I know that many of you will want to fight.
not_available Some of you might even think to fight is wise.
not_available But this is folly.
not_available Give me Harry Potter.
not_available Do this and none shall be harmed.
not_available Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.
not_available Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded.
not_available You have one hour.
not_available What're you waiting for?
not_available Someone grab him!
not_available Students out of bed!
not_available Students in the corridor!
not_available They're supposed to be out of bed,
not_available you blithering idiot!
not_available Sorry ma'am.
not_available As it happens, Mr. Filch...
not_available Your arrival is most opportune.
not_available If you would, I wouldd like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson
not_available and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.
not_available Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?
not_available The dungeons would do.
not_available I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.
not_available What is it you need?
not_available Time, Professor.
not_available As much as you can get me.
not_available Do what you have to do.
not_available I'll secure the castle.
not_available Potter...
not_available It's good to see you.
not_available It's good to see you too, Professor.
not_available Hold the fort, Neville.
not_available Harry!
not_available Hermione and I were thinking,
not_available it doesn't matter if we find the Horcrux.
not_available What do you mean?
not_available Unless we can destroy it.
not_available So, we were thinking...
not_available Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.
not_available It was completely brilliant
not_available You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
not_available with a Basilisk fang, right?
not_available Well, me and Hermione did remind
not_available where we might find one.
not_available Okay.
not_available Okay, but take this.
not_available That way, you can find me when you get back.
not_available Where're you going?
not_available Ravenclaw common room,
not_available Gotta start somewhere.
not_available Harry!
not_available Harry!
not_available Let me get this straight, Professor...
not_available You're actually giving us
not_available permission to do this?
not_available That is correct, Longbottom.
not_available That's blowing up!
not_available Boom!
not_available Boom!
not_available Wicked!
not_available But how on earth are we gonna do that?
not_available Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?
not_available As I recall, he has a particular
not_available proclivity for pyro
not_available technics.
not_available I can bring it down.
not_available That's the spirit!
not_available Well, you go.
not_available You do realize, of course, we can't
not_available keep out YouKnow
not_available Who indefinitely.
not_available That doesn't mean
not_available we can't delay him.
not_available And his name is Voldemort.
not_available Filius, you might as well use it.
not_available He's come to try to kill you, either way!
not_available Piertotum Locomotor.
not_available Hogwarts is threatened.
not_available Man the boundaries! Protect us.
not_available Do your duty...
not_available ...to our school.
not_available I always wanted to use that spell!
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Fianto Duri
not_available Repello Inimigotum
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Fianto Duri
not_available Repello...
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Fianto Duri
not_available Repello Inimigotum
not_available Protego Maxima
not_available Harry, wait!
not_available I need to talk to you!
not_available I'm a bit pre
not_available occupied at the moment, Luna.
not_available You don't know where you're going.
not_available You're wasting your time!
not_available Look, we'll talk later, okay?
not_available Harry?
not_available Later.
not_available Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!
not_available Do you remember what Cho said
not_available about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?
not_available There is not a person alive who's seen it.
not_available It's obvious, isn't it?
not_available We have to talk to someone who's dead.
not_available It's very impressive, isn't it?
not_available If you want to find her,
not_available you'll find her down there.
not_available Aren't you coming?
not_available No.
not_available I think it's best if you two talk alone.
not_available She's very shy.
not_available You're the Grey Lady.
not_available The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.
not_available I do not answer to that name!
not_available No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
not_available It's Helena, isn't it?
not_available Helena Ravenclaw,
not_available Rowena's daughter.
not_available Are you a friend of Luna's?
not_available Yes.
not_available And she thought you might be able to help me.
not_available You seek my mother's diadem?
not_available Yes.
not_available That's right.
not_available Luna is kind.
not_available Unlike so many of the others.
not_available But she was wrong,
not_available I cannot help you!
not_available Wait, please!
not_available I want to destroy it!
not_available They never learn.
not_available Such a pity.
not_available My Lord...
not_available Shouldn't we wait?
not_available Begin!
not_available I thought you want to do it.
not_available Isn't it, Helena?
not_available You want it destroyed?
not_available Another promised
not_available to destroy it many years ago.
not_available A strange boy with a strange name?
not_available Tom Riddle.
not_available But he lied.
not_available He lied to many people.
not_available I know what he's done!
not_available I know who he is!
not_available He defiled it, with dark magic!
not_available I can destroy it.
not_available Once and for all.
not_available But only if you tell me
not_available where he hid it?
not_available You do know where he hid it?
not_available Don't you, Helena?
not_available You just have to tell me.
not_available Please!
not_available Strange!
not_available You remind me of him a bit.
not_available It's here, in the castle.
not_available In the place where everything is hidden.
not_available If you have to ask...
not_available ...you will never know.
not_available If you know...
not_available ...you need only ask.
not_available Thank you!
not_available Tell Professor McGonagall.
not_available Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
not_available Yes, sir!
not_available Hey Dean, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we
not_available might need one or two more wands this side.
not_available It is the quality of one's convictions that determines one's success..
not_available ...not the number of followers.
not_available Who said that?
not_available Me.
not_available You okay, Freddie?
not_available Yeah.
not_available Me too.
not_available Harry talks this in sleep.
not_available You know it?
not_available No, of course, not!
not_available Yeah?
not_available YouKnow
not_available Who's army?
not_available You do it.
not_available I can't.
not_available Yes, you can!
not_available Neville!
not_available That went well.
not_available Get inside!
not_available Stupefy
not_available Ginny, Neville!
not_available You alright?
not_available Never better!
not_available I feel like I can spit fire!
not_available Have you seen Luna up there?
not_available Luna?
not_available I'm mad for her. I think it�s about time I told her
not_available since we�ll probably both be dead by dawn.
not_available I know.
not_available Bloody hell!
not_available We'll never find him on this.
not_available Here he is!
not_available He's just...
not_available Brilliant!
not_available He just vanished.
not_available I'm sure I saw it.
not_available Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.
not_available It doesn't show up on the map, does it?
not_available You said that last year.
not_available That's right, I did.
not_available Let's go.
not_available Brilliant!
not_available Come on!
not_available Well, well...
not_available What brings you here, Potter?
not_available I could ask you the same.
not_available You have something that's mine.
not_available I'd like it back.
not_available What's wrong with the wand you have?
not_available It's my mother's.
not_available It's powerful, but it's...
not_available ..not the same.
not_available Doesn't quite understand me.
not_available You know what I mean?
not_available Why didn't you tell her?
not_available Bellatrix?
not_available You knew it was me.
not_available You didn't say anything.
not_available Come on, Draco!
not_available Don't be a prat.
not_available Do it!
not_available Easy!
not_available Expelliarmus
not_available Avada Kedavra
not_available Stupefy
not_available This is my girlfriend,
not_available you bloody gits!
not_available Got it!
not_available They've set the bloody place on fire!
not_available Come on!
not_available This way!
not_available We can't leave them!
not_available He's joking, right?
not_available If we die for them,
not_available Harry, I'm gonna kill you!
not_available Harry!
not_available My Lord?
not_available Avada Kedavra!
not_available Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.
not_available It's the snake.
not_available She's the last one.
not_available It's the last Horcrux.
not_available Look inside him, Harry.
not_available Find out where he is,
not_available if you find him, we can find the snake.
not_available And we can end this!
not_available My Lord...
not_available Might it be less...
not_available I should not be more prudent to call off this attack.
not_available Simply seek the boy.
not_available Yourself.
not_available I do not need to seek the boy...
not_available ...before the night is out, he will come to me!
not_available Do you understand?
not_available Look at me!
not_available How can you live with yourself, Lucius?
not_available I don't know.
not_available Go and find Severus.
not_available Bring him to me.
not_available I know where he is.
not_available Come on!
not_available No!
not_available You have performed extra
not_available ordinary magic
not_available with this wand, My Lord,
not_available in the last few hours alone.
not_available No!
not_available No! I am extra
not_available ordinary.
not_available But the wand resists me .
not_available There is no wand more powerful.
not_available Ollivander himself has said it.
not_available Tonight, when the boy comes.
not_available It will not fail you, I am sure ...
not_available It answers to you,
not_available and you only.
not_available Does it?
not_available My Lord?
not_available The wand, does it truly
not_available answer to me?
not_available You're a clever man, Severus.
not_available Surely you must know...
not_available Where does its true loyalty lie?
not_available With you...
not_available Of course, My Lord.
not_available The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,
not_available because I am not its true master.
not_available The Elder Wand belongs to the
not_available wizard who killed its last owner.
not_available You killed Dumbledore, Severus.
not_available While you live, the Elder
not_available Wand cannot truly be mine.
not_available You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
not_available But only I can live forever.
not_available My Lord...
not_available Nagini, kill!
not_available Take it...
not_available Take it up, please!
not_available Give me something!
not_available Quickly, a flask. Anything!
not_available Take them to the Pensieve.
not_available Look at me...
not_available You really have your mother's eyes.
not_available You've fought valiantly,
not_available but in vain...
not_available I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood
not_available spilled is a terrible waste.
not_available I therefore command my forces to retreat...
not_available In their absence,
not_available dispose your dead with dignity,
not_available Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.
not_available On this night, you have allowed your friends to die
not_available for you, rather than face me yourself.
not_available There is no greater dishonor.
not_available Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...
not_available ...and confront your fate.
not_available If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
not_available woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.
not_available Where's everybody?
not_available Harry?
not_available Oh, come on!
not_available Don't be sad on it, she's passed.
not_available There, she's gone.
not_available Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
not_available You're freak!
not_available You're freak, Lily!
not_available Come here!
not_available She's jealous.
not_available She's ordinary and you're special.
not_available That's not true, Severus.
not_available Gryffindor!
not_available Hi, I'm James.
not_available Hi, I'm Lily.
not_available Just like your father.
not_available Don't say a word against my father!
not_available Masters shall be reunited once more!
not_available Severus.
not_available Don't kill me!
not_available The prophecy did not refer to a woman.
not_available It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.
not_available Yes, but it's her son!
not_available He intends to hunt them down and kill them.
not_available Hide him... hide them all.
not_available I beg you!
not_available What would you give me in exchange, Severus?
not_available Anything.
not_available Harry...
not_available Harry, you were so loved.
not_available So loved!
not_available Harry, mama loves you.
not_available Dadda loves you.
not_available Harry, be safe.
not_available Be strong.
not_available Avada Kedavra!
not_available You said you would keep her safe.
not_available Lily and James...
not_available put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.
not_available Rather like you.
not_available The boy survives.
not_available He doesn't need protection,
not_available the Dark Lord has gone.
not_available The Dark Lord will return.
not_available And when he does, the boy
not_available will be in terrible danger!
not_available He has her eyes.
not_available If you truly loved her...
not_available No one, can know.
not_available I shall never reveal the best of you,
not_available Severus.
not_available Your word?
not_available Can you risk your life every day
not_available to protect the boy?
not_available ... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father's and he seems to relish in his fame...
not_available Don't tell a word against my father!
not_available James Potter, lazy, arrogant.
not_available My father was a great man!
not_available Your father was a swine!
not_available Drink it, it will contain the curse to
not_available your hand, for the time being.
not_available It will spread, Albus.
not_available How long?
not_available Maybe a year.
not_available Don't ignore me, Severus.
not_available We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered
not_available the Malfoy boy to murder me.
not_available But should he fail, I should presume
not_available the Dark Lord will turn to you.
not_available You must be the one to kill me, Severus.
not_available It is the only way.
not_available Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.
not_available There will come a time, when Harry Potter,
not_available must be told something.
not_available But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
not_available Must be told what?
not_available On the night Lord Voldemort went
not_available to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...
not_available Then, Lily Potter cast herself between them...
not_available ...the curse rebounded.
not_available When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul...
not_available latched itself onto the only living thing it could find...
not_available Harry himself.
not_available There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...
not_available There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind...
not_available A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
not_available So, when the time comes...
not_available ...the boy must die?
not_available Yes... yes.
not_available He must die.
not_available You've kept him alive, so he can
not_available die at the proper moment?
not_available You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
not_available Don't tell me now, that you've
not_available grown to care for the boy.
not_available Expecto Patronum
not_available Lily!
not_available After all this time!
not_available Always.
not_available So, when the time comes...
not_available ...the boy must die?
not_available Yes.
not_available He must die.
not_available And Voldemort himself must do it.
not_available That is essential.
not_available Where've you been?
not_available I thought you went to the forest.
not_available I'm going there now.
not_available Are you mad?
not_available No...
not_available You can't give yourself up to him.
not_available What is it, Harry?
not_available What is it you know?
not_available There is a reason I can hear them.
not_available The Horcruxes.
not_available I think I've known for a while.
not_available And I think you have, too.
not_available I'll go with you.
not_available No, kill the snake.
not_available Kill the snake, and it's just him!
not_available I'm ready to die.
not_available Resurrection Stone.
not_available You've been so brave, sweetheart.
not_available Why are you here?
not_available All of you.
not_available We never left.
not_available Does...
not_available Does it hurt?
not_available Dying?
not_available Quicker than falling asleep.
not_available You're nearly there, son.
not_available I'm sorry.
not_available I never wanted any of you to die for me.
not_available And, Remus, your son?
not_available Others will tell him what his
not_available mother and father died for.
not_available One day, he'll understand.
not_available You'll stay with me?
not_available Until the end.
not_available And he won't be able to see you?
not_available No.
not_available We're here, you see.
not_available Stay close to me.
not_available Always.
not_available No sign of him, My Lord.
not_available I thought he'd come.
not_available Harry, no!
not_available What're yeh doin' 'ere?
not_available Quiet!
not_available Harry Potter...
not_available ...The Boy Who Lived...
not_available ...come to die.
not_available Avada Kedavra
not_available You can't help...
not_available Harry, you're a wonderful boy...
not_available You brave, brave man!
not_available Let us walk.
not_available Professor, what is that?
not_available Something beyond either of our help.
not_available A part of Voldemort sent here to die.
not_available And exactly where are we?
not_available I was gonna ask you that.
not_available Where would you say where we are?
not_available Well, it looks like King's Cross station.
not_available Only cleaner...
not_available ...and without all the trains.
not_available King's Cross, is that right?
not_available This is as they say, 'your' party.
not_available I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...
not_available ...have been connected by something other than fate.
not_available Since that night at Godric's Hollow all those years ago.
not_available So it's true then, sir.
not_available A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?
not_available Did.
not_available It's been just destroyed many moments
not_available ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
not_available You, were the Horcrux he
not_available never meant to make, Harry.
not_available I have to go back, haven't I?
not_available Oh, that's up to you.
not_available I've a choice?
not_available Oh, yeah!
not_available We're in King's Cross, you say.
not_available I think if so decide,
not_available you'll be able to board a train.
not_available And where will it take me?
not_available On.
not_available Voldemort has the Elder Wand?
not_available True.
not_available And the snake is still alive?
not_available Yes.
not_available And I've nothing to kill it with?
not_available Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.
not_available To those who ask for it.
not_available I've always pride of myself
not_available on my ability to turn a phrase.
not_available Words are, in my not so humble opinion...
not_available ..almost inexhaustible source of magic.
not_available Capable of inflicting
not_available injury and remedies.
not_available But I would in this case...
not_available amend my original statement to this:
not_available Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,
not_available To those who deserve it.
not_available Do not pity the dead, Harry...
not_available Pity the living.
not_available And above all...
not_available ...all those who live without love.
not_available Professor, my mother's Patronus...
not_available was a doe, wasn't it?
not_available As the same as Professor Snape's.
not_available It's curious, don't you think?
not_available Actually, if I think about it...
not_available ...it doesn't seem curious at all!
not_available I'll be going now, Harry.
not_available Professor?
not_available Is this all real?
not_available Or is it just happening inside my head?
not_available Of course it's happening
not_available inside your head, Harry.
not_available Why should that mean, that it's not real?
not_available Professor?
not_available What should I do?
not_available Professor!
not_available My Lord, My Lord...
not_available Are you hurt?
not_available I don't need your help.
not_available The boy...
not_available Is he dead?
not_available Is he alive?
not_available Draco, is he alive?
not_available Dead.
not_available Who is that?
not_available Hagrid's carrying?
not_available Neville, who is it?
not_available Harry Potter...
not_available ... is dead!
not_available No!
not_available No!
not_available Silence!
not_available Stupid girl!
not_available Harry Potter...
not_available is dead!
not_available From this day forth...
not_available ...you'll put your faith in me.
not_available Harry Potter is dead!
not_available And now it's the time to declare yourself.
not_available Come forward and join us...
not_available or die!
not_available Draco!
not_available Draco.
not_available Draco.
not_available Come.
not_available Well done, Draco.
not_available Well done!
not_available Well, I must say I'd hope for better.
not_available And who might you be, young man?
not_available Neville Longbottom.
not_available Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
not_available find a place for you in our rank.
not_available I'd like to say something.
not_available Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
not_available fascinated to hear what you have to say.
not_available Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
not_available Stand down, Neville!
not_available People die everyday!
not_available Friends, family.
not_available Yeah...
not_available We lost Harry tonight.
not_available He's still with us.
not_available In here.
not_available So as Fred, Remus...
not_available Tonks...
not_available All of them.
not_available They didn't die in vain.
not_available But you will.
not_available Because you're wrong!
not_available Harry's heart did beat for us.
not_available For all of us!
not_available It's not over!
not_available Confringo
not_available Come on!
not_available All remain into the castle.
not_available We have to kill the snake.
not_available Hey, Neville!
not_available Not my daughter, you bitch!
not_available Hey, you were right...
not_available ...when you told Professor Snape
not_available that wand was failing you.
not_available It was always fail...
not_available I killed Snape!
not_available Yeah, but what if the wand never belonged to Snape?
not_available What if its allegiance has always been
not_available with someone else?
not_available Oh, come on, Tom...
not_available Let's finish it the way we started.
not_available Together!
not_available Die!
not_available Harry!
not_available Why didn't it work for him?
not_available The Elder Wand?
not_available It answers to somebody else.
not_available When he killed Snape, he thought
not_available the wand would become his.
not_available But the thing is...
not_available The wand never belongs to Snape.
not_available It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
not_available that night in the Astronomy tower.
not_available From that moment on, the wand answered him.
not_available Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.
not_available At Malfoy Manor.
not_available So, that means...
not_available It's mine!
not_available What should we do with it?
not_available We?
not_available Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.
not_available The most powerful wand in the world.
not_available With that, he'll be invincible.
not_available Together.
not_available Bag?
not_available Yeah
not_available Jumper?
not_available I'm gonna miss you.
not_available Here they come.last lines; 19 years later Harry and Ginny now married take their children to Platform Nine and ThreeQuarters to board Hogwarts Express
not_available Dad, what if I am put in Slytherin?
not_available Albus Severus Potter, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was the bravest man I’d ever known.
not_available But just say that I am.
not_available Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful young wizard. But listen, if it really means that much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
not_available Really?
not_available Really.
not_available Ready?
not_available Ready.
