#unknown He didn't even tell me he was coming.
#unknown A man was killed?  A Federale, right in front of him.
#unknown Three agents wounded, one lost his leg.
#unknown It's like what you hear about from Iraq or something.
#unknown The IEDs.
#unknown Oh, Jesus.
#unknown I had to hear about it from Steve Gomez.
#unknown Hank talked to his ASAC for about an hour.
#unknown Hank could win an Oscar.
#unknown He's so damn breezy with the man.
#unknown He hangs up the phone, goes right back to bed.
#unknown And all he keeps saying is, "I'm fine.
#unknown I'm fine.

#unknown Better not get too close.
#unknown Well, I'll take my chances.
#unknown I guess you heard about what happened down in JuÃ¡rez? Terrible.
#unknown What do you expect? Bunch of freaking animals.
#unknown It's like Apocalypse Now down there.
#unknown It's like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
#unknown And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
#unknown Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh? You know, you don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards you send him home.
#unknown You know? I was, you know "He's out getting an evidence bag and so ends up without a scratch on him.
#unknown So must be something wrong with that picture, you know.
#unknown " So are you home for good then? No, no.
#unknown It's Playing it by ear.
#unknown To be determined.
#unknown Think you might wanna talk it through with somebody? What, a shrink? No, no, no.
#unknown Can't go down that road.
#unknown Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye.
#unknown Or Marie.
#unknown Or me, if you like.
#unknown You know, I don't know how to say this.
#unknown I You know, the things I deal with you and me don't have much of a What you might call "an experiential overlap.
#unknown " What if I told you we do? I have spent my whole life scared.
#unknown Frightened of things that could happen might happen, might not happen.
#unknown Fifty years I spent like that.
#unknown Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
#unknown But you know what? Ever since my diagnosis I sleep just fine.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown And I came to realize it's that fear that's the worst of it.
#unknown That's the real enemy.
#unknown So Get up.
#unknown Get out in the real world.
#unknown And you kick that bastard as hard as you can right in the teeth.
#unknown Do it again.
#unknown Go on.
#unknown Ten thousand even, same as last time.
#unknown It's totally accurate.
#unknown You and I, we are gonna feed this machine.
#unknown I want it running 24 hours a day.
#unknown Right on.
#unknown Not yours, I take it.
#unknown We got 10, 20, 30 44, five each.
#unknown Three pounds should be 48 each.
#unknown Who's short? All right.
#unknown Don't freak, all right? We didn't get ripped off.
#unknown But Badger hasn't kicked in his full amount.
#unknown I know he was planning on pulling an allnighter so he's probably still in the sack.
#unknown Then wake him up.
#unknown He can sleep after we're paid.
#unknown Why you gotta be such a hardon? You're not his pal.
#unknown You're his boss.
#unknown This only works when they're scared of you, remember? Jackoff.
#unknown It's going straight to voicemail.
#unknown Voicemail? Just chill, okay? Count your money.
#unknown Combo.
#unknown Yo, what's up? You seen Badger? Don't you cover for him, bitch.
#unknown I ask you a straightup question, I expect a straightup answer.
#unknown Well? They were too scared to tell me.
#unknown Badger got busted.
#unknown He's in jail.
#unknown Honey, I'm home! Too slow! What's up? Got more lives than a damn cat.

#unknown Sure enough, last night.
#unknown Got themselves an honesttoGod dealer.
#unknown I was thinking of cruising over and saying hello.
#unknown Maybe you'd like to go with me? Yeah.
#unknown Well, all right.
#unknown You told me to my face you weren't a cop, man.
#unknown I feel manipulated.
#unknown I thought we were gonna hang out.
#unknown We are hanging out, Badger.
#unknown You like Badger or Brandon? I like people who don't, like, abuse the Constitution.
#unknown Badger, listen.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I'm trying to help you here, man.
#unknown Now, if you just tell me who your supplier is I think this can end very well for you.
#unknown What are you doing, detective, talking to my client without me present? You sneaky Pete.
#unknown Which is which? What, did the academy hire you right out of the womb? You guys get younger every What'd you say to baby face? Did you say anything stupid? By "anything stupid," I mean anything at all.

#unknown Brandon Mayhew.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Brandon Mayhew.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown Public masturbation.
#unknown What? I don't get it.
#unknown What's the kick? Why don't you do it at home with a big flatscreen TV, In a Starbucks.
#unknown That's nice.
#unknown That ain't me, man.
#unknown I I was the guy who was selling meth.
#unknown Allegedly.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I got you.
#unknown Meth.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Sorry, that was a little transpositional error.
#unknown Nothing a little WiteOut can't take care of.
#unknown Yeah, and felony quantity.
#unknown Just barely.
#unknown Yeah, just barely.
#unknown The cops are like butchers.
#unknown Always got their thumbs on the scales.
#unknown But good luck arguing that in court.
#unknown Let me get down to brass tacks.
#unknown I'm gonna get you a second phone call.
#unknown You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader and they're gonna deliver me a check for $4650.
#unknown I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card.
#unknown Foursixfivezero.
#unknown Okay? And I need that in a cashier's check or a money order, doesn't matter.
#unknown Actually, I want it in a money order.
#unknown And make it out to "Ice Station Zebra Associates.
#unknown " That's my loanout.
#unknown It's totally legit.
#unknown It's done just for tax purposes.
#unknown And after that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask.
#unknown All right? Any questions? You're gonna get me off, right? What do I look like, your highschool girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting? That's a joke, Brandon.
#unknown Lighten up.
#unknown Son, I promise you this.
#unknown I will give you the best criminal defense that money can buy.
#unknown Yeah, but, Francesca, I took these already.
#unknown Didn't I take these already? It's on your head.
#unknown You're not supposed to double up on vitamin A.
#unknown It's bad for the liver.
#unknown Okay, who's next? Did him.
#unknown I did him.
#unknown That one went public defender.
#unknown Thanks for nothing.
#unknown What happened to my masturbator? You got me all turned around.
#unknown Hang on.
#unknown I'll get back to you.
#unknown I sense you're discussing my client.
#unknown Anything you care to share with me? Sure.
#unknown Your commercials? They suck ass.
#unknown I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
#unknown Is that like the one your mom works at? Is she still offering the twoforone discount? DEA, huh? For a street bust.
#unknown Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp? Sooner or later, this was gonna happen.
#unknown You want your exponential growth guys are gonna get busted.
#unknown Simple as that.
#unknown How about we get him a real attorney? What the hell is this? This is who he hires? What? Are you kidding me? This is the guy you want.
#unknown This is the guy I'd hire.
#unknown It's the guy you'd hire.
#unknown Look, you remember Emilio? Okay, this dude got Emilio off, like, twice.
#unknown Okay? Both times, they had him dead to rights, yo.
#unknown And then, poof.
#unknown Dude is like Houdini.
#unknown Seriously, when the going gets tough you don't want a criminal lawyer.
#unknown You want a "criminal" lawyer.
#unknown Know what I'm saying? Look, we're in good shape, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Badger is way too loyal to roll.
#unknown Plus, he's scared shitless of me, all right.
#unknown We pay four large.
#unknown Cost of business.
#unknown Take it out of his payroll.
#unknown And it's only his first dealing rap so, worstcase scenario, you know, they plead him out.
#unknown He does five months picking up litter in an orange jump suit.
#unknown So who goes inside? I don't need them seeing my face.
#unknown Well, I don't need them seeing my face.
#unknown Why not? You look like his typical clientele.
#unknown Dick.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.
#unknown Heads.
#unknown Mayhew? Mr.
#unknown Mayhew? Mr.
#unknown Mayhew.
#unknown Nice of you to come down.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Look at you.
#unknown Should I call the FBI and tell them I found D.
#unknown B.
#unknown Cooper? Joking.
#unknown I Please, come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown Saul Goodman.
#unknown Please sit.
#unknown So it's a shame that we have to meet under these circumstances.
#unknown I believe you have something for me? Oh, yes.
#unknown Mayhew.
#unknown Is that Irish or English?  Irish.
#unknown Faith and begorra.
#unknown A fellow potatoeater.
#unknown My real name is McGill.
#unknown The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.
#unknown They all want a pipehitting member of the tribe, so to speak.
#unknown I digress.
#unknown Good things are happening.
#unknown Fact is, your nephew is gonna get out in no time.
#unknown That's wonderful, yeah.
#unknown There's still a few details to be ironed out but now that the DEA is involved I think he's looking at time served, then probation.
#unknown So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch.
#unknown Excuse me, the DEA?  Yeah.
#unknown That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
#unknown The feds.
#unknown I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers.
#unknown I understand that.
#unknown What does that have to do with the DEA? They're after some mystery man some heavyhitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.
#unknown They want this guy like the axe wants the turkey.
#unknown Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
#unknown Jesus, cheer up.
#unknown This is good news.
#unknown I mean, Brandon fell headfirst into the doodoo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne.
#unknown Wait, wait.
#unknown Look, I just I think I just think that we should review our options.
#unknown Options? I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
#unknown You got a grand total of two.
#unknown Option A: Brandon takes the deal.
#unknown Option B: Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big.
#unknown Look, look.
#unknown What about reprisals? I mean, if Badger If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg I mean, what if, God forbid that they decide to take revenge? What have you been telling him? The kid keeps spouting off about, "if I talk, they'll kill me.
#unknown " Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal.
#unknown Good.
#unknown No, that's not good.
#unknown That's terrible.
#unknown Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks.
#unknown You let him take his chances on the outside.
#unknown Maybe I can work in some witness protection.
#unknown No, look, look.
#unknown These are vicious, desperate people.
#unknown I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
#unknown People love to take credit for the fun ones.
#unknown The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
#unknown His wife killed him, all right? It was open and shut.
#unknown Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay? I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary all's right with the world.
#unknown Ten thousand dollars.
#unknown Ten thousand, cash to you.
#unknown I'm not saying to throw the case.
#unknown Just no talking to the DEA.
#unknown Are you saying what I think you're saying? Yes.
#unknown What's it going to be? What, dude wouldn't take a bribe? That dude in there? Saul Goodman we're talking about? Yeah.
#unknown "Morally outraged," he said.
#unknown Threatened to call the police.
#unknown Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?  Like the Exxon Valdez.
#unknown So, what do we do about it? Hey, Francesca, how about I follow you home? No.
#unknown For safety.
#unknown What? God, you are killing me with that booty.
#unknown Talk to me.
#unknown Come on, talk to me, guys, huh? Come on, just tell me what you want.
#unknown Jesus! Oh, no, no, no! No, it wasn't me.
#unknown It was Ignacio.
#unknown He's the one.
#unknown Oh, no.
#unknown Oh, no, no, no.
#unknown Shut up, dude.
#unknown Shut up, all right? Just speak English.
#unknown Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?  Who?  Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ! Oh, I thought What can I do for you gentlemen? Anything.
#unknown Just tell me what you need.
#unknown This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000.
#unknown You should have taken it.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown This is in regards to what'shisname? Badger! Brandon Mayhew.
#unknown The uncle.
#unknown That was your guy? No of fence, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know? Better safe than sorry.
#unknown That's my motto.
#unknown But I'll take your money! Sure!  No, that offer has expired, yo.
#unknown It was kind of low anyways.
#unknown But okay, okay, I'll take it.
#unknown Just tell me what you need, all right? I'm easy.
#unknown I'm gonna keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
#unknown All right, listen to me very carefully.
#unknown You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
#unknown But no deals with the DEA.
#unknown All right? Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
#unknown If he does, you're dead.
#unknown Why don't you just kill Badger? I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito is buzzing around you and it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney.
#unknown You go grab a fly swatter.
#unknown I mean, so to speak.
#unknown I mean, all due respect, but do I have to spell this out for you?  We're not killing Badger, yo!  Then you got real problems, okay.
#unknown Because the DEA will come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
#unknown I don't think I'm going out on a limb here but, hey, he's not gonna like prison.
#unknown He's gonna sing like Celine Dion regardless of what you do to me.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Mayhew? I recognise your cough.
#unknown Take that mask off, you know.
#unknown Get some air.
#unknown Go on.
#unknown God.
#unknown Take it easy.
#unknown Breathe in, breathe out.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I'm gonna stand up, all right? Because I got bad knees.
#unknown That's better.
#unknown Okay, now listen.
#unknown The three of us are gonna work this out.
#unknown Yeah? How? First thing, you'll put a dollar in my pocket, both of you.
#unknown You want attorneyclient privilege, don't you? So that everything you say is strictly between us.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown Put a dollar in my pocket.
#unknown Come on, make it official.
#unknown Come on, do it.
#unknown That's it, come on.
#unknown Just a dollar.
#unknown All right, now you, ski bum.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Give with the dollar.
#unknown Go on.
#unknown Be smart.
#unknown What?  All I got is a five.
#unknown I'll take a five.
#unknown Come on, already.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Be cool.
#unknown Okay, you're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates.
#unknown Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment.
#unknown All right? Take the ski mask off.
#unknown I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
#unknown Just do it.
#unknown Okay, so if a prison shanking is completely off the table And we're sure of that? No shanking! All right, all right.
#unknown The way I see it is somebody is going to prison.
#unknown It's just a matter of who.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Lameass TV ads aside your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.
#unknown Time served, no probation.
#unknown It's pretty slick.
#unknown Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
#unknown Don't get cocky.
#unknown You ain't home free yet.
#unknown You don't give us the name of your supplier  you're going nowhere.
#unknown The tough guy act is unnecessary.
#unknown This young man is cooperating fully.
#unknown Is that right? Yeah, you cooperating? Okay, let's start with a name.
#unknown He just goes by Heisenberg.
#unknown Heisenberg, huh? How old is this Heisenberg? Old.
#unknown Like 50 or 70 or something.

#unknown is convicted of stealing a vending machine.
#unknown And here he is today.
#unknown Better known as Jimmy In'NOut.
#unknown City, state and federal, he's spent Entire life behind bars.
#unknown Jimmy provides a very special service.
#unknown For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you.
#unknown On purpose? The guy goes to prison on purpose? He's actually more comfortable inside.
#unknown The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
#unknown Sometime during the Clinton administration Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
#unknown So when does all this happen?  It's already happening.
#unknown The buy is set for tomorrow.
#unknown Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy and all it's gonna cost you is 80 thousand and one pound of your finest meth.
#unknown Eighty thousand dollars for eight years of his life, huh? First of all, he's not gonna do eight years.
#unknown I'll represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case.
#unknown Secondly, he gets 30.
#unknown Fifty goes to me.
#unknown You get 50? For what?  For facilitating.

#unknown We'll talk about it later.
#unknown Just floor it.
#unknown Should I back up?  Go that way.
#unknown Forward is better? I'll be out of the way there.
#unknown Okay, okay.
#unknown I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.
#unknown I'll leave you alone.
#unknown We'll talk later.
#unknown Just go.
#unknown Where'd he go? Where the hell did he go? Oh, wait.
#unknown Wait, wait, wait.
#unknown Got him.
#unknown Looks like it's going down.
#unknown Take him.
#unknown Freeze! Hey, right there.
#unknown Don't move.
#unknown Come on, let's get him up.
#unknown Jesus! I think they bought it.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Textbook bust, sir.
#unknown Yes, sir.
#unknown Looks like we got a full pound of the blue stuff.
#unknown Oh, and Heisenberg's real name? James Kilkelly.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thank you very much.
#unknown It was my pleasure.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown You weren't home, so I let the delivery guys in.
#unknown I hope that's okay.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown So you bought a bed.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown What is that, a king? Pillow top? Oh, my God.
#unknown You really are a chemistry teacher.
#unknown You mind? I was terrible at chemistry.
#unknown I'm more of a humanities guy.
#unknown How did you find me?  We should talk about that.
#unknown It should be much, much harder for people to track you down.
#unknown My Pl charged me for three hours so I seriously doubt it took him more than one.
#unknown So this is, what, blackmail? Walter, I'm your lawyer.
#unknown Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
#unknown I'm not in the shakedown racket.
#unknown I'm a lawyer.
#unknown Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers.
#unknown So, what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart? Come on.
#unknown Have you seen my hourly rate? By the way, where do you keep the money? Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar buried in the side yard? This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up but he won't be the last.
#unknown And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be? I don't understand.
#unknown What exactly are you offering to do for me? What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone? I'm no Vito Corleone.
#unknown No shit.
#unknown Right now, you're Fredo.
#unknown But with some sound advice and the proper introductions, who knows? I'll tell you, you've got the right product.
#unknown Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch you're on to something special.
#unknown And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
#unknown Food for thought, yeah? So if you wanna make more money and keep the money that you make better call Saul! "Breaking Bad Season 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 + Extras BDRip DVDRip HDTV TSV"
