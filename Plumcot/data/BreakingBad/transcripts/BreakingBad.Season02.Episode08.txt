walter_white  Oh, yes.
saul_goodman  Mayhew.
saul_goodman  Is that Irish or English?
walter_white  Irish.
saul_goodman  Faith and begorra.
saul_goodman  A fellow potatoeater.
saul_goodman  My real name is McGill.
saul_goodman  The Jew thing I just do for the homeboys.
saul_goodman  They all want a pipehitting member of the tribe, so to speak.
saul_goodman  I digress.
saul_goodman  Good things are happening.
saul_goodman  Fact is, your nephew is gonna get out in no time.
walter_white  That's wonderful, yeah.
saul_goodman  There's still a few details to be ironed out but now that the DEA is involved I think he's looking at time served, then probation.
saul_goodman  So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch.
walter_white  Excuse me, the DEA?
saul_goodman  Yeah.
saul_goodman  That's the Drug Enforcement Administration. The
saul_goodman  The feds.
saul_goodman  I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers.
walter_white  I understand that.
walter_white  What does that have to do with the DEA?
saul_goodman  They're after some mystery man some heavyhitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.
saul_goodman  They want this guy like the axe wants the turkey.
saul_goodman  Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
saul_goodman  Jesus, cheer up.
saul_goodman  This is good news.
saul_goodman  I mean, Brandon fell headfirst into the doodoo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne.
walter_white  wait. Look
walter_white  Look, I just I think I just think that we should review our options.
saul_goodman  Options?
saul_goodman  I'm gonna tell you what your options are. You
saul_goodman  You got a grand total of two. Option
saul_goodman  Option A : Brandon takes the deal.
saul_goodman  Option B : Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big.
walter_white  Look, look.
walter_white  What about reprisals? I
walter_white  I mean, if Badger
walter_white  If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg I mean, what if, God forbid that they decide to take revenge?
saul_goodman  What have you been telling him
saul_goodman  The kid keeps spouting off about," if I talk, they'll kill me.
saul_goodman  Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal.
saul_goodman  No, that's not good.
saul_goodman  That's terrible.
saul_goodman  Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks. You
saul_goodman  You let him take his chances on the outside.
saul_goodman  Maybe I can work in some witness protection.
walter_white  No, look, look.
walter_white  These are vicious, desperate people.
walter_white  I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
saul_goodman  People love to take credit for the fun ones.
saul_goodman  The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
saul_goodman  His wife killed him, all right?
saul_goodman  It was open and shut.
saul_goodman  Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?
saul_goodman  I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary all's right with the world.
walter_white  Ten thousand dollars.
walter_white  Ten thousand, cash to you.
walter_white  I'm not saying to throw the case.
walter_white  Just no talking to the DEA.
saul_goodman  Are you saying what I think you're saying?
walter_white  What's it going to be?
jesse_pinkman  What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?
jesse_pinkman  That dude in there?
jesse_pinkman  Saul Goodman we're talking about?
walter_white  Yeah."
walter_white  Morally outraged," he said.
walter_white  Threatened to call the police.
jesse_pinkman  Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
walter_white  the Exxon Valdez.
jesse_pinkman  So, what do we do about it
saul_goodman  Hey, Francesca, how about I follow you home?
francesca_liddy  No.
saul_goodman  For safety.
saul_goodman  What?
saul_goodman  God, you are killing me with that booty.
saul_goodman  to me. Come on, talk to me, guys,
saul_goodman  on, just tell me what you want.
saul_goodman  Jesus! Oh, no, no, no! No
saul_goodman  No, it wasn't me.
saul_goodman  It was Ignacio. He's
saul_goodman  He's the one.
saul_goodman  Oh
jesse_pinkman  Shut up, all right
jesse_pinkman  Just
jesse_pinkman  Just speak English.
saul_goodman  Lalo didn't send you?
saul_goodman  Lalo? Who? Oh, thank God!
saul_goodman  Oh, Christ!
saul_goodman  Oh
saul_goodman  What can I do for you gentlemen?
saul_goodman  Anything. Just
saul_goodman  Just tell me what you need. This
jesse_pinkman  This afternoon, an associate of ours offered you $10,000.
jesse_pinkman  You should have taken it.
saul_goodman  Wait a minute. This
saul_goodman  This is in regards to what'shisname? Badger
jesse_pinkman  Badger!
jesse_pinkman  Brandon Mayhew.
saul_goodman  The uncle. That was your guy?
saul_goodman  No of fence, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know
saul_goodman  Better safe than sorry.
saul_goodman  That's my motto.
saul_goodman  But I'll take your money!
saul_goodman  Sure! No
jesse_pinkman  No, that offer has expired, yo.
saul_goodman  It was kind of low anyways.
saul_goodman  But okay, okay, I'll take it.
saul_goodman  Just tell me what you need, all right?
saul_goodman  I'm easy.
saul_goodman  I'm gonna keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
saul_goodman  All right, listen to me very carefully.
jesse_pinkman  You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
jesse_pinkman  But no deals with the DEA.
jesse_pinkman  All right?
jesse_pinkman  Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
jesse_pinkman  If he does, you're dead.
saul_goodman  Why don't you just kill Badger?
saul_goodman  I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito is buzzing around you and it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the mosquito's attorney.
saul_goodman  You go grab a fly swatter.
saul_goodman  I mean, so to speak.
saul_goodman  I mean, all due respect, but do I have to spell this out for you?
jesse_pinkman  We're not killing Badger, yo!
saul_goodman  Then you got real problems, okay.
saul_goodman  Because the DEA will come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
saul_goodman  I don't think I'm going out on a limb here but, hey, he's not gonna like prison.
