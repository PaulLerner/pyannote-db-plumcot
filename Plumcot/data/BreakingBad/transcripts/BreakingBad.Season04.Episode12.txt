hank_schrader  you? Hey, hey,
hank_schrader  hey. Lay off your mom.
marie_schrader  Well, you know, Hank we

skyler_white  a sudden l'm on lockdown for my protection? Gus Fring? Did you say? What?
walter_white_jr.  From the chicken restaurant?
skyler_white  Hank, what are you talking about?
hank_schrader  Just one man's humble opinion,
hank_schrader  that's all. l think Los Pollos Hermanos is a front for the biggest meth distributor in the Southwest.
marie_schrader  Oh, my God.
marie_schrader  Oh
skyler_white  Oh, my God. Steve, are you even looking into this?
steven_gomez  We're looking into everything.
steven_gomez  But we work on fact, not conjecture.
steven_gomez  And the fact is that the scumbags that hit you first were Mexican cartel not some German multinational whatever.
steven_gomez  Definitely not Colonel Sanders.
steven_gomez  Now, if we even had a shred of proof lsn't
hank_schrader  lsn't that what you get paid to go get?
hank_schrader  Remember that laundry l told you about?
hank_schrader  l'd start there.
hank_schrader  Come on, man.
steven_gomez  lt's a
hank_schrader  a perfect spot for a meth superlab.
hank_schrader  Oh, my God. Hey what if l'm right?
steven_gomez  Even if you were right And you ain't.
steven_gomez  there's no way a judge is gonna give me a warrant.
hank_schrader  Warrant?
hank_schrader  What happened to good oldfashioned knock and talk?
hank_schrader  Oh, that's right.
hank_schrader  l forgot.
hank_schrader  You were never very good at those, were you
dennis_markowski  Can l help you?
steven_gomez  Yes, sir.
steven_gomez  We wondered if we could take a look around.
steven_gomez  Sorry, what's your name
dennis_markowski  Dennis.
steven_gomez  Dennis.
steven_gomez  Hey. l'm
steven_gomez  l'm Steve Gomez.

steven_gomez  Drug Enforcement.
dennis_markowski  there a problem?
steven_gomez  For you?
steven_gomez  No.
steven_gomez  No problem.
steven_gomez  We were just wondering if we could take a look around.
steven_gomez  l tell you a story?
steven_gomez  Yeah. l bust this chef.
steven_gomez  Well, he says he's a chef.
steven_gomez  Because you work at a restaurant that charges $14 for a burger that don't make you a chef.
steven_gomez  Makes you a burgerflipper. Least
steven_gomez  my book.
dennis_markowski  Yeah.
steven_gomez  Anyway, so we bust this chef, heroin possession.
steven_gomez  He says," Just because you found heroin in my chef whites doesn't make it
steven_gomez  Maybe it came from the place that launders my chef whites.
steven_gomez  This place.
dennis_markowski  We don't do that stuff over here.
steven_gomez  l know, l know. l'll say it for you.
steven_gomez  His story is a big load of steaming horse shit.
steven_gomez  We're gonna find heroin here like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa.
steven_gomez  Right
steven_gomez  The thing is that this chef's daddy is a United States senator.
steven_gomez  l'm not gonna tell which one, but you know who he is
steven_gomez  So now l gotta waste my time checking out this burgerflipper's story.
steven_gomez  lf l don't, his old man's gonna jam me up my ASAC, my whole entire office.
steven_gomez  Politics
steven_gomez  Politics, huh?
dennis_markowski  what do you think? Listen, l have to check on my boss.
dennis_markowski  He's out of town.
dennis_markowski  l can't promise l'll reach him anytime soon.
steven_gomez  That's
steven_gomez  That's probably the way to go.
steven_gomez  l'll have to go get a warrant and we'll do it official.
steven_gomez  You have to close down for the day
dennis_markowski  Why? Twenty
steven_gomez  Twenty agents poking around?
steven_gomez  be less trouble if it was just us.
steven_gomez  But your call.
dennis_markowski  Just the two of you?
dennis_markowski  You make it quick, right?
steven_gomez  Dennis, we'll be like the wind.
steven_gomez  Okay.
steven_gomez  Could you tell him? Okay. Okay. Can you clear out some of your people for us?
steven_gomez  Confuses the dog's nose.
