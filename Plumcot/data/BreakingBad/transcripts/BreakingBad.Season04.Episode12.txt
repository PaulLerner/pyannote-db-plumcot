#unknown They're here, out front.
#unknown How many? Nelson Brey, three others.
#unknown His toothbrush? Got it.
#unknown What about your stuff? Oh, we'll talk to them about stopping at your place.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown What? l'm not going.
#unknown What? l'm not going to Hank and Marie's.
#unknown We're in danger.
#unknown Yes, that's true.
#unknown Because of me.
#unknown lt doesn't matter.
#unknown All that matters is the rest of you are safe.
#unknown And that's why l'm not going with you.
#unknown l'm the real target.
#unknown But we'll all be safer at Hank's.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown No one will be safe at Hank's if l'm there.
#unknown Walt, it's the DEA.
#unknown Skyler, you don't know these people.
#unknown l No.
#unknown Skyler, please.
#unknown Trust me.
#unknown This is how it has to be.
#unknown Those agents outside.
#unknown They're not gonna just leave you here.
#unknown lt's protective custody.
#unknown All they know is that Hank is the only person that's in danger.
#unknown They're including us as a courtesy to Marie, to keep her happy.
#unknown How am l supposed to explain that to Marie or Junior? Or Hank? l don't know.
#unknown But you'll do it.
#unknown You'll figure it out.
#unknown Hank knows that Marie will be overreacting.
#unknown Except she's not.
#unknown l'll talk to Hank.
#unknown You just back me up with everyone else.
#unknown You really expect me to say, "Okay, Walt, sure.
#unknown Just stay here and".
#unknown No.
#unknown There's gotta be another way.
#unknown There isn't.
#unknown There was.
#unknown But now there isn't.
#unknown Walt how long till you're safe? Till you can work this out? Oh, Skyler.
#unknown No.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown No.
#unknown l Listen to me.
#unknown l alone should suffer the consequences of those choices, no one else.
#unknown And those consequences they're coming.
#unknown No more prolonging the inevitable.
#unknown Feed that belt through those seatbelt holders.
#unknown Hank, l've got a car wash to run.
#unknown l mean, you don't honestly believe that l'm in danger, do you? Me? Oh, Jesus, it's gonna go over like a lead balloon.
#unknown lt'll be Marie that kills me.
#unknown Well, just know that l'll get there as soon as l can.
#unknown And let Steve Gomez know.
#unknown l told his guys.
#unknown And just stay safe.
#unknown Oh, please.
#unknown Whole thing's just a giant jerkoff.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown But keep your head down anyway, all right? All right.
#unknown All right, buddy.
#unknown Take care.
#unknown l know.
#unknown Okay, sweetie.
#unknown Okay, my love.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay, my darling.
#unknown lt's okay.
#unknown We're all right.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown He's gonna risk his life over a stupid car wash? Does he understand what's going on with Uncle Hank? He'll come when he's able.
#unknown That's pathetic.
#unknown l How hard did you even try or did you? Hey, hey, hey.
#unknown Lay off your mom.
#unknown Well, you know, Hank we wouldn't be arguing about this if you and Steve would make him come.
#unknown Why didn't your people put him in the car? lt's not Nazi Germany, all right? Oh, you Nazi Germany.
#unknown lf l had a dollar for every time l heard that.
#unknown l'm gonna call him.
#unknown He's gonna get his behind here immediately.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown At least somebody is listening.
#unknown Because we are all in danger here.
#unknown We're not all in danger here.
#unknown Will you stop saying that? That is asking for trouble.
#unknown Come on, Walt.
#unknown He's not picking up.
#unknown Look, could we just take this down a notch, okay? Everybody? You guys can stay here as long as you like.
#unknown We got plenty of room.
#unknown l wouldn't worry about any danger to Walt or any of us, okay? This whole thing is just a damn smoke screen.
#unknown How do you mean "a smoke screen"? An anonymous threat against me? l'm stuck in a wheelchair, l'm not even on the job.
#unknown No, someone didn't like the way l've been spending my free time.
#unknown What? Minerals? Timing seem a bit odd to you, huh? l start looking into Fring, all of a sudden l'm on lockdown for my protection? Gus Fring? Did you say? What? From the chicken restaurant? Hank, what are you talking about? Just one man's humble opinion, that's all.
#unknown l think Los Pollos Hermanos is a front for the biggest meth distributor in the Southwest.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Steve, are you even looking into this? We're looking into everything.
#unknown But we work on fact, not conjecture.
#unknown And the fact is that the scumbags that hit you first were Mexican cartel not some German multinational whatever.
#unknown Definitely not Colonel Sanders.
#unknown Now, if we even had a shred of proof lsn't that what you get paid to go get? Remember that laundry l told you about? l'd start there.
#unknown Come on, man.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown lt's a perfect spot for a meth superlab.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Hey what if l'm right? Even if you were right And you ain't.
#unknown there's no way a judge is gonna give me a warrant.
#unknown Warrant? What happened to good oldfashioned knock and talk? Oh, that's right.
#unknown l forgot.
#unknown You were never very good at those, were you? Can l help you? Yes, sir.
#unknown We wondered if we could take a look around.
#unknown Why? Sorry, what's your name? Dennis.
#unknown Dennis.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown l'm Steve Gomez.
#unknown l'm with the DEA.
#unknown Drug Enforcement.
#unknown ls there a problem? For you? No.
#unknown No problem.
#unknown We were just wondering if we could take a look around.
#unknown Can l tell you a story? Yeah.
#unknown l bust this chef.
#unknown Well, he says he's a chef.
#unknown Because you work at a restaurant that charges $14 for a burger that don't make you a chef.
#unknown Makes you a burgerflipper.
#unknown Least in my book.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Anyway, so we bust this chef, heroin possession.
#unknown He says, "Just because you found heroin in my chef whites doesn't make it mine.
#unknown Maybe it came from the place that launders my chef whites.
#unknown " This place.
#unknown We don't do that stuff over here.
#unknown l know, l know.
#unknown l'll say it for you.
#unknown His story is a big load of steaming horse shit.
#unknown We're gonna find heroin here like we're gonna find Jimmy Hoffa.
#unknown Right? The thing is that this chef's daddy is a United States senator.
#unknown l'm not gonna tell which one, but you know who he is.
#unknown So now l gotta waste my time checking out this burgerflipper's story.
#unknown lf l don't, his old man's gonna jam me up my ASAC, my whole entire office.
#unknown Politics, huh? So, what do you think? Listen, l have to check on my boss.
#unknown He's out of town.
#unknown l can't promise l'll reach him anytime soon.
#unknown Well, yeah.
#unknown That's probably the way to go.
#unknown l'll have to go get a warrant and we'll do it official.
#unknown You have to close down for the day.
#unknown What? Why? Twenty agents poking around? lt'd be less trouble if it was just us.
#unknown But your call.
#unknown Just the two of you? You make it quick, right? Dennis, we'll be like the wind.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Could you tell him? Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Can you clear out some of your people for us? Confuses the dog's nose.
#unknown So how long we gotta be quiet down here? And what happens after this? Provided they don't find their way in here and bust our asses? l gotta be, like, snuck down here in a laundry hamper for the rest of eternity? Now, l'm going on record.
#unknown This blows.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown For you.
#unknown Yeah? Do you know what's happening upstairs? l have a pretty good idea.
#unknown This is all the result of your former partner.
#unknown Do you understand now? Do you see why this can't continue? l get it.
#unknown The guy is a complete and total dick.
#unknown But l can't.
#unknown l'm not signing off.
#unknown Okay? Like l said if something final happens to Mr.
#unknown White we're going to have a problem.
#unknown So, what are you gonna do? There will be an appropriate response.
#unknown Appropriate? What does that mean? Hello? They're gone.
#unknown We're good.

#unknown Today, he didn't show up to work and the DEA just happened to raid us.
#unknown Yeah, some coincidence, huh? Yeah, l don't know about that.
#unknown All l know is when he tells me that your employer took him out threatening to murder his family, l take notice.
#unknown Because after all, what am l, if not family? What are you talking about? When did that happen? l don't know.
#unknown Forget it.
#unknown l mean, he exaggerates, right? He does that.
#unknown Hey, listen.
#unknown Do me a favor.
#unknown Put in a good word for me with Fring.
#unknown l mean, just for old time's sake.
#unknown l can't afford to butter the wrong bread here.

#unknown What does it matter? Everything, it's all coming to an end.
#unknown Do you even know what's happening? The full scope of what's happening? They took me out into the desert.
#unknown They put a hood over my head and drove me out into the desert on my knees.
#unknown They threatened my family, and not just Hank.
#unknown My wife, my children.
#unknown lt's just a matter of time now.
#unknown l was able to protect them for now, but.
#unknown Gus is gonna make his move.
#unknown And l don't l don't know when.
#unknown l don't know where or how.
#unknown All l know is it's gonna happen.
#unknown And l'm powerless to stop him.
#unknown What are you doing? Why did you do it? Why? Jesse.
#unknown Gus gave me no choice.
#unknown l had to call the DEA to protect my family.
#unknown What else could l do? No.
#unknown No, you son of a bitch.
#unknown You know what you did.
#unknown Okay, look, just Just put the gun down, okay? Just put it down and we'll talk, all right? You tell me what it is you think l did.
#unknown Brock.
#unknown Why did you poison him? Who's Brock? You saw him in my living room.
#unknown You came and you looked right at him, so don't tell me you don't know him.
#unknown The boy? Jesse, l have no idea who these people are.
#unknown Now, please.
#unknown Okay, that's Brock and he was poisoned? The ricin.
#unknown He's dying because someone gave it to him.
#unknown And only you and l were the only two people on earth who knew about it.
#unknown No, wait a minute.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown Maybe he went into your pockets No! l had it.
#unknown l had the cigarette with the ricin in my pack this morning.
#unknown The last time l saw Brock was last night.
#unknown And this morning, l switched the cigarette into a new pack.
#unknown There's no way Brock took it himself.
#unknown Jesse, you're not thinking clearly.
#unknown You said it yourself that you had it this morning.
#unknown When could l have possibly gotten it? You had Saul do it.
#unknown What? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown l went to his office.
#unknown He called me in, had to see me today.
#unknown His big bodyguard patted me down.
#unknown That's when he must have stole it off me.
#unknown Right? That's the plan? Was that the plan? Jesse.
#unknown Why? Why in God's name would l poison a child? To get back at me.
#unknown Because l'm helping Gus and this is your way of ripping my heart out before you're dead and gone.
#unknown Just admit it.
#unknown Admit what you did.
#unknown Admit it.
#unknown l did not do this! Shut up! Stop lying! Look, l'm not lying.
#unknown l'm not lying.
#unknown Just listen to me.
#unknown What would l have to gain? What possible? Possible could l? Who? who would? Oh, my God.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Stop laughing.
#unknown Stop laughing! l have been waiting l've been waiting all day waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me.
#unknown And it's you.
#unknown Who do you know who's okay with using children? Jesse, who do you know who's allowed children to be murdered? Gus.
#unknown He has been 1 0 steps ahead of me at every turn.
#unknown And now, the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent.
#unknown And, boy, he's got that now.
#unknown He's got it.
#unknown And not only does he have that he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him.
#unknown No, only you and l knew about the ricin.
#unknown No, you don't even believe that.
#unknown Gus has cameras everywhere.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Listen to yourself.
#unknown No, he has known everything all along.
#unknown Where were you today? ln the lab? You don't think it's possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? Come on.
#unknown Don't you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle.
#unknown You are everything that he's wanted.
#unknown You're his cook now.
#unknown You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me.
#unknown And now that cook has reason to kill me.
#unknown Think about it.
#unknown lt's brilliant.
#unknown So go ahead.
#unknown Go on.
#unknown lf you think that l am capable of doing this then go put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.
#unknown l'll do it.
#unknown Do it! Do it.
#unknown l'll do it.
#unknown Do it.
#unknown Where are you going? Find the son of a bitch and l'm gonna kill him.
#unknown No.
#unknown Don't.
#unknown He'll see you coming.
#unknown You'll die before you get anywhere near him.
#unknown l don't care.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse, just get in your car.
#unknown Just go.
#unknown Just drive.
#unknown No.
#unknown l'm going to do this one way or another, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Then let me help.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Pinkman, l'm not gonna keep telling you.
#unknown Unless the family wants you in there, you're not allowed.
#unknown You can't keep coming in here like this.
#unknown You hear me? You understand? Mr.
#unknown Pinkman, l'm gonna call security.
#unknown All right, here l go.
#unknown Come on now.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Pinkman, final warning.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown You need to be at work, now.
#unknown l already told you.
#unknown l'm not going.
#unknown Got a batch that'll be ruined and an employer who will be very upset if that happens.
#unknown And l could give a shit.
#unknown l'm not leaving here.
#unknown lf my employer has a problem with that, he can tell me himself.
#unknown Not his errand boy.
#unknown ldiot.
#unknown Hey, l don't know this guy.
#unknown Call security.
#unknown l'm being attacked.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown We've got a situation.
#unknown He'd like to speak with you.
#unknown l told you, l'm not leaving.
#unknown He's downstairs.
#unknown Tyrus told me what's happening.
#unknown The sick child.
#unknown l understand your preoccupation, but, Jesse, l am running a business.
#unknown l need you back at the lab to complete the cook.
#unknown You can return when you're done.
#unknown l can't.
#unknown lt is, as you must know, in both of our best interests.
#unknown That little boy upstairs is dying.
#unknown l can't be away.
#unknown l don't even wanna be here now.
#unknown l can't be away, if something happens, if he l am very sorry.
#unknown ls there anything l can do? l am on the board of this hospital.
#unknown l can recommend doctors make sure he gets whatever he needs.
#unknown The best treatment.
#unknown He's not sick.
#unknown He was poisoned.
#unknown How did that happen? The doctors they don't know.
#unknown This current batch is surely ruined now, correct? Stay with the boy.
#unknown Tyrus will dump what's there and clean the tanks.
#unknown You will start a new batch when you are ready to return.
#unknown Next week.
#unknown There you are.
#unknown Keep going.
#unknown Why did you stop? Come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Don't go, don't go, don't go.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Oh, shit.
#unknown No.
#unknown
