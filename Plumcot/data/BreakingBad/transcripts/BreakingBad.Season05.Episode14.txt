#unknown They're having a twoforone at Venezia's, and at this point I could eat a whole one by myself.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, sure.
#unknown I can I can pick up a pizza.
#unknown Hopefully Bogdan won't keep me too late.

#unknown Ah.
#unknown Whoa.
#unknown Simmer down there, sparky.
#unknown What the hell did we just walk into? Hey, Uncle Jack, I don't see Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown He was right here before.
#unknown Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?  No.
#unknown What do you figure? He may be headed down that gully there? That's the way I'd go.
#unknown Frankie, Lester, go find him.
#unknown Jack.
#unknown These guys are DEA.
#unknown No! Jack, no! Jack! Jack! Jack! No! No, don't! Jack, don't.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, Jack! Jack, no! Jack, no.
#unknown Don't kill him.

#unknown Get back here.
#unknown The hell not? He's DEA.
#unknown No, he's he's family.
#unknown Say again? He's my family.
#unknown He's my brotherinlaw.
#unknown Didn't cross your mind to maybe tell us you had a DEA agent for a brotherinlaw? Did you know about this? I called you off, remember? I told you not to come.
#unknown Well, it seems to me we did you a solid.
#unknown You weren't supposed to be here.
#unknown Too late now.
#unknown How's about you telling me what was going down out here.
#unknown Hmm? Yeah, you and your brotherinlaw don't seem to be getting along too well.
#unknown It doesn't doesn't matter.
#unknown It doesn't concern you.
#unknown We just wasted his partner here, and he's wearing a bullet.
#unknown So, yeah, I'd say it does concern me.
#unknown This is between him and me.
#unknown No cavalry comin'? No.
#unknown You bet your ass the cavalry's comin'.
#unknown No! No, no.
#unknown Jack.
#unknown Jack! No, the DEA doesn't know about this.
#unknown Not yet.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown Nothing can change what just happened, but you can walk out of here alive if you just promise us that you'll you'll let this go.
#unknown Yeah, I thought as much.
#unknown Sorry, man.
#unknown Just no scenario where this guy lives.
#unknown No, no, no, listen! I have money! I have money! It's buried out here.
#unknown It's It's $80 million.
#unknown So that's what got this party started, huh? But this money of yours won't do me much good in prison.
#unknown You can go anywhere.
#unknown You can do anything.
#unknown Think about it.
#unknown You can have any future that you want.
#unknown Jack.
#unknown And all you've got to do is let him go.
#unknown That's a hell of an offer.
#unknown What do you think, Fed? Would you take that deal? It's Hank.
#unknown His name is Hank.
#unknown How about it, Hank? Should I let you go? My name is ASAC Schrader.
#unknown And you can go fuck yourself.
#unknown Hank listen to me.
#unknown You gotta tell him.
#unknown You gotta tell him now that we can work this out.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Please.
#unknown What? You want me to beg? You're the smartest guy I ever met.
#unknown And you're too stupid to see he made up his mind ten minutes ago.
#unknown Do what you're gonna do.
#unknown Pretty specific directions.
#unknown You know, most people tell me to be somewhere, they say, "West on the 40, this or that exit, second gas station on the left.
#unknown " You know? This here? This is a whole other story.
#unknown That fancy phone of yours, where does it say this is exactly? Yeah Look at this.
#unknown Even brought a shovel.
#unknown Jack.
#unknown No sign of Pinkman.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Says this is it right here.
#unknown So dig.
#unknown What's that? A barrel? Couple barrels? Jesus.
#unknown Hell yeah! Oh, Jesus.
#unknown Would you look at that? Hell yeah! Goddamn.
#unknown Whoo! What are you waiting for? Yeah, boss.
#unknown Hell yeah.
#unknown Let me get on this side.
#unknown Out of there, man.
#unknown Oh Okay.
#unknown Pull a barrel off the truck and load it in the Chrysler.
#unknown Seriously? Jack.
#unknown That's, like, You sure you wanna do that? You gonna make me say it again? Go.
#unknown Go.
#unknown Chop, chop.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown What's with all the greed here? It's unattractive.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I'm leaving you a barrel.
#unknown Boys are gonna load it for you.
#unknown You got the keys for these cuffs? I'm sorry for your loss.
#unknown My nephew here, he respects you.
#unknown He would never forgive me if things went another way.
#unknown Also, I'll be honest, you caught me in one hell of a good mood.
#unknown So here's what's gonna happen.
#unknown You're gonna get in your car and you're gonna drive out of here.
#unknown All right? No hard feelings.
#unknown Understand me? We square? Hey, man, I gotta know we're square.
#unknown Or we're gonna have to go that other way.
#unknown Pinkman.
#unknown Pinkman.
#unknown You still owe me.
#unknown If you can find him, we'll kill him.
#unknown Found him.
#unknown No! Get off me! Get off! No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Good to go? Hey, Uncle Jack.
#unknown Well, he was out here with those feds.
#unknown Right? Working with them.
#unknown Shouldn't we maybe find out what he told them first? 'Cause, I mean, he had to have told them some stuff that might not be too good for us.
#unknown And I'll bet we could get it out of him back home.
#unknown I mean, I can do it.
#unknown Me and him, we got we got history.
#unknown And then, you know, we'd take care of the job after that.
#unknown Works for me.
#unknown Work for you?  Let's go.
#unknown No.
#unknown No! No! No! Wait.
#unknown I watched Jane die.
#unknown I was there.
#unknown And I watched her die.
#unknown I watched her overdose and choke to death.
#unknown I could have saved her.
#unknown But I didn't.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown That truck belong to you? It does.
#unknown I'd like to buy it.
#unknown It's not for sale.
#unknown Hey, Walt, it's me.
#unknown Um, just thought I'd try you again.
#unknown We were just wondering when you thought you'd be back, so, um, just give us a call whenever you can.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Hey, Aunt Marie.
#unknown Hey, sweetie.
#unknown I haven't seen you for a while.
#unknown What have you been up to? Oh, you know.
#unknown This and that.
#unknown Your mom and I need to talk, so thought I'd stop by.
#unknown Well, I, uh, wish you'd called first.
#unknown This isn't the best time.
#unknown Well, Flynn looks like he can hold down the fort.
#unknown Why don't we go into your office? I I got it.
#unknown Okay, honey.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Marie, I have nothing to say.
#unknown Well, I do.
#unknown So you can just sit there and listen.
#unknown I got a call from Hank.
#unknown He arrested Walt three hours ago.
#unknown It's over.
#unknown "Dead to rights" I believe is the expression.
#unknown Hank and Steve Gomez are working with a former associate of Walt's, Jesse Pinkman, whom I know you know, and Pinkman has supplied them with everything they need.
#unknown Hank is booking Walt as we speak.
#unknown And I, for one, could not be happier.
#unknown I almost didn't come here.
#unknown Christ, I barely even know who you are, and I sure as hell don't know if I can ever trust you again.
#unknown And then I think about how you are so upset with Walt and how you wanted the kids out of the house, and all of this makes me believe that there has got to be hope for you, that whatever he did to you can be undone.
#unknown All I know all I have been forcing myself to remember, is that you are my sister.
#unknown And so I'm here.
#unknown Marie.
#unknown Everything changes now.
#unknown And you have got to prepare yourself.
#unknown Hank will help you as much as he can.
#unknown I know he will.
#unknown And I will support you through this.
#unknown But I have conditions.
#unknown I want you to give me every single copy of that obscenity that the two of you made to discredit Hank.
#unknown That DVD.
#unknown Every single copy.
#unknown You understand me? Answer me.
#unknown Do you understand me? Yes.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Now dry your eyes and get Flynn in here, because you are going to tell him everything, and I mean everything, Skyler.
#unknown He deserves to know the truth from his family.
#unknown Not a bunch of uniformed strangers.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, he cannot No.
#unknown You tell him.
#unknown Or I will.
#unknown There's no way around this.
#unknown He needs to know, and he needs to know now.
#unknown No.
#unknown Look, I gave you what you wanted.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Man, please.
#unknown Hey, please.
#unknown I told you where to find the tape, okay? Hey, just just just go.
#unknown Just just go there.
#unknown Just go to his house and get it.
#unknown We're on it.
#unknown Get it! No one else knows about it.
#unknown Just me and his partner.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown No one else knows! I swear! Let's cook.
#unknown You're completely out of your mind.
#unknown It's the truth.
#unknown It is, Flynn.
#unknown Then both of you are out of your minds.
#unknown You're full of shit, is what you are.
#unknown Both of you.
#unknown If if this is true, then how could you keep this a secret? I mean, why? Why would you go along? I'll be asking myself that for the rest of my life.
#unknown So you're saying all of this time you were lying about this? I mean, so you're saying you're a liar.
#unknown You you just admitted it.
#unknown So were you lying then, or are you lying now? Which lie is it? Flynn, honey, your mother is telling you the truth.
#unknown Right here, right now.
#unknown Believe it.
#unknown You know what? This this is bullshit.
#unknown This is bullshit.
#unknown I wanna talk to dad.
#unknown Your dad's in custody.
#unknown You won't be able to talk to him for a while, sweetie.
#unknown I'm calling Uncle Hank.
#unknown I've tried.
#unknown He's not answering.
#unknown Probably because he is in the thick of it with your father.
#unknown Honey, I know this is a lot to process, Flynn, but if you could just breathe.
#unknown Just try to breathe, and just trust Really? Really? Try to breathe? Oh, my God.
#unknown Go home.
#unknown Just take the kids home, okay? Go home and regroup.
#unknown I'll stop by later.
#unknown Flynn? Could you put your seatbelt on please? Please.
#unknown It's not safe.
#unknown You're shittin' me, right? If all this is true and you knew about it, then then you're as bad as him.
#unknown Whose truck is that? Dad? Listen.
#unknown I need you to come inside and pack right now.
#unknown Mom, Aunt Marie, they said that you were arrested? No, just They say that you're some kind of drug dealer? No, just come inside, please.
