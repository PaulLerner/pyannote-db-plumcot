#unknown Well, that clears things up.
#unknown I don't like him Bogdan.
#unknown He was condescending to me, rude about you, and I do not like him.
#unknown Simple as that.
#unknown Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do, but, uh, in this business, and Walt can back me up on this, the number 1 rule is Don't take things personally.
#unknown What do you What do you mean, rude about me? Something along the lines of You weren't man enough to face him yourself.
#unknown What? That you had to send your woman to do your business for you.
#unknown Okay, uh, speaking as your lawyer, I'm going to go on record and say this is a bad idea.

#unknown So, what's up? Well, actually, I could use your help on something.
#unknown Homicide, possibly drugrelated.
#unknown You want my help on the case? What am I, Ironside? No.
#unknown But you're a drug cop who knows the local talent, and you're a pal I just did a favor for, so let me pick your brain a second.
#unknown You ever come across a guy by the name of Gale Boetticher? No.
#unknown Someone came along and shot him in the face.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown No signs of forced entry, no signs of robbery.
#unknown Okay, so it's a crime of passion.
#unknown Where's the drug angle? We found a notebook at his place.
#unknown I made a copy for you in case your interested.
#unknown Looks like it pertains to some kind of methamphetamine superlab.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown It's filled with scientific formulas and chemical purchase lists Drawings, pages and pages of this stuff.
#unknown It looks big time, but I'm no authority, so I wonder if you might take a look.
#unknown Come on, Tim, seriously.
#unknown What is this, some kind of a charity thing? I thought your expertise could be useful here.
#unknown I'm lying here like, uh, third base, living from bowel movement to bowel movement.
#unknown I'm not even useful to myself.
#unknown Want my advice? Take this to Steve Gomez.
#unknown He'll help you out.
#unknown I give this to Steve Gomez, and all of a sudden it becomes a DEA case.
#unknown What good does that do me? If you could just take a look, tell me what I got here, I'd really appreciate it.
#unknown Eh.
#unknown Whatever.
#unknown Thanks, man.
#unknown You take it easy.
#unknown That's what I do.
#unknown Well, it was a good try.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown Time for your nap.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Oh, you're good.
#unknown So Nail salon sounded promising.
#unknown What do you think? I think we wait.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Skyler, it has been five hours.
#unknown He'll call.
#unknown Ahem.
#unknown Just wait.
#unknown Just wait.
#unknown Look.
#unknown It was a good idea.
#unknown It was a great idea.
#unknown But it didn't work.
#unknown So why don't we simply chalk it up as a learning White residence.
#unknown Oh, hello, Mr.
#unknown Wolynetz.
#unknown Am I still interested? Well, I I think that depends.
#unknown Yes, 879 was the original offer, but that seems high to me now.
#unknown Now I'm offering 800.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Don't do that.
#unknown Why?  Don't do that.
#unknown Well, because you're an unpleasant person, Mr.
#unknown Wolynetz.
#unknown You were rude to me and disrespectful towards my husband.
#unknown Skyler  And furthermore, I've met with quite a number of sellers, and the market seems much softer than I thought.
#unknown So 800.
#unknown You are talking crazy.
#unknown Uhhuh.
#unknown You are a very, very crazy lady.
#unknown Well, I understand that you're disappointed, but that is my final offer.
#unknown I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.
#unknown Goodbye.
#unknown What are you doing? I'm negotiating.
#unknown Why? Because I want to pay less.
#unknown Oh, now $79,000 less? Who cares? Do you know how much I make in a day? Yeah, but that's the very reason we need to negotiate.
#unknown We don't want to arouse suspicion by not trying to get a good deal.
#unknown Look, I get the logic.
#unknown I do.
#unknown But you just went too far with it.
#unknown You're calling him names? I didn't call him names.
#unknown Ohh.
#unknown I said he was unpleasant.
#unknown Ohh Well, he's not calling you back.
#unknown I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked.
#unknown Yeah, I do.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown No way.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown No.
#unknown So  Ahem.
#unknown It's time to move on, okay? I'm going to call Saul.
#unknown Where's my phone? Wait.
#unknown No.
#unknown What?  No, just  Wait, wait.
#unknown What for? Wait, wait.
#unknown For Oh, my God.

#unknown I mean, there's got to be thousands of them all over the world and on boats coming right for us.
#unknown And put on inside an ice cream truck, drive it into San Francisco.
#unknown I'm not even that scared of burning up in cannibalism.
#unknown To me the things that Thing that worries me is Is getting trampled or Or shoved up against a chain link fence because if you really think about it, if you were against a chain link fence and you've got a A lot I mean a lot of people trying to escape, pushing hard enough forward.
#unknown It's not a joke.
#unknown You're going to get squeezed right through the chain links like Pladoh or some kind of soft meat.
#unknown Uh, and this is inevitable, okay? And there's nothing you or me or anyone can do about it.
#unknown And if the fence posts are stuck deep Really deep with the cement way down inside the ground, then it's definitely happening to you.
#unknown Blood on the wall.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Bitch.
#unknown Somebody got shot.
#unknown Somebody probably got shot.
#unknown Like soft meat, man, right through Being squeezed through there like soft meat.

#unknown And Saul finally came through.
#unknown Ahem.
#unknown Well, I mean, he found the guy, right? Well, yes, he found the guy, but I told him what to do and what to say.

#unknown Throw him a bone.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown This is truly amazing.
#unknown Yes, well, it better be at $320 a bottle.
#unknown What? CuvÃ©e Pol Roget, Sir Winston Churchill.
#unknown Apparently, it was his favorite champagne, so they just named it after him.
#unknown How did you pay for it? What do you mean? Ah.
#unknown No.
#unknown Cash.
#unknown I paid cash.
#unknown No, I'm I'm asking how did you, Walter White, an unemployed schoolteacher, pay for it? How do you explain it? Skyler, no one saw me.
#unknown Whoever sold it to you did, and that's not the point.
#unknown The point is we're broke, remember? I mean, I'm waiting for your unemployment check to come so I can pay the phone bill.
#unknown I asked for an extension from the power company.
#unknown Why? Because on paper, we have no money.
#unknown You are completely overreacting.
#unknown I'm not apologizing for wanting to celebrate in some small way.
#unknown I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt.
#unknown I'm asking you to be smart.
#unknown I bought one bottle of champagne, one single bottle, Skyler.
#unknown I paid cash.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown That's all it takes, okay? I mean, look at Watergate.
#unknown One One little piece of duct tape  left in a door  Oh, my God.
#unknown Brought down the president of the United States.
#unknown What, I'm Nixon now? No, what I'm saying is the devil is in the details, okay? One little mistake, one slipup in our story, that could ruin us.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Got to destroy the evidence.
#unknown When I look at this This image that is part of the record, I am very concerned about what sort of distraction that can be, whether it's from any sort of signage but especially a signage that's changing every five seconds.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Any other questions? We have a motion and a second on the floor to grant the appeal.
#unknown All those in favor, raise your hand and say yes.
#unknown Yes is for the affirmative.
#unknown Those opposed? There's five no's, and that motion fails.
#unknown I would like to make a motion to uphold the decision.
