walter_white  Wait.
walter_white  Skyler, it has been five hours.
skyler_white  He'll call.
skyler_white  Just wait.
walter_white  Just wait.
walter_white  It was a good idea.
walter_white  It was a great idea. But it didn't work.
walter_white  So why don't we simply chalk it up as a learning
skyler_white  White residence.
skyler_white  Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.
skyler_white  Am I still interested?
skyler_white  Well, I I think that depends.
skyler_white  Yes, 879 was the original offer, but that seems high to me now.
skyler_white  Now I'm offering 800.
skyler_white  No, no, no. No,
walter_white  no. Don't do that. Why
skyler_white  Why? Don't
skyler_white  Well, because you're an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz.
skyler_white  You were rude to me and disrespectful towards my husband.
skyler_white  furthermore, I've met with quite a number of sellers, and the market seems much softer than I thought. So 800.
skyler_white  Well, I understand that you're disappointed, but that is my final offer.
skyler_white  I'm sorry we couldn't make it work.
skyler_white  Goodbye.
walter_white  What are you doing?
skyler_white  I'm negotiating.
walter_white  Why?
skyler_white  Because I want to pay less.
walter_white  Oh
walter_white  $79,000 less?
walter_white  Who cares?
walter_white  Do you know how much I make in a day?
skyler_white  Yeah, but that's the very reason we need to negotiate.
skyler_white  We don't want to arouse suspicion by not trying to get a good deal. Look
walter_white  I get the logic. I do. But you just went too far with it.
walter_white  You're calling him names?
skyler_white  didn't call him names.
skyler_white  Ohh. I said he was unpleasant.
walter_white  Well, he's not calling you back.
walter_white  I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked.
skyler_white  Yeah, I do.
walter_white  No way.
walter_white  Sorry.
walter_white  No.
walter_white  So Ahem. It's time to move on,
walter_white  okay?
