#unknown Here's my résumé.
#unknown I mean, technically it says "curriculum vitae," which I think is more professional, but, you know, same thing pretty much.
#unknown Great.
#unknown But this position truly is a noexperiencenecessary kind of thing.
#unknown Well, and it doesn't really say it here, but I have a solid background in sales.
#unknown I'm pretty much a selfstarter, so.
#unknown That's excellent, but  Excellent.
#unknown I really feel I could be a major, major asset to your sales force.
#unknown I'm thinking there's a little misunderstanding.
#unknown This isn't actually a sales job.
#unknown I mean, I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position, but our agents need to be licensed, have at least two years onthejob experience, and usually a college degree.
#unknown What you would be doing is more like advertising.
#unknown Hey, Jesse! Hey, man! Yo, man! What up? Badger? Where you been keeping yourself? Nice duds.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You, too.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Yo, why would you want to do this lame ass job anyway? I mean, no offense.
#unknown Because I'm on probation, yo.
#unknown Gotta prove to the man I'm rehabilitated.
#unknown Upstanding citizen.
#unknown All that shit.
#unknown It's really good exercise, too.
#unknown Look.
#unknown You can't just stand there.
#unknown You have to spin the arrow.
#unknown There's all these moves you have to learn, like the helicopter.
#unknown See? That one's a bitch.
#unknown I'm not very good at it yet.
#unknown No, you really opened my eyes to the possibilities.
#unknown Hey, anyways  Thanks for the toke.
#unknown Anytime.
#unknown Speaking of which  Thinking about retiring.
#unknown What? No! That stuff you made is unbelievable.
#unknown It was pretty awesome.
#unknown Retirement? I can't be hearing this! I had this partner who was helping me cook.
#unknown I mean, I was doing most of the work, but he was an asshole, so Anyway, pseudo's getting harder and harder to come by.
#unknown I can hook you up with some pseudo.
#unknown Major pseudo.
#unknown I got channels, bro.
#unknown We could partner up.
#unknown No pressure.
#unknown No pressure.
#unknown Just think about it, all right? I gotta go.
#unknown Yo, this way to savings! Save your dollars bills, yo! "Grey Matter" It's a stupid gift.
#unknown No, it isn't.
#unknown He'll love it.
#unknown I don't know what I was thinking.
#unknown Didn't the invitation even say "no gifts"?  Walt.
#unknown What? We have to go.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I'm not complaing.
#unknown Yes, you are.
#unknown Look, we need this.
#unknown We've been through a lot lately, okay? Guess we didn't get the beige memo.
#unknown We're okay.
#unknown Yes, I look like I'm wearing a prom dress from 1985.
#unknown Honey, you look fine.
#unknown Walt, this is the only thing I could find that fit me.
#unknown Would you look at that? The invitation said "no gifts.
#unknown " Oh, come on.
#unknown Sir, I'll take that for you.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You're welcome.
#unknown Oh, look, there's Elliott.

#unknown Actually, we recently found out that it's a girl.
#unknown Congratulations.
#unknown That's so wonderful.
#unknown We've been thinking about it for ourselves.
#unknown Yeah, thinking about it.
#unknown By the way, securing that patent was just amazing.

#unknown Shall we? Walt? I thought that was you.
#unknown Farley! Long time no see.
#unknown This Walter White.
#unknown Back at Cal Tech, he was you were just the master of crystallography.
#unknown I remember this one time, we were stuck on this protein problem for weeks! You just breezed right in and you had one word for us, too.
#unknown It was synchrotrons, yeah.
#unknown They generate purer and more complete patterns than xray beams.
#unknown Data collection takes a fraction of the time.
#unknown This is the White in Gray Matter.
#unknown Tell 'em, Walt.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, back when Elliott and I were in grad school, we came up with the name.
#unknown Schwartz: black.
#unknown Walter White.
#unknown So, together they became Gray Matter Technologies.
#unknown Cute, huh?  So you run the company with Elliott? Well, no.
#unknown No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.
#unknown I gravitated toward education.
#unknown What university? It's a Stratocaster! Not just any Strat.
#unknown That's one of Clapton's.
#unknown No way.
#unknown "To Elliott.
#unknown "Sorry about the buckle rash.
#unknown Eric Clapton.
#unknown " Thank you.
#unknown This is beautiful.
#unknown Why is he doing this? What is he, like eight years old? Here, honey.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Oh, this is from Walt.
#unknown God.
#unknown It's okay! YumGood Ramen.
#unknown This is what Walt and I lived on for while we were working on our thesis.
#unknown They sold them down at Ralsto's in the hardware aisle, right next to the the what was it?  Sterno.
#unknown The Sterno.
#unknown Yeah, 10 for $1.
#unknown 99.
#unknown To this day, I am convinced these noodles were responsible for our success.
#unknown This was our lifeblood.
#unknown Where'd you find these? I thought they'd been outlawed years ago.
#unknown I love it.
#unknown Thank you, Walt.
#unknown For the man who has everything.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown It was.
#unknown You remember the fat guy, the fat guy.
#unknown We used to call him "Snot Trough" because he had that thing under his n  What do you call that thing?  That was Dobkins! That was the same guy who always smelled like chocolate milk.
#unknown It was!  No, no, no, no.
#unknown It wasn't Dobkins.
#unknown It was Anyway, I swear to Christ he used to iron those patches onto the elbows of his Members Only jacket because he thought it made him look more distinguished.
#unknown Didn't it?  No.
#unknown Well, here's to Snot Trough.
#unknown To Snot Trough.
#unknown Wherever you may be.
#unknown God bless him.
#unknown And you remember the professor who used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen? Yes.
#unknown All you had to do was mention the Bunsen burner and he was off on a rant.
#unknown "No, he didn't invent it.
#unknown " You remember the waving? "He just improved it!" You know.
#unknown It was easy to kill Oh God, I miss this, Walt.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Me, too.
#unknown Listen, we ought to get together more often.
#unknown Skyler and I would love to have you and Gretchen over for dinner sometime.
#unknown Sure, yeah, absolutely.
#unknown But what I mean is that you and I should work together again.
#unknown Are you going to teach high school?  No, no.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown What's stopping us? Wait a minute.
#unknown Elliott, what are you Are you asking me to come work for you at Gray Matter? Yeah.
#unknown Why not? You'd fit right in.
#unknown You're brilliant, you've got a ton of experience.
#unknown Well, I I wouldn't really know where to begin.
#unknown I mean God.
#unknown You have no idea.
#unknown I spend my days just drawing out atoms on the chalkboard and trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table.
#unknown Look, I understand.
#unknown You're a little rusty, but you're not seeing the upside here.
#unknown We could really benefit from a new set of eyes.
#unknown You know what it is when you been trying to crack some problem for months on end.
#unknown You get tunnel vision.
#unknown One guy thinking outside of the box You may be exactly what we need.
#unknown Well, listen, Elliott Your offer is very appealing.
#unknown It really is.
#unknown I thank you.
#unknown But There's something you should know.
#unknown I have some personal issues.
#unknown Look, there's nothing we can't work out.
#unknown Well, yeah, but it's complicated.
#unknown We can help you.
#unknown We have excellent health insurance.
#unknown The best.
#unknown Hey, did you try those prosciutto wrapped figs? They were, like, wow! They were just I must have had about 30 of those suckers.
#unknown And the seafood table.
#unknown Did you see that? They had lobster tail, they had crab legs, there was, like, shrimp Walt? What the hell did you say to Elliott? You told him about the cancer, didn't you? Didn't you? I can't believe it.
#unknown Okay, we were talking.
#unknown He asked how you were doing, and I am sorry, but I don't have the best poker face these days where that's concerned.
#unknown He knew something was wrong with you and he pressed me.
#unknown He pressed you.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Walt! When it came right down to it, I didn't know what else to do but tell him the truth.
#unknown The truth? How about you just said "he's fine," huh? Maybe you could've just have said that? "He's fine," and done.
#unknown I don't like the way you're talking to me.
#unknown I don't like the way you talk about my private affairs to people who are not even in our lives anymore.
#unknown What exactly did he say to you?  He offered me a job.
#unknown What?  Yes.
#unknown Kind of like some fig leaf, you know? Some facesaving bullshit that allowed me to generously accept his charity.
#unknown And then, when I turned that down, he flatout offered to pay for my treatment.
#unknown Which is exactly what you expected him to do, didn't you?  Didn't you?  No.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown I did not put him up Okay, what did you say? Walt? What do you think I said? Why? Walt  You ready to go?  I'm taking the bus.
#unknown Okay Bye, honey.
#unknown Hey, dude, are these bullet holes? No, man.
#unknown Those are for, like, you know, ventilation.
#unknown Cool.
#unknown Nice setup, huh?  Man.
#unknown This is nothing, man.
#unknown I used to have, like, twice as much glassware until my dumbass expartner drove us into a ditch and wrecked most of it.
#unknown Big ass beaker, huh? Wait, wait.
#unknown No, that's a Yeah, that's a boiling flask.
#unknown This is a beaker.
#unknown Here's a Griffin beaker, here's a volumetric beaker.
#unknown Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.
#unknown You got You really know your shit.
#unknown Well, it's just basic chemistry, yo.
#unknown So you got something for me? Oh, hells, yeah! Okay.
#unknown We're in business.
#unknown Right on, Badger.
#unknown Dude, check this out.
#unknown Jesus, what the hell are you bringing that for? Hunting.
#unknown We might see javelinas.
#unknown Are you going to help me or what? Badger! Let me see the money.
#unknown Nah, I need five each.
#unknown Come on, two more.
#unknown Here.
#unknown What about him? Are you kidding? He looks younger than us.
#unknown Whatever.
#unknown What about that guy?  Nah, he looks like a businessman.
#unknown So what? So, businessmen are always in a hurry.
#unknown They're always, like, going to some meeting or something.
#unknown Seriously, he's just going to say no.
#unknown This guy.
#unknown This is our guy.
#unknown You're up.
#unknown Why do I have to do it? Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.
#unknown Excuse me, hey.
#unknown We forgot our IDs and we were wondering if you could do us a favor and buy us a sixpack.
#unknown You know, what you're asking is illegal.
#unknown No, it's not? Yeah, it is.
#unknown Guess you win the jackpot.
#unknown This is not how I wanted to spend my night off.
#unknown Consider this your first and last warning.
#unknown Yes, sir.
#unknown You're lucky you got a good dad here.
#unknown If the other guys hadn't run, I could've talked my way out of it.
#unknown Not cool, man.
#unknown Not cool.
#unknown What, you never tried to buy beer when you were my age? No, I'm talking about you calling me and not your father.
#unknown How do you think that will make him feel? I don't even know what to say to you.
#unknown Just go.
#unknown I'll deal with you later.
#unknown Where's Walt? I haven't seen him since this morning.
#unknown Your guess is as good as mine.
#unknown Listen, do me a favor, all right? Don't tell him about the kid.
#unknown Just a teenager trying to score some beer, you know? You know.
#unknown Just growing pains.
#unknown I mean, he finds out his dad's sick, he starts acting out, you know? First the pot, and then this.
#unknown The pot?  You told me he was smoking reefer.
#unknown That's what Skyler told me.
#unknown I mean, you may as well have.
#unknown I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.
#unknown I was talking about Walt.
#unknown Excuse me? He admitted it.
#unknown He said he liked it.
#unknown Walt? I didn't think he had it in him.
#unknown It's like he's not himself lately.
#unknown I mean, why would anyone in their right mind choose not to do treatment? Especially when it's completely paid for? Why is he doing this? You know what we need to do? What we really need to do is sit him down, all of us, and get everything out on the table.
#unknown Talk it all through.
#unknown You mean an intervention? No, no.
#unknown Just a family meeting where everyone can voice their concerns and be heard.
#unknown You are a genius, bro! This cankenstein is unreal! When we get back, I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit 'cause we're gonna make some mad dough! It's not right.
#unknown What do you mean it's not right? It's cloudy.
#unknown It's not supposed to be cloudy.
#unknown That last time, it was glass.
#unknown So what? Cloudy, not cloudy, it looks good enough to me.
#unknown "Good enough.
#unknown " Yo, what are you doing? Are you out of your mind? I totally would've smoked that! It's not for you, it's for our customers.
#unknown They're gonna demand a certain standard.
#unknown What? What are you What? We'll just do it again until we get it right.
#unknown Walt Please have a seat and join us.
#unknown We can do better.
#unknown Don't you fucking think about it! Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted! You know how long I had to spin that stupid sign? Get off me, psycho! Helicopter, bitch! Open the door! Come back here, you bitch! I'm gonna mess you up! I really need to understand your thought process because clearly I don't.
#unknown I feel that this decision you've made is not only not in your best interest, it's not in the best interest of our entire family.
#unknown Look, Skyler  Not yet.
#unknown Please.
#unknown I have the Talking Pillow.
#unknown Everybody gets to speak their minds, remember? And then, you'll get your chance.
#unknown Money has always been an issue for us, I'll give you that.
#unknown But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in, I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help.
#unknown Maybe it's the way you were raised.
#unknown But, honey it's okay to lean on people now and again.
#unknown You need this treatment, and nothing can stop you from getting it, except you.
#unknown Am I allowed to respond? In a minute.
#unknown I think we need to go around the circle first.
#unknown Hank, would you like to start? Yeah.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, what I'll say is  No, take the Talking Pillow.
#unknown All right, look, buddy.
#unknown I know I don't get to tell you this enough, but I care about you a hell of a lot.
#unknown This cancer thing Let's just Let's face it.
#unknown You know, you were dealt a shit hand.
#unknown But sometimes your luck can change.
#unknown I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was, you know, I started with a shit hand and I ended up with a full house.
#unknown Okay? I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there.
#unknown Man, you gotta keep placing your bets.
#unknown Keep placing your bets.
#unknown Hank what the hell are you saying? Please, Marie, let him talk.
#unknown That's what we're here to do.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Go on, Hank.
#unknown Right, well Look at it this way, okay? It's the bottom of the 9th.
#unknown Bases are loaded.
#unknown You're up.
#unknown But you got a bum arm.
#unknown Right? There's no frickin' way you're gonna hit a homer.
#unknown So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat, or you can hold on to your pride and lose the game.
#unknown Get what I'm saying? No.
#unknown You got your pride, man.
#unknown I get it.
#unknown Okay? I get it.
#unknown If this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in, I'm with your old lady on this one.
#unknown I say take the money and run, you know.
#unknown Somebody want to take this thing? Here.
#unknown Yes, Walter Walter Jr.
#unknown , I'm sure you have about a million things to say, probably, and now is your chance.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown Just let it all out.
#unknown This is bullshit.
#unknown Hey, come on.
#unknown It's all right.
#unknown Talk.
#unknown Tell your dad how you feel.
#unknown I'm pissed off.
#unknown Tell him.
#unknown I'm pissed off, 'cause you're being You're You're a pussy.
#unknown You're, like, ready to give up.
#unknown God.
#unknown What if you gave up on me, huh? This here? All the stuff I've been through, and you're scared of a little chemotherapy? Me, personally? I think you should do whatever you want to do.
#unknown What? You told us to be honest about our feelings.
#unknown Walt's the one with cancer.
#unknown It's his decision.
#unknown It's not up to any of us.
#unknown Why in the hell would you do this? I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt.
#unknown But after sitting here and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it.
#unknown He's not gonna have a future if he doesn't get treatment.
#unknown I am a medical professional.
#unknown I xray people in treatment every day.
#unknown I see them every day, and you know what? Some of them are absolutely miserable.
#unknown Marie  I'm sorry, but it's true.
#unknown And some of them don't wanna spend their last weeks or months being picked at by doctors.
#unknown But they got talked into it by their families.
#unknown Could I get the pillow back? I agree with Marie on that.
#unknown What? Maybe Walt wants to die like a man.
#unknown I don't want him to die at all! That's the whole point of this.
#unknown So either help, or leave! Skyler, I just wanted to do you the courtesy of giving you my honest opinion.
#unknown You know, Marie, this is not debate club.
#unknown This is my husband's life.
#unknown I make one simple observation  My husband's life we're talking about!  Ladies.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown How dare you This is so stupid.
#unknown All right, I've got the Talking Pillow now.
#unknown Okay? We all, in this room, we love each other.
#unknown We want what's best for each other, and I know that.
#unknown I am very thankful for that.
#unknown But what I want What I want, what I need, is a choice.
#unknown What does that mean? Sometimes, I feel like I never actually make any of my own.
#unknown Choices, I mean.
#unknown My entire life, it just seems I never you know, had a real say about any of it.
#unknown Now this last one, cancer all I have left is how I choose to approach this.
#unknown Then make the right choice, Walt.
#unknown You're not the only one it affects.
#unknown What about your son? Don't you wanna see your daughter grow up? I just Of course, I do.
#unknown Skyler, you've read the statistics.
#unknown These doctors talking about surviving.
#unknown One year, two years, like it's the only thing that matters.
#unknown But what good is it, to just survive if I am too sick to work, to enjoy a meal, to make love? For what time I have left, I want to live in my own house.
#unknown I want to sleep in my own bed.
#unknown I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day, lose my hair, and lie around, too tired to get up and so nauseated that I can't even move my head.
#unknown And you cleaning up after me? Me, with some dead man, some artificially alive, just marking time? No.
#unknown No.
#unknown And that's how you would remember me.
#unknown That's the worst part.
#unknown So that is my thought process, Skyler.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I just I choose not to do it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown All right what? I'll do the treatment.
#unknown It's gonna be okay.
#unknown The lady from the billing office said they usually bill the insurance company directly, but since our HMO is not paying for it, we can pay up front with a credit card.
#unknown Good.
#unknown And then Elliott will send a check.
#unknown I will take care of it.
#unknown Walter White? Yes.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown See you in a minute.
#unknown Elliott.
#unknown Walt, it's Gretchen.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown Hey, Gretchen.
#unknown How are you? You know, it was really great seeing you two the other day.
#unknown What a party.
#unknown Elliott told me about the cancer.
#unknown I'm so sorry.
#unknown Well, you know, it is what it is, I guess.
#unknown I don't know what to say except I'm always here for you.
#unknown Both of us are.
#unknown We wanted you to know that.
#unknown Yeah, well, thank you.
#unknown Walt, Elliott's told me he had offered to pay for the treatment.
#unknown You have to accept.
#unknown That money, as far as we're both concerned, that belongs to you.
#unknown Even the name of our company, it's half yours.
#unknown Walt Is this about you and me? Gretchen, I really appreciate the offer.
#unknown I do.
#unknown But we're fine.
#unknown As it turns out, the insurance came through after all.
#unknown So I am covered.
#unknown Well, anyway, I really appreciate it.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Good, that's good news.
#unknown You know, that really was a great party.
#unknown Keep in touch, okay? Sure.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Thank you for calling.
#unknown You wanna cook?
