jesse_pinkman  Here's my résumé.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, technically it says" curriculum vitae," which I think is more professional, but, you know, same thing pretty much.
arroyo_realty_manager  Great.
arroyo_realty_manager  But this position truly is a noexperiencenecessary kind of thing. Well
jesse_pinkman  Well, and it doesn't really say it here, but I have a solid background in sales.
jesse_pinkman  I'm pretty much a selfstarter, so.
arroyo_realty_manager  That's excellent, but Excellent
jesse_pinkman  Excellent.
jesse_pinkman  I really feel I could be a major, major asset to your sales force.
arroyo_realty_manager  thinking there's a little misunderstanding.
arroyo_realty_manager  This isn't actually a sales job.
arroyo_realty_manager  I mean, I'd be happy to consider you for a sales position, but our agents need to be licensed, have at least two years onthejob experience, and usually a college degree.
arroyo_realty_manager  What you would be doing is more like advertising.

walter_white  I I wouldn't really know where to begin. I
walter_white  I mean God
walter_white  You have no idea.
walter_white  I spend my days just drawing out atoms on the chalkboard and trying to get these kids to learn the periodic table.
elliott_schwartz  Look, I understand.
elliott_schwartz  You're a little rusty, but you're not seeing the upside here.
elliott_schwartz  We could really benefit from a new set of eyes.
elliott_schwartz  You know what it is when you been trying to crack some problem for months on end. You get tunnel vision.
elliott_schwartz  One guy thinking outside of the box You may be exactly what we need.
walter_white  Well, listen, Elliott Your
walter_white  offer is very appealing. It really is. I thank you.
walter_white  But There's
walter_white  There's something you should know.
walter_white  I have some personal issues.
elliott_schwartz  Look, there's nothing we can't work out
walter_white  Well, yeah, but it's complicated.
elliott_schwartz  We can help you.

walter_white  What the hell did you say to Elliott?
walter_white  You told him about the cancer, didn't you?
walter_white  Didn't you?
walter_white  I can't believe it
skyler_white  Okay, we were talking. He asked how you were doing, and I am sorry, but I don't have the best poker face these days where that's concerned.
skyler_white  He knew something was wrong with you and he pressed me.
walter_white  He pressed you.
walter_white  Come on.
skyler_white  Walt! When it came right down to it, I didn't know what else to do but tell him the truth.
walter_white  The truth
walter_white  truth? How about you just said" he's fine," huh?
walter_white  Maybe you could've just have said that?
walter_white " He's fine,"
walter_white  and done. I don't like the way you're talking to me.
skyler_white  I
walter_white  I don't like the way you talk about my private affairs to people who are not even in our lives anymore.
skyler_white  What exactly did he say to you? He
walter_white  He offered me a job.
skyler_white  What? Yes
walter_white  Yes.
walter_white  Kind of like some fig leaf, you know?
walter_white  Some facesaving bullshit that allowed me to generously accept his charity.
walter_white  And then, when I turned that down, he flatout offered to pay for my treatment.
walter_white  Which is exactly what you expected him to do, didn't you?
walter_white  Didn't you?
skyler_white  No. Please
walter_white  Please. Come
walter_white  Come on. I
skyler_white  I did not put
walter_white  put him up
skyler_white  Okay, what did you say?

walter_white  What do you think I
walter_white  ready to go?
walter_white_jr.  I'm taking the bus.
skyler_white  Bye, honey.

louis_corbett  What about him?
soren  you kidding?
soren  He looks younger than us.
louis_corbett  Whatever.
louis_corbett  What about that guy
walter_white_jr.  Nah, he looks like a businessman. So
soren  So what? So
walter_white_jr.  So, businessmen are always in a hurry.
walter_white_jr.  They're always, like, going to some meeting or something.
walter_white_jr.  Seriously, he's just going to say no.
soren  This guy.
soren  This is our guy.
soren  You're up.
walter_white_jr.  Why do I have to do
soren  it? Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.
walter_white_jr.  Excuse me, hey. We forgot our IDs and we were wondering if you could do us a favor and buy us a sixpack.
off-duty_police_officer  You know, what you're asking is illegal.
walter_white_jr.  No, it's not?
off-duty_police_officer  Yeah, it is.
off-duty_police_officer  Guess you win the jackpot.
off-duty_police_officer  This is not how I wanted to spend my night off.
off-duty_police_officer  Consider this your first and last warning.
walter_white_jr.  Yes, sir.
off-duty_police_officer  You're lucky you got a good dad here.
walter_white_jr.  the other guys hadn't run,
walter_white_jr.  I could've talked my way out of it.
hank_schrader  Not cool, man. Not
hank_schrader  Not cool.
walter_white_jr.  What, you never tried to buy beer when you were my age?
hank_schrader  I'm talking about you calling me and not your father.
hank_schrader  that will make him feel?
walter_white  I don't even know what to say to you.
skyler_white  Just go.
skyler_white  I'll deal with you later.
hank_schrader  Where's Walt?
skyler_white  haven't seen him since this morning.
skyler_white  Your guess is as good as mine.
hank_schrader  Listen, do me a favor, all right?
hank_schrader  Don't tell him about the kid.
hank_schrader  Just a teenager trying to score some beer,
hank_schrader  You know. Just growing pains.
hank_schrader  he finds out his dad's sick, he starts acting out, you know?
hank_schrader  First the pot, and then this.
skyler_white  The pot?
hank_schrader  You told me he was smoking reefer.
marie_schrader  That's what Skyler told me. I
marie_schrader  I mean, you may as well have.
skyler_white  I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.
skyler_white  was talking about Walt.
marie_schrader  Excuse me?
skyler_white  He admitted it.
hank_schrader  he liked it. Walt? I didn't think he had it
skyler_white  It's like he's not himself lately.
hank_schrader  I
skyler_white  I mean, why would anyone in their right mind choose not to do treatment?
skyler_white  Especially when it's completely paid for?
skyler_white  is he doing this?
skyler_white  You know what we need to do?
skyler_white  What we really need to do is sit him down, all of us, and get everything out on the table.
skyler_white  Talk it all through.
marie_schrader  You mean an intervention?
skyler_white  No, no.
skyler_white  Just a family meeting
skyler_white  where everyone can voice their concerns and be heard.
badger  You are a genius, bro!
badger  This cankenstein is unreal!
badger  When we get back, I'm gonna burn that dollar bill suit 'cause we're gonna make some mad dough! It's not right
jesse_pinkman  What
badger  What do you mean it's not right?
jesse_pinkman  It's cloudy. It's
jesse_pinkman  It's not supposed to be cloudy.
jesse_pinkman  That last time, it was glass.
badger  So what? Cloudy
badger  Cloudy, not cloudy,
badger  it looks good enough to me.
badger  enough.
badger  Yo, what are you doing?
badger  Are you out of your mind? I totally would've smoked that!
jesse_pinkman  It's not for you, it's for our customers. They're
jesse_pinkman  They're gonna demand a certain standard.
badger  What
badger  What?
badger  What are you
badger  What?
jesse_pinkman  We'll just do it again
jesse_pinkman  until we get it right.
skyler_white  Please have a seat and join us.
jesse_pinkman  We can do better.
badger  Don't you fucking think about
badger  it! Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted! You
badger  You know how long I had to spin that stupid sign? Get off me, psycho! Helicopter, bitch! Open the door! Come back here,
jesse_pinkman  bitch! I'm gonna mess you up!
skyler_white  I really need to understand your thought process because clearly I don't.
skyler_white  I feel that this decision you've made is not only not in your best interest, it's not in the best interest of our entire family.
walter_white  Look, Skyler Not
skyler_white  Not yet. Please. I
skyler_white  I have the Talking
skyler_white  Everybody gets to speak their minds, remember?
skyler_white  And then, you'll get your chance.
skyler_white  Money has always been an issue for us, I'll give you that.
skyler_white  But now that Elliott is more than willing to pitch in,
skyler_white  I know, I understand that it's hard for you to accept help.
skyler_white  Maybe it's the way you were raised.
skyler_white  But, honey it's okay to lean on people now and again.
skyler_white  You need this treatment,
skyler_white  and nothing can stop you from getting it, except you.
walter_white  Am I allowed to respond?
skyler_white  In a minute.
skyler_white  I think we need to go around the circle first.
skyler_white  Hank, would you like to start?
hank_schrader  Okay. Well,
hank_schrader  what I'll say is
skyler_white  is No, take the Talking Pillow.
hank_schrader  All right, look, buddy. I know I don't get to tell you this enough, but I care about you a
hank_schrader  hell of a lot.
hank_schrader  This cancer thing
hank_schrader  Let's just Let's face it. You know, you were dealt a shit hand.
hank_schrader  But sometimes your luck can change.
hank_schrader  I mean, I can't tell you how many times I was, you know, I started with a shit hand and I ended up with a full house. Okay?
hank_schrader  I
hank_schrader  I mean, the key is, you gotta hang in there.
hank_schrader  Man, you gotta keep placing your bets. Keep placing your bets.
marie_schrader  what the hell are you saying?
skyler_white  Please, Marie, let him talk.
skyler_white  That's what we're here to do.
skyler_white  Please.
skyler_white  Go on,
hank_schrader  Hank. Right, well Look at it this way, okay?
hank_schrader  the bottom of the 9th. Bases are loaded. You're up.
hank_schrader  But you got a bum arm. Right?
hank_schrader  There's no frickin' way you're gonna hit a homer.
hank_schrader  So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat, or you can hold on to your pride and lose the game.
hank_schrader  Get what I'm saying?
hank_schrader  You got your pride, man.
hank_schrader  I get it. Okay?
hank_schrader  I get it.
hank_schrader  this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in,
hank_schrader  I'm with your old lady on this one.
hank_schrader  I say take the money and run
hank_schrader  Somebody want to take this thing?
skyler_white  Here. Yes, Walter Walter
skyler_white  Walter Jr., I'm sure you have about a million things to say, probably,
skyler_white  and now is your chance.
skyler_white  Just let it all out.
walter_white_jr.  This is bullshit.
walter_white  Hey, come on.
skyler_white  It's all right.
skyler_white  Tell
skyler_white  Tell your dad how you feel.
walter_white_jr.  I'm pissed off. Tell
skyler_white  Tell him.
walter_white_jr.  I'm pissed off,
walter_white_jr. 'cause you're
walter_white_jr.  you're being
walter_white_jr.  You're a pussy.
walter_white_jr.  You're, like, ready to give up.
walter_white_jr.  God. What if you gave up on me,
walter_white_jr.  This here? All the stuff I've been through, and you're scared of a little chemotherapy?
marie_schrader  Me, personally? I think you should do whatever you want to do.
skyler_white  What?
marie_schrader  You told us to be honest about our feelings.
marie_schrader  Walt's the one with cancer. It's his decision.
marie_schrader  It's not up to any of us.
skyler_white  Why in the hell would you do this?
marie_schrader  I
marie_schrader  wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt.
marie_schrader  But after sitting here and listening to you all talk about his future like he has no say in it.
skyler_white  He's not gonna have a future if he doesn't get treatment.
marie_schrader  I am a medical professional.
marie_schrader  I xray people in treatment every day.
marie_schrader  I see them every day,
marie_schrader  and you know what?
marie_schrader  Some of them are absolutely miserable.
skyler_white  Marie I'm
marie_schrader  I'm sorry, but it's true.
marie_schrader  And some of them don't wanna spend their last weeks or months being picked at by doctors.
marie_schrader  But they got talked into it by their families.
hank_schrader  Could I get the pillow back?
hank_schrader  I agree with Marie on
marie_schrader  on that.
skyler_white  What
hank_schrader  What? Maybe
hank_schrader  Maybe Walt wants to die like a man.
skyler_white  That's the whole
skyler_white  point of this.
skyler_white  So either help, or leave!
marie_schrader  Skyler, I just wanted to do you the courtesy of giving you my honest opinion.
skyler_white  You know, Marie, this is not debate club.
skyler_white  This is my husband's life.
marie_schrader  make one simple observation My husband's life we're talking
skyler_white  Come on. How dare you
walter_white_jr.  This is so stupid.
walter_white  All right, I've got the Talking Pillow now.
walter_white  We all, in this room, we love each other.
walter_white  We want what's best for each other, and I know that.
walter_white  I am very thankful for that.
walter_white  But what I want
walter_white  What I want, what I need, is a choice.
skyler_white  What does that mean?
walter_white  Sometimes, I feel like I never actually make any of my own. Choices, I mean.
walter_white  My entire life, it just seems I never you know, had a real say about any of it.
walter_white  Now this last one, cancer all I have left is how I choose to approach this.
skyler_white  Then make the right choice,
skyler_white  Walt. You're not the only one it affects.
skyler_white  What about your son?
skyler_white  Don't you wanna see your daughter grow up?
skyler_white  I just
walter_white  Of course, I do.
walter_white  Skyler, you've read the statistics.
walter_white  These doctors talking about surviving. One year, two years, like it's the only thing that matters.
walter_white  But what good is it, to just survive if I am too sick to work,
walter_white  to enjoy a meal,
walter_white  to make love?
walter_white  For what time I have left, I want to live in my own house.
walter_white  I want to sleep in my own bed.
walter_white  I don't wanna choke down 30 or 40 pills every single day, lose my hair, and lie around, too tired to get up and so nauseated that I can't even move my head.
walter_white  cleaning up after me?
walter_white  Me,
walter_white  some dead man, some artificially alive,
walter_white  just marking time?
walter_white  No.
walter_white  And that's how you would remember me.
walter_white  That's the worst part.
walter_white  So that is my thought process, Skyler.
walter_white  sorry.
walter_white  I just I choose not to do it.
skyler_white  right what
walter_white  I'll do the treatment.
walter_white  It's gonna be okay.
skyler_white  The lady from the billing office said they usually bill the insurance company directly,
skyler_white  but since our HMO is not paying for it, we can pay up front with a credit card.
skyler_white  And then Elliott will send a check.
walter_white  I will take care of it.
medical_technician  Walter White?
walter_white  Yes.
walter_white  Okay.
skyler_white  See you in a
walter_white  a minute
