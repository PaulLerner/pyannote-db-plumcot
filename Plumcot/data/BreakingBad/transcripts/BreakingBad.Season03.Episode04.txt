#unknown Ever try it? I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.
#unknown I party.
#unknown But But that stuff's really addictive, right? Not really.
#unknown It's just a media thing.
#unknown You know? What's it like? It's awesome.
#unknown Everything's maximum interesting.
#unknown You get these really cold and sharplike action dagger feelings.
#unknown It's awesome.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown What do you say? [door chime jingles] Have a nice day.
#unknown [Saul] Now, how does it feel? Does it hurt? Yeah, it's tight.
#unknown Okay, but is it painful? It's hard to breathe.
#unknown Well, you need your breathing.
#unknown Uh, well although let's not lose sight of the fact that you were the victim of a terrible accident, Antonio, so some discomfort is to be expected.
#unknown Let's go with that one.
#unknown Mucho gusto en conocerle, seÃ±ora.
#unknown La proxima vez, cashier's check, por favor.
#unknown Oh, and spread the word.
#unknown I'm building a classaction, flight 515.
#unknown Victims' families would be great, but I'll take anyone on he ground who suffered emotionally anxiety, sleeplessness, you get the picture.
#unknown Trouble? [Walt] Ted Beneke? You cannot be serious.
#unknown That guys is a joke.
#unknown [Skyler] You know what, Walt? You know what? You called my bluff.
#unknown I called your What does that even mean? You dared me to tell the police, and I couldn't do it, so you win.
#unknown If you want to stay in this house, fine, but we are not married anymore.
#unknown I told you that I was done cooking meth, Skyler.
#unknown [laughing] Oh, right.
#unknown I promised you that.
#unknown And so what? At least I didn't run off to go Jesus! I mean, everything that I did I did for this family.
#unknown Oh, yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.
#unknown Oh, and what is that supposed to mean? You don't like it? Then leave and take your drug money with you.
#unknown That's what you want.
#unknown [metallic grinding] Jesus.
#unknown Garbage disposal.
#unknown You think this will get me to move out? You can screw Ted.
#unknown You can screw the butcher, the mailman, whoever you want.
#unknown Screw them all.
#unknown I'm not going anywhere.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Suit yourself.
#unknown [door closes] Is this a good or bad thing? [clinking] You want me to suit myself? I'll suit myself to his face! It's a bad thing.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown Ahem.
#unknown Walter White to see Ted Beneke.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Beneke's on a conference call.
#unknown Mmhmm, okay.
#unknown I will wait.
#unknown It could be a while.
#unknown I have all the time in the world.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown [chuckles] Here we go.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Beneke's not available.
#unknown Ted? Come on.
#unknown Ted, I can see you.
#unknown I can see you standing right there in your office.
#unknown Now, come on.
#unknown Open the door.
#unknown Come on, let's talk.
#unknown I just want to talk.
#unknown That's all.
#unknown Come on, let's be men about this.
#unknown Huh? Okay? How about that? Aha.
#unknown Hey, Walt, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.
#unknown Oh, yes, you are.
#unknown So open the door.
#unknown You're damn right you are.
#unknown You're right in the middle.
#unknown Just open the door, and let's talk about it, okay? Open the door, Ted, right now.
#unknown All right, you don't want to be a man about it? Okay.
#unknown Plan B.
#unknown How do you like that? Plan B.
#unknown [grunting] Oh, dear God.
#unknown Plan B! Walt.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown What are you doing? I'm talking with Ted.
#unknown [grunting] Oh, Jesus.
#unknown Huh? Next time, you'll open the door.
#unknown Oh, damn it.
#unknown I'm just here to talk.
#unknown I just want to talk to him.
#unknown God.
#unknown Can I just talk? I just want to talk to him.
#unknown I'm just talk All right.
#unknown All right, all right, all right, I'm calm.
#unknown I'm calm.
#unknown Fuck.
#unknown [tires screech] Aah! Aah! What do you want? What do you want? Hey! Hey, come on.
#unknown What the hell is wrong with you? You act like you're the first guy this ever happened to.
#unknown I caught my second wife screwing my stepdad, okay? It's a cruel world, Walt.
#unknown Grow up.
#unknown I just wanted to talk to him.
#unknown Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.
#unknown Consider this an intervention.
#unknown You could have been arrested back there.
#unknown You understand.
#unknown I mean, speaking as your lawyer, I'm always looking for billable hours, but speaking as your business associate, I'm strongly advising that you get your shit together.
#unknown Just cool it with this Beneke guy, at least for now.
#unknown Okay? Let's talk shop because I think this is a great opportunity to channel some of that negative energy into something positive.
#unknown How did you know? Sorry? About Skyler.
#unknown About where to find me just now.
#unknown How did you know? That's just my meticulousness.
#unknown Don't bog down in detail, Walt.
#unknown The lesson here Did you bug my house? Yeah, but I didn't know it was your house, did I? You had moved out.
#unknown Besides, you basically told me to.
#unknown I told you to? You strongly hinted that I should.
#unknown You were worried about your wife, remember? You were concerned she might say something to the police.
#unknown What? No, no, that's not true.
#unknown When the hell did I say that? Let's not get lost in the who, what, and whens.
#unknown The point is we did our due diligence, and she didn't talk.
#unknown She kept quiet.
#unknown She stood by you, Walt, which, if you ask me, is the ironical silver lining here.
#unknown I mean, on the one hand, sure, she snuck off the reservation to get some dirty, damp, and deep.
#unknown On the other hand [grunting] You're fired! You're done! Good.
#unknown Oh, boohoo, I won't cook meth anymore.
#unknown You're a crybaby.
#unknown Who needs you? Hey, I'm unplugging the Web site, so no more money laundering.
#unknown How do you like that? I want those bugs out of my house today.
#unknown I want them out now! Oh, you just bought a $300 suit, psycho! [whispering] Door.
#unknown Great, drilled right into the stucco.
#unknown [Mike] Oh, a little bit of putty, you'll be fine.
#unknown Just make sure you get all of those things.
#unknown A, these things cost $800 apiece.
#unknown B, you're not that interesting.
#unknown So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.
#unknown Great line of work, by the way.
#unknown Real upstanding field.
#unknown Yep, well I enjoy it.
#unknown You're free to leave now.
#unknown Anytime.
#unknown You know, Walter, sometimes it doesn't hurt to have someone watching your back.
#unknown [Carmen] Mr.
#unknown White? Hi.
#unknown What's up? I can't begin to understand what you're going through, Walt, with all of your health concerns and the stresses you've been under.
#unknown Still, as educators, there are certain responsibilities we need to be meeting here to the school and to the students themselves.
#unknown Yeah, of course.
#unknown Is this a Wheaten terrier? Uh, Norfolk.
#unknown Norfolk? That's surprising.
#unknown Walt, could you come back over here and have a seat, please? Sure.
#unknown You've been absent a lot recently, and when you are here at school, there have been some behavioral questions, and frankly I'm concerned.
#unknown Hm.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Are you feeling okay? And do you think maybe I should call Skyler? Umnah.
#unknown Let's just keep this What? Hey! Walt, what's wrong with you? You know, look, you're the one who was talking about D.
#unknown C.
#unknown , okay? This is how you get there.
#unknown You answer the bell.
#unknown You pay your dues.
#unknown Besides, it's you know, it's a big deal to get picked for this.
#unknown El Paso's like the Super Bowl.
#unknown I could get killed crossing the street, okay? Whatever.
#unknown I want to go.
#unknown [whispers] What about last time? What about last time? [phone rings] Schrader.
#unknown Hey, Sheriff.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Blue, huh? Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Thing is, uh Thing is I'm supposed to be getting on a plane right now.
#unknown The stuff this guy had was blue.
#unknown You sure about that? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, I want to talk to him.
#unknown Taxi.
#unknown [honk honk] Hi.
#unknown Man, I'm sorry.
#unknown I needed to talk to you, but you weren't at your apartment.
#unknown No, I moved back home.
#unknown That's good, right? Yeah.
#unknown Yo, did you just get fired? No.
#unknown No, no, no, it's, uh more like a sabbatical.
#unknown Indefinite.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Uh So what's up? Uh, should we go somewhere? No.
#unknown This is fine.
#unknown So, um, I want an intro to your guy.
#unknown What guy? Your guy.
#unknown Your distribution guy, The guy Saul hooked you up with.
#unknown No, no, no, no, no.
#unknown Come on, Jesse.
#unknown I thought about it, and I want to.
#unknown It's the one thing I'm good at.
#unknown No, that is just not true.
#unknown You're good at a lot of things, son.
#unknown Like what? What about your sobriety? I told you.
#unknown I'm not using.
#unknown Ever.
#unknown I just want back into the business.
#unknown Well, I don't.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I know, and that's cool.
#unknown I'm not asking you to cook.
#unknown [unzips bag] What's this? In the end, I just went with two reflux condensers.
#unknown I didn't want to lose track of my Ph levels, but I did everything else just like you taught me.
#unknown Super careful in my amounts and watched the numbers every step of the way.
#unknown So what do you think? It's good, right? What in the hell is this? What? What? This.
#unknown This.
#unknown This is my product.
#unknown This is my formula.
#unknown This is mine.
#unknown Okay, it's our product, but yeah, I was going to cut you in.
#unknown You were going to cut me in? No, no, no.
#unknown I cut you in.
#unknown What the hell is your problem? All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.
#unknown Absolutely not.
#unknown Why? Because I am not going to lend my name to an inferior product.
#unknown I mean, look at the diameters here.
#unknown What did you use for reduction? Don't tell me.
#unknown Platinum dioxide, right? No.
#unknown Mercuryaluminum amalgam.
#unknown The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.
#unknown All right, well, you must've done it wrong, then.
#unknown Your color is all cloudy, so you were struggling with distillation, too.
#unknown Now, this is very shoddy work, Pinkman.
#unknown I'm actually embarrassed for you.
#unknown What? No way.
#unknown I gave out samples, and everyone said it was the bomb.
#unknown Oh, they said it was the bomb.
#unknown And who are they? I wonder.
#unknown Huh? A bunch of meth heads? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown They should know, right? Yeah, well, sorry.
#unknown I can't help you.
#unknown Fine, asswad.
#unknown You know what? I'll contact the guy myself.
#unknown Oh, yeah? Good luck with that because my guy is a pro, and he doesn't deal with junkies.
#unknown You know what? Eat me.
#unknown Anytime, loser.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey! Hey.
#unknown Hey! I can't believe it's only 4:00.
#unknown This day is dragging.
#unknown Mm.
#unknown [Skyler moaning] I wish I could stay.
#unknown So stay.
#unknown What's stopping you? [sighs] What? Like everything, you mean? How about my lunatic husband refusing to leave the house? Ahem.
#unknown So move in here.
#unknown And then my son hating me even more.
#unknown Nah.
#unknown It'll pass.
#unknown I went through that with the girls.
#unknown They adapt.
#unknown And now everyone at work thinks I'm an evil, ladderclimbing whore.
#unknown They're all fired effective immediately.
#unknown [laughs] What else? [both laugh] Oh, aren't you the answer man.
#unknown Where did it Where did it go wrong, exactly you and Walt? I mean, I always saw him as kind of mildmannered.
#unknown Something, I don't know, change when he got sick, or? I don't know what changed, Ted, and I just don't feel really comfortable talking about it.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Just asking out of selfinterest.
#unknown Got to make sure I don't make the same mistake.
#unknown I would be amazed.
#unknown Just let me see if I'm following you here, Russell.
#unknown You got this stuff from some guy at Gasparza's who was wearing tan pants and who you're 80% sure had a mustache.
#unknown That's it, right? That's your brain working at maximum capacity? [panting] Russell.
#unknown Everything all right in there? Mel.
#unknown The dude's name was Mel.
#unknown Well, there you go.
#unknown See? You served an actual earthly function.
#unknown I can't believe I remembered that.
#unknown Mel who? Does he have a last name? Yeah, uh, Mel.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Was it Mel? UmMark.
#unknown It was definitely an "M" name.
#unknown Oh, man, I'm losing it.
#unknown Wait, wait.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's gone.
#unknown It's gone.
#unknown It was an "M" name, though.
#unknown I remember the "muh" sound.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Huh? We'll go with the "muh" sound.
#unknown Thanks a lot.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Appreciate it.
#unknown He definitely had tan pants.
#unknown Remind me to get a vasectomy.
#unknown Okay, it's after 9, so this bar that Girl George is at, probably walltowall dirtbags by now.
#unknown Let's go have a little lookyloo, see if we can't find this Mnamed clown.
#unknown What? It's a lead.
#unknown Lead to what? To Heisenberg.
#unknown I told you it was only a matter of time before this guy booted up again.
#unknown Here we go, my friend.
#unknown Don't hate me because I'm beautiful, Gomie.
#unknown Just apologize and buy me a beer.
#unknown Man, you're reaching.
#unknown This stuff could be a knockoff or left over from an older cook.
#unknown How do you know Heisenberg's gearing up again? How do I know? Because I know.
#unknown I don't get it.
#unknown This is the reason why you're blowing off the task force? Chase down teeners? I'm getting tired of all the second guessing.
#unknown If you're not sufficiently stimulated by this investigation, do us both a favor and ask for a transfer.
#unknown What is up with you lately? Starting bar fights? Turning down El Paso? And now this bullshit? Do you need to talk to someone or what? Talk to someone? Talk to who? I'm not trying to step on your toes, bro.
#unknown Okay? I'm just worried about you.
#unknown That's all.
#unknown Appreciate thatbro.
#unknown Now take your hand off my shoulder.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.
#unknown Did any little piece fall on your property? I'm not looking for an entire wing here, Mr.
#unknown Linkas.
#unknown It could be a nut or a bolt.
#unknown It could be a bag of peanuts, just so long as it caused you pain and suffering.
#unknown Oh, no, no, no.
#unknown Closed.
#unknown Uh, calling you back.
#unknown You had your chance.
#unknown I told you to get him cooking again, and you blew it off, and now it's too late.
#unknown The guy's gone mass maniac on us! All I wanted was to show you two your potential, and what do I get in return? A bone contusion.
#unknown You want to see the scar? I wish you two had Hi, there.
#unknown How in the hell did you get Walt to I made it.
#unknown You know the guy who knows the guy, right? Uh, good news is, for a stage three cancer, the guy's doing well physically.
#unknown Mentally, the guy's a disaster.
#unknown He's gone off the rails over this thing with his wife.
#unknown My opinion, he's not coming back, not on his own.
#unknown Your friends were at his place again, by the way.
#unknown They drew something on the street outside his house.
#unknown The scythe.
#unknown Animals.
#unknown Does the lawyer know? Should he? No.
#unknown If you want this guy to produce again, why not just tell him? You're the only thing that stands between him and an ax in the head.
#unknown I don't believe fear to be an effective motivator.
#unknown I want investment.
#unknown For now, I'm simply interested in time frame.
#unknown He will live for the foreseeable future, yes? Mm, foreseeable, couple years at least, barring acts of G and men with axes.
#unknown Oh, from the lawyer, I'm supposed to let you know the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.
#unknown I don't work with junkies.
#unknown That's what I thought you'd say.
#unknown Probably for the best.
#unknown What I hear, he and Walter are splitsville.
#unknown Really? That's what Goodman says.
#unknown Cats and dogs.
#unknown Do the deal.
#unknown Mm.
#unknown Hm.
#unknown [Voice mail] You have one unheard message.
#unknown [Man] Agent Schrader, you need to be calling me back ASAP.
#unknown Clear? I've got Texas breathing down my neck, and I'm not about [beeps] [Woman] Yeah, I haven't see Matt Where can I find him, you think? No idea.
#unknown I haven't seen him I know.
#unknown You said that a few times.
#unknown Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
#unknown I don't know what else to say.
#unknown What's your name, darling? Cara.
#unknown Where did this come from, Cara? I I don't know.
#unknown What is it? Drugs? Look, I'm just going to come right out and say it.
#unknown Um, you're a bad liar, Cara.
#unknown Don't get me wrong.
#unknown Not the worst I've ever seen.
#unknown Once had a guy try to explain the dope balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.
#unknown Still, you're not a very good liar.
#unknown I honestly don't know Stop.
#unknown You look like a good kid.
#unknown I'm not here to get you in trouble, but you need to tell me where this came from right now! [gasping] I never do stuff like this.
#unknown I swear to God.
#unknown I tried it, and I hated it, so I just gave it to Matt.
#unknown Okay, and who gave it to you? Some guy, he came in a couple days ago and wanted to trade it for gas.
#unknown Some guy? WWhat's his name? Okay, w What did he look like? [weeping] I don't know.
#unknown Um He looked pretty normal.
#unknown You know? Um, white um I think his hair was lightish brown.
#unknown He had really blue eyes.
#unknown They were really, really blue.
#unknown He's dreamy.
#unknown Okay, wwwhat else? Piercings,ewelry, distinctive articles of clothing? Come on.
#unknown [whimpers] Come on.
#unknown Listen to me.
#unknown It's real important that I find the person that had these drugs, so if you can remember anything elsabout him Come on.
#unknown He drove an RV.
#unknown Okay, good, good.
#unknown What can you remember? What kind of RV? What color? Did you spot a license plate? I don't knot the kinds, and I didn't see the license, but the color was, I think, white, brownish color.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I know I'm not helping you, but Please don't tell my dad.
#unknown Cara.
#unknown Please tell me that that camera works.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown Bingo.
#unknown These eggs are good, Mom.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Hey, you know what's weird? Dad's Web site.
#unknown It's been three days since the last donation.
#unknown Yeah, well people lose interest.
#unknown Um So how long are you off for? A few weeks.
#unknown Uh, we'll play it by ear.
#unknown I probably pushed it, you know, going back to work so soon.
#unknown Think Think I can get a ride today? Louis has a doctor's appointment.
#unknown Uhyeah.
#unknown Hey, so Dad can babysit now.
#unknown Right? You won't have to take Holly to work every day.
#unknown Sometime, maybe.
#unknown We'll see.
#unknown What's up? I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown No.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Hey! Hey! Hey.
#unknown What the hell? This is only half.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown It's your half.
#unknown Yo! Where's the other half, bitch? I mean, it was, uh [chuckle] The whole thing was crazy, man.
#unknown Poor bastard.
#unknown I felt sorry for him.
#unknown He actually thought we were the cable guys, you know? Anyway, uh, um, sorry about those miscalls, Chief.
#unknown I'm changing providers.
#unknown It won't happen again.
#unknown Are you going to El Paso, Hank? Hell, yes! With pointed boots and bells on.
#unknown Just I got this break in the Heisenberg case.
#unknown The blue meth, you mean? The teenth? Yeah, well, that teenth got things rolling.
#unknown I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
#unknown That's where I got these.
#unknown Now, the station's, uh, closed circuit, uh, was down surprise, surprise but I was able to pull some of these snapshots off an ATM security camera.
#unknown Hey, now, I always thought these guys might be camper cooking, right? First off, your typical Class C motor home is going to grunt at least 5,000 pounds of interior fixtures, okay? We're talking appliances, furniture, builtins.
#unknown See how high that suspension's riding? No way, no how, this thing's carrying that kind of weight.
#unknown I mean, this thing has been cleared out and stripped down to its tight and curlies.
#unknown For what? Blood bank? Maybe a bookmobile? There's no clear view of the plates.
#unknown Yeah, well, you can only get so lucky, right? But the fact that there's no front plate tells me its likely New Mexico registration.
#unknown I checked with DMV.
#unknown There are only 29 of these early '80s Bounders registered in the state.
#unknown Only 29? Yeah.
#unknown So I got to go, uh, you know, knock on some doors.
#unknown They need you in El Paso, Hank.
#unknown You bet.
#unknown I I I'm just going to wrap up this Heisenberg thing first.
#unknown So you're refusing the assignment.
#unknown No, I'm not.
#unknown I'll go.
#unknown It's just I need some more time.
#unknown You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.
#unknown You're out of time.
#unknown Are you going to El Paso now? Tonight? Just a simple yes or no.
#unknown No.
#unknown I can't.
#unknown But that's only because I'm really close to something big here.
#unknown Better get to it, then.
#unknown [Announcer] This is KECA 480, Albuquerque news radio.
#unknown KECA news time 10:13.
#unknown Our top story this hour Donald Margolis, the air traffic controller criticized for his role in the recent air disaster in which 167 persons died, was rushed to an area hospital early this morning, apparently the victim of a selfinflicted gunshot wound.
