christian_"combo"_ortega  Go!
dr._delcavoli  Well, Walt, we've made such headway with your treatments that now it's time we talked about sealing the deal.
walter_white  Absolutely.
dr._delcavoli  As you know my initial diagnosis was that your cancer was inoperable.
dr._delcavoli  That may no longer be the case.
dr._delcavoli  We think now that a lobectomy may be a viable option.
dr._victor_bravenec  Maybe a pretty good option.
dr._delcavoli  Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons in the country performing lobectomies after fulldosage radiation.
dr._delcavoli  He's got a good track record.
dr._victor_bravenec  Pretty good.
skyler_white  It sounds aggressive.
dr._delcavoli  Yes. Very
dr._delcavoli  Very much so.
dr._victor_bravenec  Understand that if you don't have this surgery you're just waiting for the cancer to spread.
dr._victor_bravenec  And it will.
dr._victor_bravenec  Through the treatment you've had, we've bought you some time.
dr._victor_bravenec  Maybe a lot, probably a little but that's all.
dr._victor_bravenec  In my opinion if you're willing to take some risk then this offers the best chance.
walter_white  How much would it cost? I
walter_white  I mean, I'm not on your insurance.
dr._victor_bravenec  I'd say between 170 and 200,000, all in.
dr._victor_bravenec  For my part, I'd be willing to write off what I can but mine isn't even the biggest expense.
dr._delcavoli  This is obviously a big decision and you folks are gonna wanna take some time to discuss it
walter_white  No.
walter_white  I'll do it.
skyler_white  Walt, don't you think we should at least talk this through first
walter_white  I just think it's the way to go.
dr._delcavoli  I have to say, I think it's the right choice.
dr._victor_bravenec  I recommend that we let the pneumonitis heal for another couple of weeks and then we'll have at it
walter_white  That's tricky.
dr._victor_bravenec  When's the due date
skyler_white  It's the 21st.
dr._victor_bravenec  So two weeks and change?
dr._victor_bravenec  I'll book the surgery for four weeks from now.
dr._victor_bravenec  That way Walter can be on his feet for the birth of your daughter.
dr._victor_bravenec  But I wouldn't wait any longer.
walter_white  Where
walter_white  the hell
walter_white  like,
jesse_pinkman  Working
walter_white  Working.
walter_white  What is it?
jesse_pinkman  Combo's dead.
walter_white  Which one is he?
jesse_pinkman  did not just say that to me.
walter_white  Jesse, listen
jesse_pinkman  That figures.
jesse_pinkman  the word on the street?
skinny_pete  No one's dropping no names.
skinny_pete  Combo rang me before it went down, said dudes were maddogging him trying to run him up off the corner.
skinny_pete  That's all I know.
skinny_pete  Why'd we have to go pushing into new turf, yo?
skinny_pete  I mean what'd you expect?
jesse_pinkman  You
skinny_pete  don't know?
skinny_pete  all you got?
jesse_pinkman  do right by Combo's people.
jesse_pinkman  But make sure you bust up your cell and toss it, all right?
jesse_pinkman  We'll figure it out
skinny_pete  appreciate what you're saying and all but with Combo gone and Badger laying low out in Cali.
skinny_pete  I'm on probation, man.
skinny_pete  Fast track to Los Lunas.
jesse_pinkman  We're on the verge of making some serious coin, Skinny.
jesse_pinkman  What, you're gonna jump ship now?
skinny_pete  This game we playing?
skinny_pete  We don't got the street cred to survive it.
skinny_pete  Back when everyone thought you killed Spooge maybe we were doing okay, but that whole thing to the head thing, the ATM?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah? His
skinny_pete  junkie bitch copped to it.
skinny_pete  Whole town knows it wasn't you.
jesse_pinkman  Everyone knows?
jesse_pinkman  you say something?
skinny_pete  I don't know, man.
skinny_pete  Because we like you and all.
jesse_pinkman  I'm telling you, just sit tight.
jesse_pinkman  We'll get by.
jesse_pinkman  All right? We'll make it.
skinny_pete  Sorry, Jesse.
walter_white  We have had a bit of a setback.
walter_white  That's an accurate description.
walter_white  What else do you want me to call it? How
jesse_pinkman  How about" your fault"
walter_white  No, no, don't lay that on me. You
walter_white  You are in charge of distribution
jesse_pinkman  distribution. You said expand the territory.
walter_white  Doesn't mean you become careless. Guys, guys! Hey!
saul_goodman  Do
saul_goodman  Do I look like Maury Povich?
saul_goodman  I'm not your marriage counsellor.
saul_goodman  Now, you're professionals.
saul_goodman  Act like it.
saul_goodman  Now, setback.
saul_goodman  Go.
walter_white  One of our dealers was murdered.
walter_white  was some kind of turf dispute and apparently we lost.
walter_white  And then everyone quit on us.
walter_white  I mean, we have absolutely no distribution.
saul_goodman  Is there any way any of this can be traced back to you?
saul_goodman  Now, the police, I'm talking about.
saul_goodman  Well, there's your silver lining.
saul_goodman  How about you? How's
saul_goodman  How's the health situation?
walter_white  It's better.
walter_white  Do you mind?
saul_goodman  Better?
walter_white  Yeah, it's Iooking a little more positive.
walter_white  I may have more time than I thought.
saul_goodman  Outstanding.
saul_goodman  Now, as to your dead guy :
saul_goodman  occupational hazard.
saul_goodman  Drug dealer getting shot? I'm
saul_goodman  I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it's been known to happen.
saul_goodman  Now, what about product on hand?
saul_goodman  How's your inventory?
jesse_pinkman  Thirtyeight and change.
saul_goodman  Thirtyeight ounces?
saul_goodman  Grams?
jesse_pinkman  Pounds
walter_white  You did say make hay while the sun is
saul_goodman  shining.
saul_goodman  Why the long faces here?
saul_goodman  You're sitting on a gold mine.
walter_white  A gold mine we can't sell.
walter_white  We need a proper infrastructure.
walter_white  We need foot soldiers and we need dealers on a street level that are rock solid.
walter_white  We need muscle and we need enforcers.
walter_white  Payback. That's
walter_white  That's what we need.
walter_white  this entire process has just been so.
walter_white  always been one step forward and two steps back.
walter_white  We need your help.
saul_goodman  Look, let's start with some tough love, all right?
saul_goodman  Ready for this?
saul_goodman  Here goes.
saul_goodman  You two suck at peddling meth.
saul_goodman  Period.
saul_goodman  So give up on trying to do it all yourselves.
saul_goodman  Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.
walter_white  Look, we are not going to deal with another highlevel distributor.
walter_white  No, thank you. We
walter_white  We have been down that road.
saul_goodman  What, some tattooed speed freak? No
saul_goodman  What you two need is an honesttoGod businessman. Somebody
saul_goodman  Somebody who treats your product Iike the simple highmargin commodity that it is.
saul_goodman  Somebody who ships out of town, deals only in bulk.
saul_goodman  Someone who's been doing this for 20 years and never been caught.
walter_white  You know someone like that?
saul_goodman  Let's just say I know a guy who knows a guy.
saul_goodman  Who knows another guy.
saul_goodman  Let me make some calls, see if I can get you a meeting.
walter_white  Well, what's his name?
saul_goodman  I have no idea.
saul_goodman  He's very low profile.
saul_goodman  He's careful like that.
saul_goodman  You know, from what I do hear about him he sounds a little like you.
unknown  And
jesse_pinkman  lands it. He's coming to the end and he's got the big fist pump. Now Mueller's coming. Oh, a double! Here he comes.
jesse_pinkman  leave. Look, there's some stuff about me you don't know and.
jane_margolis  Like you're a drug dealer?
jane_margolis  I kind of got that.
jane_margolis  You pay in cash and you use an alias, so.
jesse_pinkman  One of my guys a friend who worked for me got murdered.
jesse_pinkman  was my fault. I
jesse_pinkman  I put him on that corner.
jesse_pinkman  I'm gonna smoke some crystal and I just think you should go being that you're in a programme and all and.
jane_margolis  You could come with me to a meeting.
jesse_pinkman  No.
jesse_pinkman  No meetings.
jane_margolis  We could just get out of here.

jesse_pinkman  dude's name?
jesse_pinkman  So let me get this straight.
jesse_pinkman  He's allowed to know all our names what we look like, but not the other way around?
walter_white  Why don't you get yourself some food
jesse_pinkman  So we won't both sit here with our Happy Meals Iooking like a couple chumps?
gustavo_fring  Gentlemen, is everything to your satisfaction?
jesse_pinkman  Fine

ob-gyn_#2  You're on the low side of normal.
skyler_white  What? How low?

ob-gyn_#2  It's time to make a decision.
ob-gyn_#2  You know what I'm gonna say. The
skyler_white  Csection?
ob-gyn_#2  And if it's a yes, we need to schedule it
skyler_white  Well, my last labour was pretty tough, so.
skyler_white  For the baby, I say yes.
ob-gyn_#2  I agree, considering that your fluids are on the low side.
ob-gyn_#2  It's best we take her a little early.

walter_white  Yes, I'm positive.
walter_white  Where was he?
saul_goodman  Who

saul_goodman  I told you, he's very cautious who he does business with, all right?
saul_goodman  He's skittish, like a deer.
walter_white  Call him back.
saul_goodman  I can't
saul_goodman  do that.
walter_white  Yes, you can.
walter_white  Call him, Saul.
saul_goodman  First of all, I never called him, all right? I
saul_goodman  I called a guy who called a guy who called a guy.

gustavo_fring  Lucy, you must remember to
gustavo_fring  and pepper shakers wiped. Can I help you, sir?
walter_white  Diet Coke, please.
walter_white  And five minutes of your time.
gustavo_fring  What can I do for you?
walter_white  Have a seat.
walter_white  Please.
walter_white  I would like to know why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.
gustavo_fring  I'm sorry. I'm
gustavo_fring  I'm not following.
walter_white  I sat here yesterday, waiting to meet with someone.
walter_white  I believe that person was you.
gustavo_fring  I think that you're confusing me for someone else
walter_white  I don't think I am.
gustavo_fring  Sir, if you have a complaint I suggest you submit it through our email system.
gustavo_fring  I would be happy to refer you to our website.
walter_white  I was told that the man I would be meeting with is very careful.
walter_white  cautious man.
walter_white  I believe we're alike in that way.
walter_white  If you are who I think you are you should give me another chance.
gustavo_fring  I don't think we're alike at all, Mr.
gustavo_fring  You are not a cautious man at all.
gustavo_fring  Your partner was late and he was high
walter_white  Yes, he was.
gustavo_fring  He's high often, isn't he?
gustavo_fring  You have poor judgement.
gustavo_fring  I can't work with someone with poor judgement. Are
walter_white  Are you familiar with my product?
gustavo_fring  I've been told it's
walter_white  it's excellent. lt is impeccable.
walter_white  It is the purest most chemically sound product on the market anywhere.
gustavo_fring  That is not the only factor.
walter_white  You could charge twice the current rate for what I provide and your customers would pay it.
walter_white  Hands down.
walter_white  Now, who I choose to do business with on my end is not your problem.
walter_white  You won't see him.
walter_white  You won't interact with him.
walter_white  Forget he exists.
gustavo_fring  I have to ask.
gustavo_fring  Why?
gustavo_fring  Why him?
walter_white  Because he does what I
walter_white  Because I can trust him.
gustavo_fring  How much product do you have on hand?
walter_white  Ready
walter_white  Ready to go at a moment's notice.
walter_white  Will I hear from you?
gustavo_fring  have your numbers.
gustavo_fring  You can never trust a drug addict.
skyler_white  Look, I mean, it's all kind of little dribs and drabs but right here, take Keller, for instance.
skyler_white  couple hundred dollars here, a few thousand there.
ted_beneke  Dribs and drabs.
skyler_white  you add it all up, though, with Keller the revenues are almost 10 percent less than was actually received.
skyler_white  And this is every quarter for the last two years.
skyler_white  When I saw that, I got worried so I checked Accounts Receivable. I
skyler_white  I found six other instances of revenues being underreported.
skyler_white  And I've only just started to look into it.
ted_beneke  We have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies.
ted_beneke  They anticipate their needs for the next quarter.
ted_beneke  Most of the time, they overestimate.
ted_beneke  I let them roll their overages into the next order and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.
ted_beneke  Obviously, we forgot or didn't go back and adjust the revenue entries.
ted_beneke  I know it's wrong from an accounting standpoint, but as you can see the money's coming in eventually, as you can see.
skyler_white  Right but I got the old bills of sale and order forms out of storage to try and sort this out.
skyler_white  Most of the time, there's no backup for the reported revenues at all
skyler_white  In a few cases I found xeroxed copies with the dates changed.
ted_beneke  You
ted_beneke  You got me.
skyler_white  We're talking nearly a million dollars of undocumented revenue.
skyler_white  you thinking? I'm
ted_beneke  thinking about saving a company.
ted_beneke  I'm thinking about people's jobs about their mortgages and pensions and their college funds for their kids.
ted_beneke  Not to mention my own.
skyler_white  doesn't mean that you have to break the law. Yes
ted_beneke  Yes, it does, Skyler.
ted_beneke  It's in the books.
ted_beneke  Business is terrible.
ted_beneke  The bank is on my back, the lRS is grinding me down to a nub.
ted_beneke  lf I don't keep up Ted
skyler_white  Ted.
ted_beneke  this. My dad built this company from nothing.
ted_beneke  We make things here.
ted_beneke  The people who work here are like family.
ted_beneke  can't let that all fall apart because of a couple of bad years.
ted_beneke  Sky don't report this
ted_beneke  Please.
skyler_white  I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.
skyler_white  But I can't be a part of it
ted_beneke  know.
ted_beneke  I just wish.
ted_beneke  I'm sorry.
ted_beneke  I don't want you to go.
skinny_pete  Yo, if I know you, leave a message. Yo, it's Skinny Pete. Just
skinny_pete  Just checking in with you, man.

pollos_manager  He could be at any one of them
walter_white  Is there a phone number that I can get to?
pollos_manager  I'm sorry, sir.
pollos_manager  I can't give that out.
pollos_manager  Is this about a complaint? I'd
pollos_manager  I'd be happy to refer you to our website.
