#unknown What's up? How's it going? All right.
#unknown What you need? You buying or you just stopping to envy? Yeah.
#unknown Punk bitches.
#unknown Please leave your message for 5051275223.
#unknown Record your message after the tone.
#unknown To send a numeric page Bounce, little man.
#unknown Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine, getting eyeballed hard.
#unknown I got a bad feeling, man.
#unknown I need some backup.
#unknown Get your ass up here now.
#unknown What's that thing in your ear? What did I say? Get out of here! What are you waiting for? Go! Well, Walt, we've made such headway with your treatments that now it's time we talked about sealing the deal.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown As you know my initial diagnosis was that your cancer was inoperable.
#unknown That may no longer be the case.
#unknown We think now that a lobectomy may be a viable option.
#unknown Maybe a pretty good option.
#unknown Dr.
#unknown Bravenec is one of the few surgeons in the country performing lobectomies after fulldosage radiation.
#unknown He's got a good track record.
#unknown Pretty good.
#unknown It sounds aggressive.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Very much so.
#unknown Understand that if you don't have this surgery you're just waiting for the cancer to spread.
#unknown And it will.
#unknown Through the treatment you've had, we've bought you some time.
#unknown Maybe a lot, probably a little but that's all.
#unknown In my opinion if you're willing to take some risk then this offers the best chance.
#unknown How much would it cost? I mean, I'm not on your insurance.
#unknown I'd say between 170 and 200,000, all in.
#unknown For my part, I'd be willing to write off what I can but mine isn't even the biggest expense.
#unknown This is obviously a big decision and you folks are gonna wanna take some time to discuss it.
#unknown No.
#unknown I'll do it.
#unknown Walt, don't you think we should at least talk this through first? I just think it's the way to go.
#unknown I have to say, I think it's the right choice.
#unknown I recommend that we let the pneumonitis heal for another couple of weeks and then we'll have at it.
#unknown That's tricky.
#unknown When's the due date? It's the 21st.
#unknown So two weeks and change? I'll book the surgery for four weeks from now.
#unknown That way Walter can be on his feet for the birth of your daughter.
#unknown But I wouldn't wait any longer.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Fourteen messages.
#unknown God.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's me.
#unknown Where the hell were you? I called, like, 20 times.
#unknown Working.
#unknown What is it? Combo's dead.
#unknown Shot.
#unknown Which one is he? You did not just say that to me.
#unknown Jesse, listen That figures.
#unknown What's the word on the street? No one's dropping no names.
#unknown Combo rang me before it went down, said dudes were maddogging him trying to run him up off the corner.
#unknown That's all I know.
#unknown Why'd we have to go pushing into new turf, yo? I mean what'd you expect? I don't know.
#unknown You don't know? Is that all you got? I'll do right by Combo's people.
#unknown But make sure you bust up your cell and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.
#unknown I appreciate what you're saying and all but with Combo gone and Badger laying low out in Cali.
#unknown I'm on probation, man.
#unknown Fast track to Los Lunas.
#unknown We're on the verge of making some serious coin, Skinny.
#unknown What, you're gonna jump ship now? This game we playing? We don't got the street cred to survive it.
#unknown Back when everyone thought you killed Spooge maybe we were doing okay, but that whole thing to the head thing, the ATM? Yeah? His junkie bitch copped to it.
#unknown Whole town knows it wasn't you.
#unknown Everyone knows? Why didn't you say something? I don't know, man.
#unknown Because we like you and all.
#unknown I'm telling you, just sit tight.
#unknown We'll get by.
#unknown All right? We'll make it.
#unknown Sorry, Jesse.
#unknown I'm out.
#unknown We have had a bit of a setback.
#unknown That's an accurate description.
#unknown What else do you want me to call it? How about "your fault"? No, no, don't lay that on me.
#unknown You are in charge of distribution.
#unknown You said expand the territory.
#unknown Doesn't mean you become careless.
#unknown Guys, guys! Hey! Do I look like Maury Povich? I'm not your marriage counsellor.
#unknown Now, you're professionals.
#unknown Act like it.
#unknown Now, setback.
#unknown Go.
#unknown One of our dealers was murdered.
#unknown It was some kind of turf dispute and apparently we lost.
#unknown And then everyone quit on us.
#unknown I mean, we have absolutely no distribution.
#unknown Is there any way any of this can be traced back to you? Now, the police, I'm talking about.
#unknown Well, there's your silver lining.
#unknown How about you? How's the health situation? It's better.
#unknown Do you mind? Better? Yeah, it's Iooking a little more positive.
#unknown I may have more time than I thought.
#unknown Outstanding.
#unknown Now, as to your dead guy: occupational hazard.
#unknown Drug dealer getting shot? I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it's been known to happen.
#unknown Now, what about product on hand? How's your inventory? Thirtyeight and change.
#unknown Thirtyeight ounces? Grams? Pounds.
#unknown You did say make hay while the sun is shining.
#unknown Guys! Why the long faces here? You're sitting on a gold mine.
#unknown A gold mine we can't sell.
#unknown We need a proper infrastructure.
#unknown We need foot soldiers and we need dealers on a street level that are rock solid.
#unknown We need muscle and we need enforcers.
#unknown Payback.
#unknown That's what we need.
#unknown God.
#unknown I mean, this entire process has just been so.
#unknown It's always been one step forward and two steps back.
#unknown We need your help.
#unknown Look, let's start with some tough love, all right? Ready for this? Here goes.
#unknown You two suck at peddling meth.
#unknown Period.
#unknown So give up on trying to do it all yourselves.
#unknown Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.
#unknown Look, we are not going to deal with another highlevel distributor.
#unknown No, thank you.
#unknown We have been down that road.
#unknown What, some tattooed speed freak? No.
#unknown What you two need is an honesttoGod businessman.
#unknown Somebody who treats your product Iike the simple highmargin commodity that it is.
#unknown Somebody who ships out of town, deals only in bulk.
#unknown Someone who's been doing this for 20 years and never been caught.
#unknown You know someone like that? Let's just say I know a guy who knows a guy.
#unknown Who knows another guy.
#unknown Let me make some calls, see if I can get you a meeting.
#unknown Well, what's his name? I have no idea.
#unknown He's very low profile.
#unknown He's careful like that.
#unknown You know, from what I do hear about him he sounds a little like you.
#unknown And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.
#unknown He's coming to the end and he's got the big fist pump.
#unknown Now Mueller's coming.
#unknown Oh, a double! Here he comes.
#unknown And he's coming to the end and he takes second.
#unknown I need you to leave.
#unknown Look, there's some stuff about me you don't know and.
#unknown Like you're a drug dealer? I kind of got that.
#unknown You pay in cash and you use an alias, so.
#unknown One of my guys a friend who worked for me got murdered.
#unknown It was my fault.
#unknown I put him on that corner.
#unknown I'm gonna smoke some crystal and I just think you should go being that you're in a programme and all and.
#unknown You could come with me to a meeting.
#unknown No.
#unknown No meetings.
#unknown We could just get out of here.
#unknown lt won't help.
#unknown Yeah, it will.
#unknown And I don't need you telling me that it won't.
#unknown I just.
#unknown All right, I really just need you to go.
#unknown Sir? Enjoy your meal.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You're late.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown We're in the big time now.
#unknown So where's the kingpin? Your guess is as good as mine.
#unknown So you get the dude's name? Nope.
#unknown So let me get this straight.
#unknown He's allowed to know all our names what we look like, but not the other way around? Why don't you get yourself some food? So we won't both sit here with our Happy Meals Iooking like a couple chumps? Gentlemen, is everything to your satisfaction? Fine, thanks.
#unknown This is nothing but an anklegrab.
#unknown I don't get you, man.
#unknown A week ago you talked like you were all ready to hang it up.
#unknown We've nearly got 40 pounds we still need to sell.
#unknown Yeah, what about after? After you gonna make up some new magic number? Like, "l got bills.
#unknown I got bills.
#unknown I gotta make more.
#unknown " What do you want me to say, Jesse? Things have changed.
#unknown Oh, I know.
#unknown We got a guy killed.
#unknown You know what? This is bullshit.
#unknown I'm out of here.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I think she's waking up from a nap.
#unknown She is certainly gonna wanna get out and stretch those legs soon.
#unknown We have to keep an eye on your fluids.
#unknown You're on the low side of normal.
#unknown What? How low? It's not a problem unless we see a growth dropoff, so we're good.
#unknown We'll have you in for an ultrasound next week and keep an eye on things.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Oh, man, you would not believe the traffic.
#unknown That's why I left 40 minutes early.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown What did I miss? For your refrigerator.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Look at her.
#unknown Look.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown God.
#unknown It's like she's here already.
#unknown I was just telling Skyler everything looks great.
#unknown Okay, we've been talking about it for months now.
#unknown It's time to make a decision.
#unknown You know what I'm gonna say.
#unknown The Csection? And if it's a yes, we need to schedule it.
#unknown Well, my last labour was pretty tough, so.
#unknown For the baby, I say yes.
#unknown I agree, considering that your fluids are on the low side.
#unknown It's best we take her a little early.
#unknown So why don't we schedule it for a week from Friday? Isn't that a Friday the 13th? We have a birthday.
#unknown The 16th.
#unknown I like it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You know, speaking of birthdays I've got to run back to the office, so I will see you later? It's an hour before closing.
#unknown You're supposed to be taking it easy.
#unknown We're having a gettogether for Ted's birthday and I've gotta pick up the cake.
#unknown Why you? Because I said I would? It is the least I can do.
#unknown Okay? Yeah, okay.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Let's get out of here.
#unknown You know, go do something.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown You know that museum in Santa Fe you talked about? Let's take a drive.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown No, I cannot return that stock.
#unknown It's been drilled, it's been cut.
#unknown We're halfway through the job.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Beneke to the shop, please.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Beneke to the shop.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Just let me think about it, okay? I gotta go.
#unknown Dean, I gotta go.
#unknown Okay, all right.
#unknown Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Oh, my God.
#unknown This is beautiful, guys.
#unknown Thank you very much.
#unknown Hurry.
#unknown These candles aren't gonna hold out much longer.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown You making a wish? You gotta make a wish.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, let's see.
#unknown The economy's in the toilet.
#unknown China's undercutting us at every turn.
#unknown I'm at a loss.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Skyler? Yes? I wanna hear it first.
#unknown Absolutely not.
#unknown No way.
#unknown You cannot deny your employer his birthday wish.
#unknown Yes, I can.
#unknown Watch me.
#unknown Please! If this is your birthday wish, I feel very, very sorry for you.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown It was so good last time.
#unknown lt was ages ago.
#unknown And I'm enormous now.
#unknown And I don't look anything like her anymore.
#unknown Not that I ever did.
#unknown I mean, come on.
#unknown These candles are getting wax all over the place.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown Yes, come on, Skyler.
#unknown Skyler, Skyler, Skyler.
#unknown It's obscene.
#unknown Skyler, Skyler, Skyler.
#unknown Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, Mr.
#unknown President Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated Happy birthday To you That was fantastic.
#unknown Isn't she great, huh? Okay, here we go.
#unknown He wasn't there.
#unknown Oh, he was there, all right.
#unknown What are you talking about? I sat there for two hours.
#unknown Nobody came.
#unknown All I know is my contact said he was there.
#unknown Are you sure you were at the right restaurant? Yes, I'm positive.
#unknown Where was he? Who knows? Maybe he checked you out with a telephoto lens didn't like the cut of your jib.
#unknown Anyway, it doesn't matter now because my contact says it's a nogo.
#unknown What? What do you mean? No deal.
#unknown No dice.
#unknown Shot at and missed.
#unknown Shit on and hit.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown How can he make that decision without even meeting me? I told you, he's very cautious who he does business with, all right? He's skittish, like a deer.
#unknown Call him back.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I can't do that.
#unknown Yes, you can.
#unknown Call him, Saul.
#unknown First of all, I never called him, all right? I called a guy who called a guy who called a guy.
#unknown Second of all, it's over.
#unknown Understand? With this particular individual all you get is the one shot.
#unknown Look I'll see if I can scrape something else together but don't get your hopes up.
#unknown No one else handles that kind of bulk.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown Lucy, you must remember to have the salt and pepper shakers wiped.
#unknown Can I help you, sir? Diet Coke, please.
#unknown And five minutes of your time.
#unknown What can I do for you? Have a seat.
#unknown Please.
#unknown I would like to know why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I'm not following.
#unknown I sat here yesterday, waiting to meet with someone.
#unknown I believe that person was you.
#unknown I think that you're confusing me for someone else.
#unknown I don't think I am.
#unknown Sir, if you have a complaint I suggest you submit it through our email system.
#unknown I would be happy to refer you to our website.
#unknown I was told that the man I would be meeting with is very careful.
#unknown A cautious man.
#unknown I believe we're alike in that way.
#unknown If you are who I think you are you should give me another chance.
#unknown I don't think we're alike at all, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown You are not a cautious man at all.
#unknown Your partner was late and he was high.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes, he was.
#unknown He's high often, isn't he? You have poor judgement.
#unknown I can't work with someone with poor judgement.
#unknown Are you familiar with my product? I've been told it's excellent.
#unknown lt is impeccable.
#unknown It is the purest most chemically sound product on the market anywhere.
#unknown That is not the only factor.
#unknown You could charge twice the current rate for what I provide and your customers would pay it.
#unknown Hands down.
#unknown Now, who I choose to do business with on my end is not your problem.
#unknown You won't see him.
#unknown You won't interact with him.
#unknown Forget he exists.
#unknown I have to ask.
#unknown Why? Why him? Because he does what I say.
#unknown Because I can trust him.
#unknown How much product do you have on hand? Thirtyeight pounds.
#unknown Ready to go at a moment's notice.
#unknown Will I hear from you? I have your numbers.
#unknown You can never trust a drug addict.
#unknown Look, I mean, it's all kind of little dribs and drabs but right here, take Keller, for instance.
#unknown A couple hundred dollars here, a few thousand there.
#unknown Dribs and drabs.
#unknown Once you add it all up, though, with Keller the revenues are almost 10 percent less than was actually received.
#unknown And this is every quarter for the last two years.
#unknown When I saw that, I got worried so I checked Accounts Receivable.
#unknown I found six other instances of revenues being underreported.
#unknown And I've only just started to look into it.
#unknown We have requirement contracts with a lot of these companies.
#unknown They anticipate their needs for the next quarter.
#unknown Most of the time, they overestimate.
#unknown I let them roll their overages into the next order and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.
#unknown Obviously, we forgot or didn't go back and adjust the revenue entries.
#unknown I know it's wrong from an accounting standpoint, but as you can see the money's coming in eventually, as you can see.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Right but I got the old bills of sale and order forms out of storage to try and sort this out.
#unknown Most of the time, there's no backup for the reported revenues at all.
#unknown In a few cases I found xeroxed copies with the dates changed.
#unknown Ted.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You got me.
#unknown We're talking nearly a million dollars of undocumented revenue.
#unknown What are you thinking? I'm thinking about saving a company.
#unknown I'm thinking about people's jobs about their mortgages and pensions and their college funds for their kids.
#unknown Not to mention my own.
#unknown It doesn't mean that you have to break the law.
#unknown Yes, it does, Skyler.
#unknown It's in the books.
#unknown Business is terrible.
#unknown The bank is on my back, the lRS is grinding me down to a nub.
#unknown lf I don't keep up Ted.
#unknown People go to prison for this.
#unknown My dad built this company from nothing.
#unknown We make things here.
#unknown The people who work here are like family.
#unknown I can't let that all fall apart because of a couple of bad years.
#unknown Sky don't report this.
#unknown Please.
#unknown I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.
#unknown But I can't be a part of it.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I just wish.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I don't want you to go.
#unknown Yo, if I know you, leave a message.
#unknown Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
#unknown Just checking in with you, man.
#unknown We missed you at the funeral today.
#unknown The whole crew was representing.
#unknown Even Badger came all the way from Fresno.
#unknown Combo's people, his ma, grandma, cousins everyone was all choked up and shit.
#unknown Man, it was, like, emotional.
#unknown And you should have seen the coffin.
#unknown It was this shiny white pearlescent.
#unknown I'm sure I've seen the exact same paint job on a Lexus.
#unknown So we're definitely talking highend.
#unknown Anyway, guess you had something bigger going down.
#unknown Watch your back out there, bro.
#unknown Peace.
#unknown I like to mix some ice with it.
#unknown Hold that.
#unknown What's it feel like? There's a chill.
#unknown Don't freak out.
#unknown It passes.
#unknown And then.
#unknown You'll see.
#unknown I'll meet you there.
#unknown Take that off.
#unknown Phones off, please.
#unknown Pipes, I guess.
#unknown All right, everyone.
#unknown Eyes on your paper.
#unknown Eyes on your paper.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Excuse me, where's the manager? I'm the manager.
#unknown Can I help you? No, no, no.
#unknown I met a man here last week.
#unknown He's a black gentleman.
#unknown He's thin.
#unknown Glasses.
#unknown Yes, sir.
#unknown That's the owner.
#unknown Oh, owner.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants in between here and Nevada.
#unknown He could be at any one of them.
#unknown Is there a phone number that I can get to? I'm sorry, sir.
#unknown I can't give that out.
#unknown Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy to refer you to our website.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown What's his name? Gustavo.
#unknown Gus.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thirtyeight pounds, $1.
#unknown 2 million.
#unknown Truck stop, two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.
#unknown One hour.
#unknown What? One hour.
#unknown You in or out? In.
#unknown In.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown But I just need a little more time.
#unknown One hour.
#unknown If you miss it don't ever show your face in here again.
#unknown Exit 13 off the 25 South, to a truck.
#unknown Come on! Come on! Yo, if I know you, leave a message.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse, pick up the phone.
#unknown Pick up the phone.
#unknown I'm coming by.
#unknown I need the product.
#unknown I need the product now.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse! Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse, wake up.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse, wake up.
#unknown Wake up.
#unknown Wake up! Come on, damn it.
#unknown Wake up.
#unknown Where'd you put it? Where's the product? Get off of me.
#unknown Where is it? Where'd you hide the meth? ln the kitchen.
#unknown Where? Under the sink.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Not now, not now.
#unknown Not now!
