jesse_pinkman  sighs Yo, I thought I was going to see some, like, vaginas.
jane_margolis  I didn't say she actually painted vaginas.
jane_margolis  I said some of her paintings looked like vaginas.
jesse_pinkman  seriously?
jesse_pinkman  Not even close
Jane_Margolis  Georgia O'Keeffe painted all kinds of stuff.
jane_margolis  Everyday items, her surroundings.
jane_margolis  Some of it evoked an erotic nature.
jane_margolis  who she was
jesse_pinkman  Not like any vagina I ever saw.
jesse_pinkman  This chick have medical issues?
jane_margolis  This particular painting Mmm. is of a door.
jesse_pinkman  Any other doors we can check out? Like
jesse_pinkman  Like, real ones
jesse_pinkman  You know, III don't get it.
jesse_pinkman  Why would anyone paint a picture of a door over and over again, like, dozens of times?
jane_margolis  But it wasn't the same.
jesse_pinkman  yeah, it was.
jane_margolis  It was the same subject, but it was different every time. The
jane_margolis  The light was different. Her mood was different. She
jane_margolis  She saw something new every time she painted it.
jesse_pinkman  And that's not psycho to you?
jane_margolis  Well, then, why should we do anything more than once?
jane_margolis  Should I just smoke this one cigarette?
jane_margolis  Maybe we should only have sex once if it's the same thing.
jesse_pinkman  Whoa, no Should
jane_margolis  Should we just watch one sunset?
jane_margolis  Or live just one day.
jane_margolis  Because it's new every time.
jane_margolis  Each time, it's a different experience.
jesse_pinkman  Okay,
jesse_pinkman  I guess the cow skull pictures were cool, but a door?
jesse_pinkman  I will say it again.
jesse_pinkman  chuckles A door.
jane_margolis  Why not a door?
Jane_Margolis  Sometimes you get fixated on something, and you might not even get why.
jane_margolis  You open yourself up and go with the flow, wherever the universe takes you.
jesse_pinkman  snickers Okay, so the universe took her to a door,
jesse_pinkman  she got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it No
jane_margolis  No, I wouldn't say that.
jane_margolis  Nothing's perfect. Yeah? Well
jesse_pinkman  yeah.
jesse_pinkman  Some things.
jane_margolis  that was so sweet, I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit
jesse_pinkman  You can't admit just for once that I'm right.
jesse_pinkman  Come on.
jesse_pinkman  That O'Keeffe lady kept trying over and over until that stupid door was perfect. No
jane_margolis  No. That
jane_margolis  That door was her home, and she loved it.
jane_margolis  To me, that's about making that feeling last.
physical_therapist  All right, here we go.
physical_therapist  You ready?
physical_therapist  Come on, give me a step.
physical_therapist  Give me one step.
hank_schrader  it.
hank_schrader  Take me up.

marie_schrader  Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
marie_schrader  Pain is weakness leaving your body.
hank_schrader  Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie. Hey
marie_schrader  Hey, if you can get your leg up that high, I say go
hank_schrader  go for
physical_therapist  All right, coffee break.

physical_therapist  grunts machine whirrs

walter_white  I'll do that.
jesse_pinkman  the hell,

jesse_pinkman  This is bullshit.
jesse_pinkman  Just say it.
jesse_pinkman  Just say the words.
jesse_pinkman  You think I'm stealing.
group_leader  Walk with who you are.
group_leader  was a phrase my sponsor used to use with me back when I first started coming to meetings.
group_leader  It's probably just a different way of saying" Be yourself." Right?
group_leader  But this idea of" walk" also tells me that I have to move forward.
group_leader  Always good advice, at least for me.
group_leader  I see we have some new people here at group, a couple new faces.
group_leader  see some hands.
group_leader  First time?
group_leader  Great.
group_leader  Welcome.
group_leader  Maybe we can go around, introduce ourselves.
group_leader  Say whatever's on your mind.
group_leader  How about you? You
group_leader  want to start us
andrea_cantillo  Yeah.
andrea_cantillo  My name is Andrea
group_leader  We don't bite.
group_leader  No judgments.
group_leader  You can be as open and honest as you want to be.
andrea_cantillo  Honestly,
andrea_cantillo  I don't want to be here.
group_leader  enough. Who
group_leader  Who else had their hand up?
jesse_pinkman  Jesse.
badger  hello.
badger  My name is Brandon.
badger  And this is, I believe, Peter?
skinny_pete  Right. I'm Peter. How
skinny_pete  How are you?
jesse_pinkman  Look, I just wanted to give you a heads up
jesse_pinkman  It's gonna get a little slower smuggling product with Grandpa Anus watching every move I make

badger  I sold a teenth.
jesse_pinkman  One teenth?
jesse_pinkman  it? Yeah.
jesse_pinkman  To him.
badger  Look, it's not so easy selling to these people.
badger  They're here trying to better themselves. Yeah
skinny_pete  Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff going on here.
jesse_pinkman  out risking my ass to get product for you two, and you're too pussy to sell? You're

jesse_pinkman  All
jesse_pinkman  it.
jesse_pinkman  I'll sell it myself.
badger  Come on, man. Don't
badger  Don't be like that.
badger  Selling to these people, it's like shooting a baby in the face. It's not natural.
skinny_pete  Jesse, it's not easy like you think.
jesse_pinkman  I'll show you exactly how easy it is.
jesse_pinkman  Sorry.
andrea_cantillo  No. Go ahead.
jesse_pinkman  Andrea, right?
andrea_cantillo  Hey
jesse_pinkman  um, my name's Jesse, and, uh, I don't really want to be here, either.
jesse_pinkman  chuckles Thanks.
walter_white_jr.  Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?
skyler_white  No.
skyler_white  Your dad is. Walter, Jr.
walter_white_jr.  How'd you get her to sleep so quick?
walter_white_jr.  you that boring?
walter_white  comforting.
walter_white  I'm a comforting presence.
walter_white_jr.  so check it out.
walter_white_jr.  See what that means?
walter_white_jr.  Check out the date.
walter_white_jr.  Next Thursday is officially six months that I have had my learner's,
walter_white_jr.  which means I can get my provisional and start driving by myself.
walter_white  Since when? You don't turn 16 for two more months. It
walter_white_jr.  It doesn't matter. It's a provisional. Look
walter_white_jr.  Look it up.
walter_white_jr.  They changed the law, like, 10 years ago. Oh
walter_white  Oh, yeah? Well, I didn't vote
walter_white_jr.  for that. Doesn't matter if you voted for it. It's the law.
walter_white_jr.  So both of you start thinking about what kind of car you want to buy me.
walter_white_jr.  I think I'd be good with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.
skyler_white  a 'Stang.
walter_white  about something with playing cards in the spokes?
walter_white  Makes a nice motory
walter_white_jr.  sound, you know? imitates motor clicking chuckles both laughing Yeah, yeah. You're not gonna get off that easy.
skyler_white  Well, I I think that this is
skyler_white  We should probably table this discussion for later.
skyler_white  Your dad and I have a couple things we need to talk about, so Okay
walter_white_jr.  A 1971 Mach 1 fastback in Grabber Lime with a shaker hood.
walter_white_jr. 'Stang.
walter_white  write that down so I don't forget. Oh
walter_white  darn it. No pencil!
skyler_white  What is Ice Station Zebra Associates?
walter_white  It's a loanout. It's fine
skyler_white  Whose loanout?
walter_white  fine.
walter_white  Really.
walter_white  Ihave a guy.
skyler_white  Okay.
skyler_white  does your guy know the tax code and regulations in New Mexico?
skyler_white  'Cause there's very specific paperwork that has to be submitted quarterly on this.
walter_white  Yes.
walter_white  My guy is a top guy. Who
skyler_white  Who is he?
skyler_white  What's his name?
skyler_white  What are his qualifications?
skyler_white  Walt, this money has to be unimpeachable when it reaches Hank and Marie.
walter_white  And it is.
walter_white  It will be.
skyler_white  But how do I know that?
skyler_white  I mean, apparently, you can't even tell me the man's name.
walter_white  Oh. Jesus. Skyler, do you really want to know?
walter_white  I mean, do you really
saul_goodman  What a pleasure it is to have you.
saul_goodman  I'm just gonna call you Skyler, if that's okay. It's
saul_goodman  It's a lovely name.
saul_goodman  Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.
saul_goodman  Walt never told me how lucky he was
saul_goodman  prior to recent unfortunate events.
saul_goodman  Clearly, his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers only the very best with just the right amount of dirty.
saul_goodman  That's a joke.
saul_goodman  That's a joke.
saul_goodman  It's funny because you are so clearly very classy. Here
saul_goodman  Here. Please, sit down.
saul_goodman  So Walt tells me that you have some concerns I can alleviate.
skyler_white  yes, I do.
skyler_white  I have concerns.
skyler_white  If we're going to go down this road, and clearly we are for the sake of my brotherinlaw.
saul_goodman  I've heard about him.
saul_goodman  He's an American hero.
skyler_white  At any rate, I need some assurances that we're gonna go about this in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious.
saul_goodman  Fair enough.
saul_goodman  I'll walk you through the process.
saul_goodman  First step is something we like to call money laundering, all right?
saul_goodman  Take your money, represented by, say, these jelly beans.
skyler_white  You know, I'm a bookkeeper Then I so I actually know what money laundering is.
saul_goodman  Well Yeah
skyler_white  And, as with most things, the devil is in the details. So
skyler_white  So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money?
saul_goodman  That's simple.
saul_goodman  Walt here actually came up with a great story about gambling winnings.
saul_goodman  Blackjack, right?
saul_goodman  Some card counting? Well
walter_white  actually, that was Skyler's idea.
saul_goodman  Well, you grow more gorgeous by the minute.
saul_goodman  there you have it.
saul_goodman  I'll generate false currency transaction reports out the wazoo. As well as the necessary W2Gs.
saul_goodman  I know a couple casino managers who will jump at the chance to report false losses.
saul_goodman  It's a winwin for everyone.
skyler_white  but you can't sell that for very long.
saul_goodman  Yeah, yeah,
saul_goodman  Way ahead of you.
saul_goodman  We declare just enough so as not to arouse suspicion, then Walt's onetime winnings become seed money for an investment.
skyler_white  Investment in what?
saul_goodman  Drum roll please.
saul_goodman  Wait for it.
saul_goodman  Laser tag.
saul_goodman  Laser tag.
saul_goodman  of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernlillo County.
skyler_white  Laser tag?
saul_goodman  Yeah. There's guns and glow lights and Kids wear the vests,
skyler_white  and they have to split
skyler_white  split into teams Right. No, actually, I know what it is.
skyler_white  It's just that in relation to Walt, it's I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
saul_goodman  makes more sense than you two being together. I'm still trying to figure out how that happened. Do
skyler_white  Do you even know Walt?
skyler_white  I mean how would he of all people buy a laser tag business?
skyler_white  It doesn't add up.
saul_goodman  It adds up perfectly.
saul_goodman  Walt's a scientist. Scientists love lasers.
saul_goodman  Plus they got bumper boats, so Hey
skyler_white  Hey, everybody. Walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag.
skyler_white  Just out of the blue.
skyler_white  Really?
skyler_white  That's what we're supposed to tell people, our family, our friends, the government?
saul_goodman  Let me bottom line this for you.
saul_goodman  You don't need to be involved. Because
saul_goodman  Because I've been doing this for a lot of years successfully, believe it or not without your help.
saul_goodman  So thank you for stopping by.
andrea_cantillo  You want a beer
andrea_cantillo  something? Or something
andrea_cantillo  do you mean? laughs Like beer. laughs I'm clean out of anything else.
andrea_cantillo  Even if I wasn't, we're not supposed to.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah.
jesse_pinkman  I've heard it over and over and over again.
jesse_pinkman  You know, don't you think it's ridiculous that society says beer is okay and a little hit of something sweet is wrong?
jesse_pinkman  I mean what's the point of shutting yourself off completely from something that lifts you off the ground?
jesse_pinkman  I spend so much energy fighting the urge not to use, and I feel like crap because of it.
andrea_cantillo  It's just
jesse_pinkman  What?
andrea_cantillo  can't get caught using again.
jesse_pinkman  the thing is whispering not to get caught.
jesse_pinkman  You ever try that blue stuff that's going around?
jesse_pinkman  a little gas in the tank, and suddenly everything is interesting.
jesse_pinkman  Man, I wish I can make that feeling last. Like I said, I got nothing here. What if I could get
andrea_cantillo  door opens Mommy!
jesse_pinkman  Mommy!
brock_cantillo  Oh
andrea_cantillo  your Nana brought you home
andrea_cantillo  early. Grandma, I thought you were keeping Brock today.
mrs._cantillo  I was. Then I saw your car.
mrs._cantillo  I thought you had a meeting.
andrea_cantillo  I did, but we changed the time.
andrea_cantillo  Grandma, this is Jesse.
andrea_cantillo  He's from the meeting.
andrea_cantillo  He's like a sponsor.
andrea_cantillo  Jesse, this is Grandma.
andrea_cantillo  Jesse, this is Brock.
jesse_pinkman  So, you, uh You have a kid, huh?
jesse_pinkman  What's up
jesse_pinkman  Brock, huh?
jesse_pinkman  cool name.
jesse_pinkman  Here. Give it up.
andrea_cantillo  Brock is almost 6.
andrea_cantillo  You okay with kids?
jesse_pinkman  What?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah
jesse_pinkman  he's cool.
andrea_cantillo  Okay, Brock is gonna go play in his room while the big people talk.
andrea_cantillo  He's gonna go play with his Legos and his cars Say
andrea_cantillo  Say" Bye, Jesse.
brock_cantillo " Bye, Jesse.
skyler_white  Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking, and that man is neither.
walter_white  I'll admit, he comes across like a circus clown. But he actually knows what he's doing.
walter_white  Safe and cautious is you not being involved in this at all. Well
skyler_white  Well, it's a little late on that.
skyler_white  This is what happens when you decide to pay our bills with drug money.
walter_white  Skyler, this isn't just about what happened before.
walter_white  My involvement in this is ongoing. Understand
walter_white  I can't just quit.
walter_white  I have something of a contract.
walter_white  It's all very safe and professional and
walter_white  structured.
walter_white  I can't simply quit.
walter_white  are you going?
skyler_white  If you're gonna launder money, Walt, at least do it right.
skyler_white  You worked here four years.
skyler_white  It's a business you understand.
skyler_white  It's a story people will believe.
skyler_white  Not laser tag. This
skyler_white  This is what we buy.
skyler_white  This is what you
badger  muttering Hey
badger  Hey,
badger  Jesse, right?
badger  Brandon. Peter.
badger  How goes it?
badger  Hanging in there?
jesse_pinkman  Please, just Dumb ass
badger  Sorry, man.
badger  I was trying to keep it on the DL.
skinny_pete  So you and that girl, you do the deed yet?
jesse_pinkman  Do what
skinny_pete  You know, sell to her
jesse_pinkman  two even doing here?
skinny_pete  you mean?
jesse_pinkman  can't get your nut up to sell. What's the point of even coming?
skinny_pete  Homie, I'm on, like, step 5.
badger  Deuce, yo. I'm
badger  catching up.
skinny_pete  Dude needs to come into the fold.
jesse_pinkman  Oh, you know,
jesse_pinkman  I have magical powers.
jesse_pinkman  You want to see?
brock_cantillo  That's not real.
jesse_pinkman  laughs whispers
jesse_pinkman  do you want to see something that's real?
jesse_pinkman  at this.
jesse_pinkman  this. Ready
jesse_pinkman  You like that?
jesse_pinkman  That's science and stuff. Makes it do that.
brock_cantillo  Let
andrea_cantillo  Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock. It's
jesse_pinkman  It's okay.
jesse_pinkman  It's okay. Want to
jesse_pinkman  see it again
brock_cantillo  Could you do a trick with firecrackers?
jesse_pinkman  Firecrackers.
jesse_pinkman  You know, I don't have any firecrackers on me.
jesse_pinkman  Who does tricks with firecrackers? TomÃ¡s. TomÃ¡s
jesse_pinkman  does tricks with firecrackers, huh?
jesse_pinkman  Who's TomÃ¡s?
andrea_cantillo  He's my kid brother.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah
andrea_cantillo  And we don't talk about him
andrea_cantillo  Brock. Jesse Can I have a chip? I'm gonna steal your chip. Brock
jesse_pinkman  that's mine
jesse_pinkman  mine.
saul_goodman  That's it?
saul_goodman  That's what you want to buy?
walter_white  will believe it at
walter_white  I worked here for four years.
saul_goodman  on, wax off. Was that you?
saul_goodman  how come you guys always get with the air freshener,
saul_goodman  I explicitly say I want no air freshener, and every time I drive away smelling like an Alpine w3 house.
saul_goodman  All due respect, I don't see it.
saul_goodman  So I vote no.
walter_white  Makes a better story than your laser tag.
saul_goodman  that you talking or Yoko Ono?
walter_white  She has a point.
walter_white  It makes more sense that I invest right here.
saul_goodman  Based on her years of experience in money laundering, I suppose.
saul_goodman  Let me tell you something. If you're committed enough, you can make any story work.
saul_goodman  I once convinced a woman that I was Kevin Costner. And it worked because I believed it. It
saul_goodman  It has nothing to do with the story.
saul_goodman  Besides, this dump isn't gonna work because it doesn't have a Danny. Okay
saul_goodman  Okay? There's no Danny here.
walter_white  in God's name is a Danny?
saul_goodman  Danny runs the laser tag.
saul_goodman  Danny is the guy who had a vision.
saul_goodman  Where others saw a dirt lot, he saw black lights, rubber aliens, teenagers running around with ray guns, right? It
saul_goodman  was like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.
saul_goodman  when the stock market took a shit and Danny got into trouble, he went searching for exactly the type of situation that we're offering.
saul_goodman  Danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat.
saul_goodman  In other words, Danny can be trusted completely.
saul_goodman  That guy the guy with the eyebrows that won't quit is he a Danny?
saul_goodman  buy this place, all you got is a big building that squirts water.
saul_goodman  You got no Danny here.
andrea_cantillo  want to stay for dinner? Yeah.
jesse_pinkman  Thanks
jesse_pinkman  Thanks.
jesse_pinkman  What time is it?
andrea_cantillo  Early still.
andrea_cantillo  What? I thought maybe, if you're holding, we can do something.
jesse_pinkman  What?
andrea_cantillo  You know, that blue stuff you were talking about
andrea_cantillo  Maybe you had a line on some.
jesse_pinkman  you said the kid is coming home.
andrea_cantillo  Yeah, in a few hours.
jesse_pinkman  And you seriously want to get high?
andrea_cantillo  I don't know what you're getting so pissed about.
andrea_cantillo  You're the one who brought it up the other day.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, that was before I found out you got a kid.
jesse_pinkman  What kind of mother are you?
andrea_cantillo  What?
jesse_pinkman  You heard me
jesse_pinkman  me. What kind of mom gets wasted with a little kid to take care of?
andrea_cantillo  Nobody can say I don't take care of my son.
andrea_cantillo  You gonna come in my house and judge me?
andrea_cantillo  Like you got no responsibility, so it's okay for you to get high.
andrea_cantillo  What do you know about me?
andrea_cantillo  I take care of my baby.
andrea_cantillo  I'll do anything for him.
andrea_cantillo  The day Brock was born, I swore I won't let what happened to TomÃ¡s happen to my son.
andrea_cantillo  I'll die first.
jesse_pinkman  I I just
jesse_pinkman  get out of here if you want.
andrea_cantillo  you want to do, then go.
jesse_pinkman  It's not what I want
jesse_pinkman  Look
andrea_cantillo  We both were.
jesse_pinkman  You're right. I don't know what you've been through.
jesse_pinkman  You can tell me if you want.
andrea_cantillo  This whole neighborhood is run by gangs.
andrea_cantillo  They run the drugs, control the streets.
andrea_cantillo  they sort of took TomÃ¡s in.
andrea_cantillo  No dad around.
andrea_cantillo  they got TomÃ¡s slinging.
andrea_cantillo  Part of some crew.
andrea_cantillo  Then, when he was 10 for some initiation or something they made him kill somebody.
andrea_cantillo  I heard the rumors.
andrea_cantillo  I didn't believe it at first.
andrea_cantillo  then I saw him, like, a weekater.
andrea_cantillo  He told me, yeah, he did it.
andrea_cantillo  They gave TomÃ¡s a gun.
andrea_cantillo  Gave him a choice.
andrea_cantillo  or some dude.
andrea_cantillo  So he did it.
andrea_cantillo  Told me all about it like it was nothing.
jesse_pinkman  he say he killed?
andrea_cantillo  Some dealer
andrea_cantillo  lips from some
andrea_cantillo  outside crew. Right around the corner from here, over off the Central.
andrea_cantillo  Just rode up on his bike and shot him.
jesse_pinkman  Like, over by the train tracks?
jesse_pinkman  When was this?
andrea_cantillo  few months back.
jesse_pinkman  What else did he tell you?
andrea_cantillo  He shot the guy right through the neck.
andrea_cantillo  Shot him dead.
andrea_cantillo  Just because he was working the wrong corner.
andrea_cantillo  It won't happen again.
andrea_cantillo  Not to my son.
marie_schrader  Guess what.
hank_schrader  People who say" Guess what" and then actually expect you to guess I hate those people.
marie_schrader  Well, I just heard about a certain patient named SchradercommaHank who is going to be released at the end of this week.
marie_schrader  Isn't that fantastic?
hank_schrader  Are they planning on rolling me out the front door at
hank_schrader  they'll put me on a greased plank and, uh, slide me out the window?
hank_schrader  Hey. Listen, I don't care what any damned insurance company thinks.
hank_schrader  not leaving here until I'm well.
marie_schrader  Hank, this isn't about insurance. I've talked
marie_schrader  to everybody, and they all say that you are healthy enough to go home.
hank_schrader  Oh, I'm healthy enough, huh?
hank_schrader  Yeah
marie_schrader  Hank, you get stronger every day.
marie_schrader  You don't need to be in a hospital.
hank_schrader  In this condition, yeah, I do.
marie_schrader  You'll be just as comfortable at home as you are here.
marie_schrader  You'll have all the same equipment All
hank_schrader  All the same equipment?
hank_schrader  What The equipment
marie_schrader  equipment does that mean? that you have here that you need.
marie_schrader  Short term.
marie_schrader  You'll do your PT at home, and it'll be great because you'll be home.
marie_schrader  Wait till you see the bedroom.
marie_schrader  I had them move the plasma in
marie_schrader  I know that's how you always wanted it, and
marie_schrader  and you only had to get shot to get it, right?
marie_schrader  I got you a new bed.
hank_schrader  A hospital bed?
hank_schrader  put a hospital bed in my bedroom?
marie_schrader  Hank, you'll be home.
hank_schrader  You get that out of my house.
hank_schrader  You hear me,
hank_schrader  Today.
marie_schrader  Hank I
hank_schrader  I leave this hospital when I walk out of here,
hank_schrader  you understand?
hank_schrader  And not before.
skyler_white  What's a Danny?
walter_white  Danny is an accomplice
walter_white  someone who's in on the scheme, who knows about laundering, who's paid to look the other way.
walter_white  Now, while I agree with you that laser tag is a hard sell, without a Danny, the car wash isn't really an option.
skyler_white  And he can't get you another Danny to run the car wash?
walter_white  Easier said than done,
walter_white  if we're looking for someone trustworthy.
skyler_white  What about me?
walter_white  What about you?
skyler_white  Me.
skyler_white  I'll be the Danny.
walter_white  No.
walter_white  No, Skyler. That is not a good idea.

skyler_white  Who else could we trust? No
walter_white  No.
skyler_white  Walt. I'm in this
skyler_white  if I'm in it, I'm going to do
walter_white  do it right.

walter_white  You are not
skyler_white  not We're married. How am I not in this?
walter_white  We are not married, Skyler. We're divorced.

walter_white  An invitation.
gustavo_fring  Walter. You're right on time
gustavo_fring  time. Please, come in
gustavo_fring  I hope you like paila marina.
gustavo_fring  It's a fancy name for fish
gustavo_fring  It sounds like a clichÃ©, but indeed, it's just like my mother used to make it.
gustavo_fring  Come on.
gustavo_fring  You can help me cook.
gustavo_fring  This is a Chilean dish that I love, but I never get to make it.
gustavo_fring  kids won't eat it.
gustavo_fring  But, uh you know how that is. Sure.
gustavo_fring  Do you mind?
gustavo_fring  Would you slice the garlic? Oh.
gustavo_fring  Very thin.
walter_white  Why did you invite me here?
gustavo_fring  We're working together. Why not break bread together?
gustavo_fring  It always amazes me the way the senses work in connection to memory
gustavo_fring  I mean, this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients.
gustavo_fring  Taken separately, these ingredients alone don't remind me of anything.
gustavo_fring  Hmm. chuckling Not very much at all
gustavo_fring  But, in this precise combination, the smell of this meal instantly it brings me back to my childhood.
gustavo_fring  How is that possible
walter_white  Basically, it all takes place in the hippocampus.
walter_white  Neural connections are formed.
walter_white  The senses make the neurons express signals that go right back to the same part of the brain as before
walter_white  memory is stored.
walter_white  That's
walter_white  memory. Uh don't quote me on that. I
walter_white  I'm rusty on my biology.
gustavo_fring  That's very interesting.
gustavo_fring  Walter, I would like to help you, if I could. Help me how
walter_white  first started
gustavo_fring  made a lot of mistakes
gustavo_fring  More than I care to admit.
gustavo_fring  I'd had someone to advise me chuckle because this life of ours, it can overwhelm.
gustavo_fring  You are a wealthy man now
gustavo_fring  one must learn to be rich.
gustavo_fring  To be poor anyone can manage.
walter_white  What advice do you have for me
gustavo_fring  Never make the same mistake twice.
