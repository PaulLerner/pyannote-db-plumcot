#unknown [sighs] Yo, I thought I was going to see some, like, vaginas.
#unknown I didn't say she actually painted vaginas.
#unknown I said some of her paintings looked like vaginas.
#unknown Uh, seriously? [whispers] Not even close.
#unknown [chuckles] Georgia O'Keeffe painted all kinds of stuff.
#unknown Huh.
#unknown Everyday items, her surroundings.
#unknown Some of it evoked an erotic nature.
#unknown [snickers] It's who she was.
#unknown Not like any vagina I ever saw.
#unknown This chick have medical issues? This particular painting Mmm.
#unknown is of a door.
#unknown Any other doors we can check out? Like, real ones or [groans] You know, III don't get it.
#unknown Why would anyone paint a picture of a door over and over again, like, dozens of times? But it wasn't the same.
#unknown Uh, yeah, it was.
#unknown It was the same subject, but it was different every time.
#unknown The light was different.
#unknown Her mood was different.
#unknown She saw something new every time she painted it.
#unknown And that's not psycho to you? Well, then, why should we do anything more than once? Should I just smoke this one cigarette? Maybe we should only have sex once if it's the same thing.
#unknown Whoa, no Should we just watch one sunset? Or live just one day.
#unknown Because it's new every time.
#unknown Each time, it's a different experience.
#unknown Okay, fine.
#unknown I guess the cow skull pictures were cool, but a door? I will say it again.
#unknown [chuckles] A door.
#unknown [snores] [chuckles] Why not a door? Sometimes you get fixated on something, and you might not even get why.
#unknown You open yourself up and go with the flow, wherever the universe takes you.
#unknown [snickers] Okay, so the universe took her to a door, and she got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it No, I wouldn't say that.
#unknown Nothing's perfect.
#unknown Yeah? Well Oh, yeah.
#unknown Some things.
#unknown [giggles] Oh, that was so sweet, I think I threw up in my mouth a little bit.
#unknown [laughs] You can't admit just for once that I'm right.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown That O'Keeffe lady kept trying over and over until that stupid door was perfect.
#unknown No.
#unknown That door was her home, and she loved it.
#unknown To me, that's about making that feeling last.
#unknown [machine whirring] All right, here we go.
#unknown You ready? [labored breathing] Come on, give me a step.
#unknown Give me one step.
#unknown [exhales] Nope.
#unknown Nope, that's it.
#unknown Take me up.
#unknown You can do this, Hank.
#unknown Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
#unknown Pain is weakness leaving your body.
#unknown Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.
#unknown Hey, if you can get your leg up that high, I say go for it.
#unknown Take me up.
#unknown Take me up.
#unknown All right, coffee break.
#unknown We're gonna let you rest for a minute, and then we're gonna try it again.
#unknown Never mind about your coffee break.
#unknown Take me up.
#unknown I'm done.
#unknown I'm done.
#unknown [grunts] [machine whirrs] Come on, Uncle Hank.
#unknown You can do it.
#unknown How else are you going to get out of here? Don't you have any friends? I mean Jesus, find something better to do.
#unknown I don't need everyone staring at me hanging here like a camel's ball sack.
#unknown Hank, he just wants to be supportive.
#unknown It's all right.
#unknown All right, I'll be right back.
#unknown Okay? I'll be right back.
#unknown You gonna get me out of here sometime today? [machine whirring] Honey We got our first bill, and, you know, if you're still insistent I am.
#unknown Prepare yourself.
#unknown [whispers] Yeah.
#unknown They're gonna start coming in weekly like that, so Okay.
#unknown You're sure you can do this? Yeah.
#unknown [scale beeps] I'll do that.
#unknown [scale beeps] What the hell, man? What, I can't work a scale now? This is bullshit.
#unknown Just say it.
#unknown Just say the words.
#unknown You think I'm stealing.
#unknown Shh.
#unknown [Group leader] Walk with who you are.
#unknown That was a phrase my sponsor used to use with me back when I first started coming to meetings.
#unknown It's probably just a different way of saying "Be yourself.
#unknown " Right? But this idea of "walk" also tells me that I have to move forward.
#unknown Always good advice, at least for me.
#unknown I see we have some new people here at group, a couple new faces.
#unknown Let's see some hands.
#unknown First time? Great.
#unknown Welcome.
#unknown Maybe we can go around, introduce ourselves.
#unknown Say whatever's on your mind.
#unknown How about you? You want to start us off? [clears throat] Yeah.
#unknown My name is Andrea and, uh We don't bite.
#unknown No judgments.
#unknown You can be as open and honest as you want to be.
#unknown Honestly, I don't want to be here.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Fair enough.
#unknown Who else had their hand up? Hey.
#unknown 'Sup? My name's Jesse.
#unknown Why, hello.
#unknown My name is Brandon.
#unknown And this is, I believe, Peter? Right.
#unknown I'm Peter.
#unknown How are you? Look, I just wanted to give you a heads up.
#unknown It's gonna get a little slower smuggling product with Grandpa Anus watching every move I make.
#unknown But don't worry.
#unknown I'll keep it flowing.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Right on.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown So how's it selling? Mad volume? Yeah.
#unknown It's, uh You know, it's, um It's not so good.
#unknown What do you mean? How much have you sold? I sold a teenth.
#unknown One teenth? That's it? Yeah.
#unknown To who? To him.
#unknown Look, it's not so easy selling to these people.
#unknown They're here trying to better themselves.
#unknown Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff going on here.
#unknown I'm out risking my ass to get product for you two, and you're too pussy to sell? You're pathetic.
#unknown You know what? I want it back.
#unknown All of it.
#unknown I'll sell it myself.
#unknown Come on, man.
#unknown Don't be like that.
#unknown Selling to these people, it's like shooting a baby in the face.
#unknown It's not natural.
#unknown Yeah, Jesse, it's not easy like you think.
#unknown I'll show you exactly how easy it is.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown No.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown It's Andrea, right? Yeah.
#unknown Hey, um, my name's Jesse, and, uh, I don't really want to be here, either.
#unknown Oh, um Sorry.
#unknown [chuckles] Thanks.
#unknown Aunt Marie's coming to dinner? No.
#unknown Your dad is.
#unknown [Walter, Jr.
#unknown ] How'd you get her to sleep so quick? Are you that boring? I'm comforting.
#unknown I'm a comforting presence.
#unknown [whispers] There we go.
#unknown Shh, shh.
#unknown Hey, so check it out.
#unknown Huh? See what that means? Check out the date.
#unknown Next Thursday is officially six months that I have had my learner's, which means I can get my provisional and start driving by myself.
#unknown Since when? You don't turn 16 for two more months.
#unknown It doesn't matter.
#unknown It's a provisional.
#unknown Look it up.
#unknown They changed the law, like, 10 years ago.
#unknown Oh, yeah? Well, I didn't vote for that.
#unknown Doesn't matter if you voted for it.
#unknown It's the law.
#unknown So both of you start thinking about what kind of car you want to buy me.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown I think I'd be good with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.
#unknown Ah, a 'Stang.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Mmhmm.
#unknown How about something with playing cards in the spokes? Makes a nice motory sound, you know? [imitates motor clicking] [chuckles] [both laughing] Yeah, yeah.
#unknown You're not gonna get off that easy.
#unknown Well, I I think that this is, um We should probably table this discussion for later.
#unknown Your dad and I have a couple things we need to talk about, so Okay.
#unknown A 1971 Mach 1 fastback in Grabber Lime with a shaker hood.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown 'Stang.
#unknown I want to write that down so I don't forget.
#unknown Oh, darn it.
#unknown No pencil! [groans] [laughing] What is Ice Station Zebra Associates? It's a loanout.
#unknown It's fine.
#unknown Whose loanout? It's fine.
#unknown Really.
#unknown Ihave a guy.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Um, does your guy know the tax code and regulations in New Mexico? 'Cause there's very specific paperwork that has to be submitted quarterly on this.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown My guy is a top guy.
#unknown Who is he? Uh.
#unknown What's his name? What are his qualifications? Walt, this money has to be unimpeachable when it reaches Hank and Marie.
#unknown And it is.
#unknown It will be.
#unknown But how do I know that? I mean, apparently, you can't even tell me the man's name.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Skyler, do you really want to know? I mean, do you really want to know? Really? [man coughing] [coughing continues] [door closes] [Saul] Hello.
#unknown Welcome.
#unknown What a pleasure it is to have you.
#unknown I'm just gonna call you Skyler, if that's okay.
#unknown It's a lovely name.
#unknown Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.
#unknown Walt never told me how lucky he was prior to recent unfortunate events.
#unknown Clearly, his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers only the very best with just the right amount of dirty.
#unknown [laughs] That's a joke.
#unknown That's a joke.
#unknown It's funny because you are so clearly very classy.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Please, sit down.
#unknown So Walt tells me that you have some concerns I can alleviate.
#unknown Uh, yes, I do.
#unknown I have concerns.
#unknown If we're going to go down this road, and clearly we are for the sake of my brotherinlaw.
#unknown I've heard about him.
#unknown He's an American hero.
#unknown At any rate, I need some assurances that we're gonna go about this in a manner that is extremely safe and cautious.
#unknown Fair enough.
#unknown I'll walk you through the process.
#unknown First step is something we like to call money laundering, all right? Take your money, represented by, say, these jelly beans.
#unknown You know, I'm a bookkeeper Then I so I actually know what money laundering is.
#unknown Uhhuh.
#unknown Well Yeah.
#unknown And, as with most things, the devil is in the details.
#unknown So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money? That's simple.
#unknown Walt here actually came up with a great story about gambling winnings.
#unknown Blackjack, right? Some card counting? Well, actually, that was Skyler's idea.
#unknown [clears throat] Well, you grow more gorgeous by the minute.
#unknown Well, there you have it.
#unknown I'll generate false currency transaction reports out the wazoo.
#unknown As well as the necessary W2Gs.
#unknown I know a couple casino managers who will jump at the chance to report false losses.
#unknown It's a winwin for everyone.
#unknown Yeah, but you can't sell that for very long.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, yeah.
#unknown Way ahead of you.
#unknown We declare just enough so as not to arouse suspicion, then Walt's onetime winnings become seed money for an investment.
#unknown Investment in what? Drum roll please.
#unknown Wait for it.
#unknown Laser tag.
#unknown Laser tag.
#unknown of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernlillo County.
#unknown Laser tag? Yeah.
#unknown There's guns and glow lights and Kids wear the vests, and they have to split into teams Right.
#unknown No, actually, I know what it is.
#unknown It's just that in relation to Walt, it's I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
#unknown It makes more sense than you two being together.
#unknown I'm still trying to figure out how that happened.
#unknown Do you even know Walt? I mean how would he of all people buy a laser tag business? It doesn't add up.
#unknown It adds up perfectly.
#unknown Walt's a scientist.
#unknown Scientists love lasers.
#unknown Plus they got bumper boats, so Hey, everybody.
#unknown Walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag.
#unknown Just out of the blue.
#unknown Really? That's what we're supposed to tell people, our family, our friends, the government? Let me bottom line this for you.
#unknown You don't need to be involved.
#unknown Because I've been doing this for a lot of years successfully, believe it or not without your help.
#unknown So thank you for stopping by.
#unknown You want a beer or something? Or something.
#unknown What do you mean? [laughs] Like beer.
#unknown [laughs] I'm clean out of anything else.
#unknown Even if I wasn't, we're not supposed to.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I've heard it over and over and over again.
#unknown You know, don't you think it's ridiculous that society says beer is okay and a little hit of something sweet is wrong? I mean what's the point of shutting yourself off completely from something that lifts you off the ground? I spend so much energy fighting the urge not to use, and I feel like crap because of it.
#unknown I know.
#unknown It's just What? I can't get caught using again.
#unknown See, the thing is [whispering] not to get caught.
#unknown You ever try that blue stuff that's going around? [exhales] Just a little gas in the tank, and suddenly everything is interesting.
#unknown Man, I wish I can make that feeling last.
#unknown Like I said, I got nothing here.
#unknown What if I could get some? [door opens] Mommy! Mommy! Hey, B! Oh, your Nana brought you home early.
#unknown Grandma, I thought you were keeping Brock today.
#unknown I was.
#unknown Then I saw your car.
#unknown I thought you had a meeting.
#unknown I did, but we changed the time.
#unknown Grandma, this is Jesse.
#unknown He's from the meeting.
#unknown He's like a sponsor.
#unknown Jesse, this is Grandma.
#unknown [speaks Spanish] [speaking Spanish] Jesse, this is Brock.
#unknown So, you, uh You have a kid, huh? What's up? Brock, huh? That's a cool name.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Give it up.
#unknown Brock is almost 6.
#unknown You okay with kids? What? Yeah, he's cool.
#unknown Okay, Brock is gonna go play in his room while the big people talk.
#unknown He's gonna go play with his Legos and his cars Say "Bye, Jesse.
#unknown " Bye, Jesse.
#unknown Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking, and that man is neither.
#unknown I'll admit, he comes across like a circus clown.
#unknown But he actually knows what he's doing.
#unknown Safe and cautious is you not being involved in this at all.
#unknown Well, it's a little late on that.
#unknown This is what happens when you decide to pay our bills with drug money.
#unknown Skyler, this isn't just about what happened before.
#unknown My involvement in this is ongoing.
#unknown Understand? I can't just quit.
#unknown I have something of a contract.
#unknown It's all very safe and professional and structured.
#unknown I can't simply quit.
#unknown Where are you going? If you're gonna launder money, Walt, at least do it right.
#unknown You worked here four years.
#unknown It's a business you understand.
#unknown It's a story people will believe.
#unknown Not laser tag.
#unknown This.
#unknown This is what we buy.
#unknown You.
#unknown This is what you buy.
#unknown [muttering] Hey, uh, Jesse, right? Brandon.
#unknown Peter.
#unknown How goes it? Hanging in there? Please, just Dumb ass.
#unknown Sorry, man.
#unknown I was trying to keep it on the DL.
#unknown So you and that girl, you do the deed yet? Do what? You know, sell to her.
#unknown What are you two even doing here? What do you mean? You can't get your nut up to sell.
#unknown What's the point of even coming? Homie, I'm on, like, step 5.
#unknown Deuce, yo.
#unknown I'm catching up.
#unknown Whatever.
#unknown Later.
#unknown Dude needs to come into the fold.
#unknown [Badger] Yep.
#unknown Oh, you know, I have magical powers.
#unknown You want to see? Ready? That's not real.
#unknown [laughs] [whispers] It is real.
#unknown All right, do you want to see something that's real? Look at this.
#unknown Watch this.
#unknown Ready? You like that? That's science and stuff.
#unknown Makes it do that.
#unknown Do it again.
#unknown Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown Want to see it again? Could you do a trick with firecrackers? Firecrackers.
#unknown You know, I don't have any firecrackers on me.
#unknown Who does tricks with firecrackers? TomÃ¡s.
#unknown TomÃ¡s does tricks with firecrackers, huh? Who's TomÃ¡s? He's my kid brother.
#unknown Yeah? And we don't talk about him.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Eat your food, Brock.
#unknown [Jesse] Can I have a chip? I'm gonna steal your chip.
#unknown [Brock] Hey, that's mine.
#unknown [Saul] That's it? That's what you want to buy? [Walt] People will believe it at least.
#unknown [chuckles] I worked here for four years.
#unknown Wax on, wax off.
#unknown Was that you? Hey, how come you guys always get with the air freshener, huh? I explicitly say I want no air freshener, and every time I drive away smelling like an Alpine w3 house.
#unknown All due respect, I don't see it.
#unknown So I vote no.
#unknown Makes a better story than your laser tag.
#unknown Is that you talking or Yoko Ono? She has a point.
#unknown It makes more sense that I invest right here.
#unknown Based on her years of experience in money laundering, I suppose.
#unknown Let me tell you something.
#unknown If you're committed enough, you can make any story work.
#unknown I once convinced a woman that I was Kevin Costner.
#unknown And it worked because I believed it.
#unknown It has nothing to do with the story.
#unknown Besides, this dump isn't gonna work because it doesn't have a Danny.
#unknown Okay? There's no Danny here.
#unknown What in God's name is a Danny? Danny runs the laser tag.
#unknown Danny is the guy who had a vision.
#unknown Where others saw a dirt lot, he saw black lights, rubber aliens, teenagers running around with ray guns, right? It was like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.
#unknown And when the stock market took a shit and Danny got into trouble, he went searching for exactly the type of situation that we're offering.
#unknown Danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat.
#unknown In other words, Danny can be trusted completely.
#unknown That guy the guy with the eyebrows that won't quit is he a Danny? [no audible dialogue] You buy this place, all you got is a big building that squirts water.
#unknown You got no Danny here.
#unknown You want to stay for dinner? Yeah.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown What time is it? Early still.
#unknown So [chuckles] What? I thought maybe, if you're holding, we can do something.
#unknown What? You know, that blue stuff you were talking about? Maybe you had a line on some.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Whoa.
#unknown What? I thought you said the kid is coming home.
#unknown Yeah, in a few hours.
#unknown And you seriously want to get high? I don't know what you're getting so pissed about.
#unknown You're the one who brought it up the other day.
#unknown Yeah, that was before I found out you got a kid.
#unknown What kind of mother are you? What? You heard me.
#unknown What kind of mom gets wasted with a little kid to take care of? Nobody can say I don't take care of my son.
#unknown You gonna come in my house and judge me? Like you got no responsibility, so it's okay for you to get high.
#unknown Look, I What do you know about me? I take care of my baby.
#unknown I'll do anything for him.
#unknown The day Brock was born, I swore I won't let what happened to TomÃ¡s happen to my son.
#unknown I'll die first.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown I I just Look, I'll get out of here if you want.
#unknown That's what you want to do, then go.
#unknown It's not what I want.
#unknown Look, I was out of line talking about that stuff.
#unknown We both were.
#unknown You're right.
#unknown I don't know what you've been through.
#unknown You can tell me if you want.
#unknown This whole neighborhood is run by gangs.
#unknown They run the drugs, control the streets.
#unknown And they sort of took TomÃ¡s in.
#unknown No dad around.
#unknown they got TomÃ¡s slinging.
#unknown Part of some crew.
#unknown Then, when he was 10 for some initiation or something they made him kill somebody.
#unknown I heard the rumors.
#unknown I didn't believe it at first.
#unknown [exhales] But then I saw him, like, a weekater.
#unknown He told me, yeah, he did it.
#unknown They gave TomÃ¡s a gun.
#unknown Gave him a choice.
#unknown Him or some dude.
#unknown So he did it.
#unknown Told me all about it like it was nothing.
#unknown Who did he say he killed? Some dealer [smacks lips] from some outside crew.
#unknown Right around the corner from here, over off the Central.
#unknown Just rode up on his bike and shot him.
#unknown Off the Central? Like, over by the train tracks? When was this? A few months back.
#unknown What else did he tell you? He shot the guy right through the neck.
#unknown Shot him dead.
#unknown Just because he was working the wrong corner.
#unknown It won't happen again.
#unknown Not to my son.
#unknown [monitor beeping] Guess what.
#unknown People who say "Guess what" and then actually expect you to guess I hate those people.
#unknown Well, I just heard about a certain patient named SchradercommaHank who is going to be released at the end of this week.
#unknown Isn't that fantastic? Are they planning on rolling me out the front door at least, or they'll put me on a greased plank and, uh, slide me out the window? Hey.
#unknown Listen, I don't care what any damned insurance company thinks.
#unknown I'm not leaving here until I'm well.
#unknown Hank, this isn't about insurance.
#unknown I've talked to everybody, and they all say that you are healthy enough to go home.
#unknown Oh, I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
#unknown Hank, you get stronger every day.
#unknown You don't need to be in a hospital.
#unknown In this condition, yeah, I do.
#unknown You'll be just as comfortable at home as you are here.
#unknown You'll have all the same equipment All the same equipment? What The equipment does that mean? that you have here that you need.
#unknown Short term.
#unknown You'll do your PT at home, and it'll be great because you'll be home.
#unknown Wait till you see the bedroom.
#unknown I had them move the plasma in.
#unknown I know that's how you always wanted it, and you only had to get shot to get it, right? I got you a new bed.
#unknown A hospital bed? Well You put a hospital bed in my bedroom? Hank, you'll be home.
#unknown You get that out of my house.
#unknown You hear me, Marie? Today.
#unknown Hank I leave this hospital when I walk out of here, you understand? And not before.
#unknown [Skyler scoffs] What's a Danny? Danny is an accomplice, someone who's in on the scheme, who knows about laundering, who's paid to look the other way.
#unknown Now, while I agree with you that laser tag is a hard sell, without a Danny, the car wash isn't really an option.
#unknown And he can't get you another Danny to run the car wash? Easier said than done, if we're looking for someone trustworthy.
#unknown What about me? What about you? Me.
#unknown I'll be the Danny.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, Skyler.
#unknown That is not a good idea.
#unknown I'm perfectly capable of managing a small business.
#unknown A legal business, not this.
#unknown Who else could we trust? No.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown I'm in this.
#unknown And if I'm in it, I'm going to do it right.
#unknown You are not in this.
#unknown You are not We're married.
#unknown How am I not in this? We are not married, Skyler.
#unknown We're divorced.
#unknown Right? I never actually got around to filing the papers.
#unknown Married couples can't be compelled to testify against one another.
#unknown So there's that.
#unknown Jesse! Jesse.
#unknown Respirator.
#unknown Right.
#unknown [phone rings] [ring] [ring] [ring] Yes? Uhhuh.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'll be there.
#unknown What was that? An invitation.
#unknown [doorbell rings] Ah.
#unknown Walter.
#unknown You're right on time.
#unknown Please, come in.
#unknown I hope you like paila marina.
#unknown It's a fancy name for fish stew.
#unknown It sounds like a clichÃ©, but indeed, it's just like my mother used to make it.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown You can help me cook.
#unknown This is a Chilean dish that I love, but I never get to make it.
#unknown The kids won't eat it.
#unknown But, uh you know how that is.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Do you mind? Would you slice the garlic? Oh.
#unknown Very thin.
#unknown Why did you invite me here? We're working together.
#unknown Why not break bread together? Now the garlic.
#unknown Mm.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown It always amazes me the way the senses work in connection to memory.
#unknown I mean, this stew is simply an amalgam of ingredients.
#unknown Taken separately, these ingredients alone don't remind me of anything.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown [chuckling] Not very much at all.
#unknown But, in this precise combination, the smell of this meal instantly it brings me back to my childhood.
#unknown How is that possible? Basically, it all takes place in the hippocampus.
#unknown Neural connections are formed.
#unknown The senses make the neurons express signals that go right back to the same part of the brain as before, where memory is stored.
#unknown That's, uh, something called relational memory.
#unknown Uh don't quote me on that.
#unknown I I'm rusty on my biology.
#unknown That's very interesting.
#unknown Walter, I would like to help you, if I could.
#unknown Help me how? Well, when I first started out, I made a lot of mistakes.
#unknown [sigh] More than I care to admit.
#unknown I wish I'd had someone to advise me [chuckle] because this life of ours, it can overwhelm.
#unknown You are a wealthy man now.
#unknown And one must learn to be rich.
#unknown To be poor anyone can manage.
#unknown What advice do you have for me? Never make the same mistake twice.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown What's up? You, uh, you TomÃ¡s? Heard you were the man.
#unknown Yeah? What you want? Crystal.
#unknown You think you could hook me up? For a teenth? Shit, come on, yo.
#unknown Tch.
#unknown Hey, what's up? Hey.
#unknown [whistles] Bounce.
#unknown [breathing heavily]
