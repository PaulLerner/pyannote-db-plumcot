#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad Okay, boys! Take it all.
#unknown Let's get everything.
#unknown Put out the lighter.
#unknown He can't keep getting away with it! He won't.
#unknown Do you really want to burn him down? Let's do it together.
#unknown I put a wire on you, let him explain.
#unknown If I go to this plaza, I'm a dead man.
#unknown Next time I'm gonna get you where you really live.
#unknown Jesse, listen Todd, I think I might have another job for your uncle.
#unknown So, how big's the batch? Should be about 50 pounds, give or take.
#unknown Uncle Jack, that mask I think you should Mr.
#unknown White says the fumes aren't good to breathe.
#unknown Let me worry about what I breathe, kid.
#unknown Just hurry this up so I can grab a smoke.
#unknown Nice going, nephew.
#unknown Thanks, Uncle Jack.
#unknown Where is the blue? Where's the what? The blue color.
#unknown Does it come later, when this hardens? Where is it? I am correct in assuming this should be blue? See, I'm thinking the headline here should be "76%.
#unknown " Yeah.
#unknown Whole lot more than it was.
#unknown That dude who looked like Wolverine he couldn't crack 70.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Yes, percentagewise, it's marginally improved.
#unknown And congratulations, Todd.
#unknown But blue is our brand.
#unknown All over Europe, it's what our buyers pay top dollar for.
#unknown If we're down a bit in purity from the Heisenberg days, maybe they'll let us slide on that, but not if it's not blue.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown To my eye, it's kind of blue.
#unknown Yeah, a little.
#unknown It's blueish.
#unknown Todd, you're the chef.
#unknown What do you think? Yeah, kinda If it catches the light just right, I could see how you'd think there's a touch of blue, bluegreen in there.
#unknown Aquamarine.
#unknown Hell, we'll put food coloring in it.
#unknown Make it any damn shade you want.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Like they do farmraised salmon.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Jesus, you ever see how pink they make that crap? Like, flamingo pink.
#unknown It sure as hell don't come out the ocean lookin' like that.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let's make some money.
#unknown Here you go, Ms.
#unknown Quayle.
#unknown Lydia.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Is the tea okay? I made it just like you asked.
#unknown Mmhmm.
#unknown You sure? If it's too weak or something, I can go put another bag in it.
#unknown I'm sure.
#unknown Look, about the product I'm really sorry about the color.
#unknown For a minute or two, it just got a few degrees too hot in the mixing kettle, I think.
#unknown I might've just cooked the color right out of it.
#unknown You burned it, like a cake.
#unknown Yeah, sort of, I guess.
#unknown But the point is I think I can fix it, and I think I can bring the purity up too.
#unknown I mean, I'm doing everything just like Mr.
#unknown White taught me, so You know, it's bound to get better, right? I appreciate you making every possible effort, because, as you know, my buyers expect a certain threshold, a continuity.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Totally.
#unknown Uh, about your buyers I could ask my uncle to smooth things over with them, if you want.
#unknown I'll pass.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown I've put a lot of faith in your abilities, Todd.
#unknown I believe in you.
#unknown Please do make the cook better.
#unknown It's very important to me.
#unknown I've got a flight to catch.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown It's Walt.
#unknown Hey, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown How you doing? I'm okay.
#unknown I, uh Todd, I think I might have another job for your uncle.
#unknown Oh, okay.
#unknown Uh, you want me to set up a meeting? I Yes.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Let's do that.
#unknown Any headsup I should give him, like, um, which jail, how many targets, stuff like that?  Mr.
#unknown White?  Just one target.
#unknown Not currently in jail.
#unknown Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown I'm surprised you didn't strangle him.
#unknown So, now what? Book him? I'm sure the AUSA have plenty to say on how to play him against Walt.
#unknown Knowing what we know about how Walt deals with rats behind bars? No Yeah.
#unknown Punk has to be safer with the Marshals watching his back than out here where it's open season.
#unknown Mmmh What does that mean? What are you thinking? Kid's got an idea.
#unknown What kid? That kid? Timmy Dipshit there? The one that screwed up our sting? Oh, I'm all ears.
#unknown Just, uh, hear him out, will ya? Okay, genius, what's the idea? You guys need evidence to put him away, only he's too smart to leave any out there, right? So you say.
#unknown Well, I know some evidence that greedy asshole would never destroy.
#unknown His money.
#unknown You know where he keeps his money?  No.
#unknown But I know someone who might.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown How'd it go? Trailed him out to the dog house, picked him up there.
#unknown Seemed to be looking for someone.
#unknown Had a lot of questions.
#unknown No calls, though, right? You got his phone? Yeah.
#unknown He's on ice? The safe house off Rio Bravo.
#unknown I got Van Oster babysitting him.
#unknown Yeah, and what about Van Oster? Did he have any questions? Probably, but he knows better than to ask.
#unknown Good job.
#unknown I gotta tell you this up front, Hank.
#unknown If this guy decides that he wants to lawyer up, I don't care if you are my boss, I'm gonna put a stop to this.
#unknown He won't lawyer up.
#unknown What the hell, man? Ugh.
#unknown You're up.
#unknown Hey, there.
#unknown You mind taking it outside for a minute?  No, sir.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Huell Babineaux.
#unknown Know who I am? I'll take that as a yes.
#unknown Uh, thanks for your patience.
#unknown Uh, as, uh, Agent Gomez said, you're you're not under arrest.
#unknown Why am I here? Well, you're here, uh, for your own protection, sir.
#unknown How you figure that? Well, we both know how dangerous my brotherinlaw can be.
#unknown Nice poker face.
#unknown Look, uh, relax.
#unknown There's not much new you can tell me about Walter White.
#unknown Multiple murders, uh, ties to a white power prison gang, ran the largest meth racket in the entire Southwest.
#unknown I'm not asking, you're not answering.
#unknown Whoopdedoo.
#unknown Let's cut to the chase.
#unknown We have a wire on Walt's phone.
#unknown We intercepted a call between him and a certain Saul Goodman, esquire.
#unknown You know, your employer.
#unknown Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said that he was going to, quote, "Take care of one Jesse Pinkman," unquote, and that you were next on the hit list.
#unknown That's why you're here.
#unknown Bullshit.
#unknown That don't make no sense.
#unknown We got the recording.
#unknown I can I can let you hear it.
#unknown Your associate, Goodman's fixer What's his name? Some carrottop named Patrick Kuby.
#unknown Boston PD ran him out of Beantown a few years back.
#unknown Came out here for the sunshine.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Walt said he was gonna do this Kuby guy the same way he does you.
#unknown In fact, Kuby's already missing.
#unknown Sorry to say, things are looking grim for your your redheaded buddy.
#unknown Believe us, don't believe us.
#unknown Suit yourself.
#unknown Whatever you do, I would not call Goodman.
#unknown He sold you down the river bigtime.
#unknown The hell you talkin' about?  Oh, don't take it personally.
#unknown Goodman's next on the chopping block if he doesn't do what White says.
#unknown And to be fair, your, uh, circus clown of a boss did try to spare you for all of, what, about 15 seconds Before he decided to help Walt track you down.
#unknown You see, Goodman's got a trace on your phone, and as soon as you call him, uh, Walt's gonna find out where you're hiding out.
#unknown And then it's just a matter of time before you end up like this.
#unknown Oh, man.
#unknown Oh, man.
#unknown I swear to God, I didn't know he was gonna kill the man.
#unknown I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
#unknown I didn't know.
#unknown Relax.
#unknown I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
#unknown If we thought you did, you'd be in lockup for conspiracy to commit murder instead of here, under our protection.
#unknown So just tell us everything you know about White so we can get him before he gets you.
#unknown Why would he wanna kill me?  I ain't do nothin' to him.
#unknown Who knows with this guy? From what he said to Goodman, it may have something to do with him trying to tie up loose ends regarding his poisoning some kid named Brock.
#unknown Or maybe it's 'cause you know where his money is.
#unknown I don't know where his money is.
#unknown That ain't what we heard.
#unknown Well, you ain't listening to the people in the know.
#unknown Me and Kuby rented a van for the dude, loaded his cash up in a selfstorage unit, handed over the keys to him at Goodman's.
#unknown And who knows where he took it from there? A van, huh? How much money we talking? Seven barrels' worth.
#unknown Seven barrels? When you you say "barrels," you mean barrels barrels? Barrels, man.
#unknown You know, plastic, black, I got 'em at Home Depot.
#unknown Filled up every last damn one of 'em too.
#unknown And, uh, where did you rent the van? Lariat.
#unknown The one on Candelaria and Monroe.
#unknown Lariat on Candelaria?  Yeah! Kuby rented the van.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White dropped it off.
#unknown He had us wash it good before Kuby took it back.
#unknown Wash the rental? Why? It was filthy, man, like he had went off road with it.
#unknown After we had hosed it down, he grabbed a shovel out the back, handed over the key, and that was it.
#unknown That's all I know.
#unknown All right, uh, Mr.
#unknown Babineaux.
#unknown Agent Gomez and I are going to, uh, do everything we can to find the son of a bitch.
#unknown Meantime, like I said, you're free to go.
#unknown But if I were you, I wouldn't take one step out that door.
#unknown Right.
#unknown And remember, no phone calls.
#unknown Oh, almost forgot.
#unknown Uh, I took the liberty of removing the battery so Walt can't, uh, track you by GPS.
#unknown So don't put that back in.
#unknown Agent Van Oster will stay here with you.
#unknown You're in good hands.
#unknown He's our best man with a gun.
#unknown Uh, however, don't discuss the case with him, because the less you distract him, the better he can protect you.
#unknown How long you gonna be? As long as it takes to keep you safe.
#unknown So just one guy this time.
#unknown Not even in lockup.
#unknown Some former partner, Todd says? Yeah.
#unknown So what are we talking, rat patrol? "Rat p" No, no.
#unknown "Rat patrol"? No.
#unknown No, he's not a rat.
#unknown He's just He he just won't listen to reason.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown He's just angry.
#unknown He's not a rat.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Angry, nonrat.
#unknown Got it.
#unknown How angry we talkin', by the way? Like, Hulk angry? Like, "Rambo James Bond badass" individual? Not something you'd do yourself, huh? Jesse is like family to me.
#unknown Look, I want what you do to be quick and painless.
#unknown No suffering, no fear.
#unknown Bullet to the back of the head.
#unknown Something he doesn't see coming.
#unknown I respect that.
#unknown There's too many savages out there.
#unknown Let's just talk about the money.
#unknown No, we don't want your money.
#unknown We want you to cook for us.
#unknown You know I'm out of the business.
#unknown Just a couple times to tutor my nephew here, that's all.
#unknown Get him on track to bringing the purity up.
#unknown Get the color right too.
#unknown Apparently that blue touch you put on it it's all the craze with those Slavic types.
#unknown So I'm told.
#unknown No.
#unknown Absolutely not.
#unknown Look, what was the price per head last time? I'll triple it.
#unknown That's a drop in the bucket compared to what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.
#unknown Don't skimp on family.
#unknown That's what I always say.
#unknown You want us to do this job? Do it right? That's the price.
#unknown One cook after the job is done.
#unknown Time is of the essence.
#unknown Do you understand? We'll do him tonight if you want.
#unknown Just tell me where he is.
#unknown I don't know where he is, but I know how to flush him out.
#unknown You want String Cheese or Yogurt Squeezers with your PBJ? Both.
#unknown I didn't hear you.
#unknown Both, please.
#unknown Hold on, honey.
#unknown Hi, Andrea.
#unknown I don't know if you remember me.
#unknown I'm Walter White, Jesse's friend.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown Yeah, of course.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Oh, hi.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown I'm sorry to just barge in on you like this, but, uh, I was hoping that I could have a moment to talk with you.
#unknown It's about Jesse.
#unknown Um, okay.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown But I'm sort of rushing around right now.
#unknown You wanna talk inside while I get my boy ready for school? Uh, well, yeah.
#unknown If it's if it's okay, yeah, sure.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You met Brock before, right? Yes.
#unknown Yes, I have.
#unknown At Jesse's.
#unknown How you doing, Brock? Brock, he asked you a question.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Froot Loops.
#unknown That's good stuff.
#unknown So Jesse.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I I don't wanna alarm you, but I've I've been trying to reach him for days.
#unknown I've stopped at his house.
#unknown I've left all kinds of messages on his voicemail, and he won't return my calls.
#unknown I can't find him anywhere.
#unknown Have you heard from him? No, not since the last time he called to check on Brock.
#unknown That was I don't know two weeks ago, maybe.
#unknown Andrea Jesse's using again, and I I I have a bad feeling about this.
#unknown Have you tried calling the police? Or, um a better idea.
#unknown Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
#unknown I have his card somewhere.
#unknown I mean, he may have ways of finding Jesse without, you know, getting him in trouble.
#unknown "Better Call Saul.
#unknown " Yeah.
#unknown I I did that.
#unknown He was able to verify that Jesse's not locked up.
#unknown But otherwise, very little help.
#unknown See, the thing is is that Jesse and I had this argument recently.
#unknown And I I won't bore you with the details, but, uh, he's he's he's pretty upset with me, and, uh and I'm hoping that's the reason he hasn't called me back instead of him being Well Well, I'll try him right now.
#unknown I mean, if that's it he's mad at you, maybe I'll have better luck.
#unknown That would be such a help.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown What, um what what number are you, uh, calling him on?  Um, his cell.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You know, he recently gotten a new one.
#unknown And there.
#unknown That that's his new number there the highlighted one.
#unknown Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.
#unknown Your friend Walter just dropped by.
#unknown He's here at the house with me and Brock right now.
#unknown We, uh we're thinking of you.
#unknown Call me back as soon as you get this message, okay? I really need to hear from you.
#unknown It's important.
#unknown Thank you, Andrea.
#unknown I appreciate that.
#unknown Well, I better I better be going.
#unknown Oh, you're welcome to stay a few minutes to see if he calls back.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown You're trying to get your son off to school.
#unknown Listen, if he does happen to call back, would you call me? Better yet I've got your number.
#unknown I'll call you back, okay? And thank you.
#unknown See ya, Brock.
#unknown We on? Yes.
#unknown It should be any time now.
#unknown Copy that.
#unknown Remember, fast and painless.
#unknown And take him away from here.
#unknown I don't want the mother or the boy to know.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.
#unknown Your friend Walter just dropped by.
#unknown He's here at the house with me and Brock right now.
#unknown We, uh we're thinking of you.
#unknown Call me back as soon as you get this message, okay? I really need to hear from you.
#unknown It's important.
#unknown Nice try, asshole.
#unknown How'd it go at the rental place? Van have GPS? No GPS.
#unknown Nope.
#unknown They used to have GPS until about six months ago, when the ACLU or somebody sued them, and they had to get rid of it.
#unknown Well, that's it.
#unknown Game over.
#unknown Yo, man, you can't just give up on this.
#unknown Who said we're giving up?  What do you got? Just thinking about what Babineaux said about the van being dirty and the shovel that Walt had with him.
#unknown I'll bet you 10to1 he buried that money.
#unknown No kidding.
#unknown So what? There's a whole lot of desert out there.
#unknown How are we gonna find the right spot? You said it yourself, there's no GPS on the van.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown But Walt doesn't know that.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Here's your change.
#unknown Oh, um, count it out, please.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Uh, three.
#unknown That makes 15.
#unknown Plus five.
#unknown That is 20.
#unknown Give this to your car wash professional.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Say it.
#unknown Have an A1 day.
#unknown Oh, you too.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Why why do I why do I gotta say that? Because it reinforces our brand.
#unknown So, getting the hang of it? It's, uh it's it's pretty basic.
#unknown Mom, it's Saturday.
#unknown Can can I go?  Go where?  Home.
#unknown Um, pick up a few things, maybe chill for a little bit.
#unknown I'm sure the smell is gone by now.
#unknown Why don't you just stick around here for a while longer, all right?  I need you.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Uh, who do I give this to? Um, you know what? I'll take care of it.
#unknown Excuse me, son.
#unknown That'll be 14.
#unknown 97, please.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown How you doin'? Yyou're on our billboard.
#unknown You're  you're the lawyer guy.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown "Better call Saul!" Okay.
#unknown So, three makes 15, and 20, 25, 30, Thank you.
#unknown I like your commercial.
#unknown What what happened to your face? Uh, this is a I guess you'd call it an occupational hazard.
#unknown Okay, so thank you, and please give that to your car wash professional.
#unknown Very good.
#unknown Thank you very much.
#unknown Good to meet you.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Don't drink and drive.
#unknown But if you do, call me.
#unknown Have an A1 day.
#unknown Mom, you, um you forgot to say it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, I did.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Make sure you get in there between the cushions, all right? That's it.
#unknown Way in there.
#unknown Attaboy.
#unknown What the hell you doing here? I swear to God, the kid left so much booger powder in there, my Caddy is a K9 unit's wet dream.
#unknown Is your phone broken? All 200 of them? Huell's gone.
#unknown Huell's gone where? No idea.
#unknown AWOL.
#unknown Nobody's seen him.
#unknown He's not answering his phone.
#unknown So what about Jesse? He hasn't shown up yet.
#unknown He will, Saul.
#unknown He's probably high as a kite somewhere and hasn't gotten our message yet.
#unknown Or he got it loud and clear and figured out it's a setup.
#unknown The kid is not as dumb as you think.
#unknown Are you wearing a bulletproof vest? Did you miss the part about my bodyguard has gone missing? Look, I had him watching the dog house, figuring the kid might show up for a fix.
#unknown Next thing I know, radio silence.
#unknown You're the math whiz.
#unknown Add up two and two.
#unknown Jesse is not on some killing spree.
#unknown It's me he wants.
#unknown It's just me.
#unknown Then where the hell's Huell? Any news? Not yet, but soon.
#unknown I promise.
#unknown Have an A1 day.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Next inventory lists.
#unknown uh, ten pinescented air fresheners.
#unknown You mark "ten" under this column, and then you subtract ten from the actual stock column here.
#unknown Okay? Why don't you try that? Jesse? Got my photo, bitch? That barrel look familiar? 'Cause I just found six more exactly like it.
#unknown That big bastard who works for Goodman I pistolwhipped that melon he calls a head till he gave up what he knew, which led me to your rental van, which, it turns out, had GPS.
#unknown How do you like that, genius? Guess you didn't think of everything.
#unknown Look, Jesse, I don't know what you plan on doing here, but Well, I'll give you a hint, Walt.
#unknown It involves a couple of fivegallon cans of gasoline and a lighter.
#unknown No, no, no, no, no! Jesse, please, listen to me.
#unknown No, you listen to me, bitch! You get your ass out here as fast as you can.
#unknown Yes, I'm coming! Okay? Okay! And don't even think about calling anyone for help, all right? You hang up on me, put me on hold, I lose my call for any reason, as soon as you do, I'm burning all of it.
#unknown All right? One big bonfire.
#unknown You get the picture? I get it.
#unknown I get it.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Well, you better hurry, 'cause I'm burning ten grand a minute till you get here, starting right now.
#unknown I said I'm coming! Don't you touch my money! Fire in the hole, bitch.
#unknown There goes ten G's.
#unknown Aw, nice orange flames.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, no, no, no, no! Jesse Jesse, please.
#unknown I'm dying.
#unknown My cancer is back.
#unknown You're not hurting anyone but my family.
#unknown Okay? Look, I I can't spend this money.
#unknown It's not for me.
#unknown I won't be around long enough to use it.
#unknown It belongs to my children.
#unknown Oh, you're gonna talk about kids.
#unknown You're seriously gonna go there? I am sorry about Brock.
#unknown No, you're not.
#unknown I am.
#unknown You're not, but you're gonna be.
#unknown Yes, I am sorry about Brock! But he's alive, isn't he? He's fine, just as I planned it! Don't you think I knew exactly how much to give him? That I had it all measured out? Come on!  Don't you know me by now?  I know you're a lying, evil scumbag, that's what I know.
#unknown Manipulating people,  messing with their heads.
#unknown Open your eyes! Can't you see that I needed you on my side to kill Gus? I ran over those gangbangers! I killed Emilio and Krazy8! Why? I did all of those things to try to save your life as much as mine, only you're too stupid to know it! Jesse Jesse! Jesse, talk to me.
#unknown Jesse! Jesse, I didn't hang up! Jesse! Jesse? Jesse, I'm here.
#unknown Where are you? Son of a bitch.
#unknown Son of a bitch.
#unknown Son of a bitch! No.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Come on, come on.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yeah? It's me.
#unknown I've got Jesse in sight, and he's coming for me right now.
#unknown He knows I'm alone.
#unknown I'm guessing he's got backup.
#unknown How many guys?  I don I I don't know.
#unknown Where are you?  Tohajiilee.
#unknown Indian reservation, west of town.
#unknown Get a pen.
#unknown Go.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown "34, 59, 20, 106, 36, 52.
#unknown " Those are coordinates.
#unknown If you want me around to cook for you,  you get here right now.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown As fast as you can.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown They're coming.
#unknown It looks like there could be three men total.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown What? What is it? Stay in the car.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Walter, what is it? Walter, you still there? Walter! Walter, you got eyes on him? What do you see? Walter, talk to me.
#unknown Forget it.
#unknown Don't come.
#unknown What do you mean, "Don't come"? It's off.
#unknown Do not come.
#unknown Walt! Come on out! Walt! Walt! I know you're out here! It's over! Walt! Come on out, Walt! Got him.
#unknown Drop it! Hands up! Walk towards me slowly! Stop.
#unknown Turn around.
#unknown Lace your fingers behind your head.
#unknown Walk backwards to me.
#unknown Stop.
#unknown Get on your knees.
#unknown How'd you like my barrel photo, huh? Took it in the backyard by the barbecue grill.
#unknown You know, where we used to cook out with the family.
#unknown Gomie thought the dirt might not match.
#unknown But me? I bet your greedy ass would be so worked up about the prospect of losing your cash that you wouldn't catch it.
#unknown Looks like I was right.
#unknown He's clean.
#unknown Yo, I remember this place.
#unknown The very first place we cooked, like, ever.
#unknown It is, isn't it? Hey, uh, what say you save us the busywork, Walt, and point out the spot where you buried your money? No? No matter.
#unknown I'll get a search team out here.
#unknown We'll find it.
#unknown Agent Gomez, shall we flip a coin for the honors? No way, man.
#unknown It's all yours.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Walter White, you have the right to remain silent.
#unknown Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
#unknown You have the right to speak to an attorney and have an attorney present during any questioning.
#unknown If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you at the government's expense.
#unknown Do you understand these rights as I have just recited them to you? Coward.
#unknown Back off! Back off! Get over here! Get over here!  Get in the truck!  Bring it, bitch!  Put him in the car!  Come on! Get in the car! Hurry up! Get in.
#unknown Get in the car, kid.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Gonna take him down for booking, okay? I think you should stay here till I come back with a search team.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown I'd take the kid with me, but they'd probably kill each other on the way.
#unknown Congratulations, buddy.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I'll call the Tribal Police on the way out, let 'em know we're here.
#unknown Gonna make a phone call.
#unknown Hank, why is there what looks like brains in our garbage can? Hey, baby.
#unknown I got him.
#unknown Dead to rights.
#unknown You got Walt? Yeah.
#unknown I got him in handcuffs as we speak.
#unknown Want me to wave to him for you? Huh? Well, he's not, uh he's not feeling too friendly.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown You did it.
#unknown Thank God.
#unknown Things are gonna be a little rough for the next couple weeks, but they'll get better.
#unknown Baby, you okay? I'm much better now.
#unknown I gotta go.
#unknown It may be awhile before I get home.
