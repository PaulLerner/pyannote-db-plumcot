hank_schrader  All right, everybody.
hank_schrader  Listen up.
hank_schrader  Tuco Salamanca.
hank_schrader  those of you who were not with us this morning we raided his headquarters.
hank_schrader  Also his lastknown address.
hank_schrader  Even the little den of iniquity he keeps for his methhag girlfriend.
hank_schrader  We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
hank_schrader  The man himself smelled us coming.
hank_schrader  So study the face.
hank_schrader  Study the file.
hank_schrader  Get a big old raging hardon at the idea of catching this piece of shit.
hank_schrader  apologies to the H. R. department.
hank_schrader  Grow tumescent with anticipation.
hank_schrader  right.
hank_schrader  On the hit parade, 1998.
hank_schrader  Reputed to have whacked one" Dog" Paulson back when our bandidos were wresting the crank trade away from the SoCal biker gangs.
hank_schrader  Also, we're pretty sure he knifed a Mexican national in '03. And
hank_schrader  for my money, seeing how he customarily deals with rivals l'd say he is a prime suspect in the disappearance of our dearly missed Krazy8.
hank_schrader  Hats over your heart for that dirtball.
steven_gomez  We hauled Tuco in for questioning on that but we couldn't make it stick.
hank_schrader  Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
hank_schrader  Smug bastard.
steven_gomez  And even worse, El Paso says he's got some kind of cartel connection.
hank_schrader  Yeah, yeah.
hank_schrader  I know.
hank_schrader  We all know what's going on down there.
hank_schrader  We sure don't want it going on up here which brings us to the good news.
hank_schrader  We finally got some actual, honesttoGod evidence. This is one
hank_schrader  of Tuco's henchmen.
hank_schrader  Street name : NoDoze.
hank_schrader  Found him tucked in the junkyard along with Tuco's own brotherinlaw a. k. a. Gonzo.
hank_schrader  Gonzo, this rocket scientist, was moving NoDoze's body
hank_schrader  Either hiding it there or pulling it
hank_schrader  it out. Not sure.
hank_schrader  when he got his arm crushed clean off.
hank_schrader  Anyone wanna see the photos, they're on my website.
hank_schrader  Hilarious.
hank_schrader  Anyway.
hank_schrader  The upshot is we got us a nice, big, juicy, bloody fingerprint which belongs to Senor Tuco.
hank_schrader  Christmas came early to the Schrader household.
hank_schrader  That is, provided we find this guy.
hank_schrader  So to all present, I ask you, you wanna find this guy? Yes.
unknown  What
hank_schrader  hell was that?
hank_schrader  Jesus.
hank_schrader  Wanna try that again?
hank_schrader  Do you wanna find this guy?
unknown  Yes!
hank_schrader  Are we going to find this guy?
hank_schrader  Yes
unknown  Yes!
Hank_Schrader  They ain't gonna find him. Guy is in Mexico by now.
hank_schrader  Appearances, Gomey.
hank_schrader  It's all about appearances.
hank_schrader  Listen, I gotta take some personal time.
steven_gomez  Now, in the middle of a manhunt?
hank_schrader  Skyler called last night.
hank_schrader  It's Walt.
hank_schrader  He's missing.
hank_schrader  Just disappeared from the house, and no one's heard from him since.

skyler_white  Some detail that we haven't picked up on.

marie_schrader  We can't just ignore a potential clue, Hank. Okay.
skyler_white  What are you talking about?
hank_schrader  The call you said Walt got before he disappeared?
hank_schrader  There's no record of it with the phone company.
hank_schrader  No incoming, no dropped calls, nothing.
skyler_white  But his phone rang.
skyler_white  I heard it.

hank_schrader  Okay.
hank_schrader  I'm not here to argue with you.

skyler_white  What does it mean?
hank_schrader  don't know, Sky. What
hank_schrader  What do you want me to say?

skyler_white  Everyone.
skyler_white  Okay.
marie_schrader  Skyler, come on.
marie_schrader  He kept cancer from you for weeks.
skyler_white  Okay, then, let's assume there's a second cell phone.
skyler_white  So what?
skyler_white  What, is he having an affair?
marie_schrader  Walt?
marie_schrader  Please.
marie_schrader  What about the marijuana?
skyler_white  He's not on pot anymore.
marie_schrader  Says who?
marie_schrader  Him?
marie_schrader  Chemotherapy and marijuana go together like apple pie and Chevrolet.
marie_schrader  Maybe he's addicted to the pot and he owes his drug dealer a lot of money.
skyler_white  Marie, you don't get hooked on pot like that.
marie_schrader  How do you know?
marie_schrader  You didn't even know he had a second cell phone.
marie_schrader  Hank, you have to question this drugdealer person.
marie_schrader  He may know something.
hank_schrader  Well, I'm telling you, we're grasping at straws here.
marie_schrader  Then grasp.
hank_schrader  Excuse me, ma'am.
hank_schrader  Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
hank_schrader  He around?
mrs._pinkman  No.
mrs._pinkman  I'm afraid not.
mrs._pinkman  Why?
hank_schrader  I'm sorry.
hank_schrader  Hank Schrader.
hank_schrader  I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse about my brotherinlaw, Walter White.
hank_schrader  He taught your son chemistry in high school.
mrs._pinkman  Oh, Mr. White. Yes
mrs._pinkman  Yes, I remember him.
mrs._pinkman  a long time ago.
hank_schrader  Yes, ma'am.
hank_schrader  It's my understanding that he and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.
mrs._pinkman  Really?
mrs._pinkman  Mr. White must've seen some potential in Jesse. He
mrs._pinkman  He really tried to motivate him.
mrs._pinkman  He was one of the few teachers who cared.
hank_schrader  Yeah, Walt's that way.
hank_schrader  He's a good man.
mrs._pinkman  I'm so sorry to hear about his illness.
mrs._pinkman  Please pass along our best wishes.
hank_schrader  I certainly will, as soon as he turns up.
hank_schrader  He's missing, actually.
hank_schrader  Just kind of walked off,
hank_schrader  Anyway, which is why I'm going around trying to think of anyone who knows him, even slightly.
mrs._pinkman  That's terrible.
mrs._pinkman  Anything we can do to help.
hank_schrader  Well, if you could put me in touch with your son.
hank_schrader  I said, we're kind of desperate for leads.
hank_schrader  Jesse's not answering either number, and no one seems to be at his house.
mrs._pinkman  And why do you think my son and Mr. White would be in touch?
hank_schrader  I don't necessarily.
hank_schrader  I just
mrs._pinkman  Are you with the police?
hank_schrader  No, ma'am.
hank_schrader  Not at all
hank_schrader  I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration.
mrs._pinkman  God.
mrs._pinkman  my son in trouble?
hank_schrader  I have absolutely no reason to think that, no.
mrs._pinkman  Do I need to get a lawyer?
mrs._pinkman  You know, you don't seem very forthright about this coming here and asking questions about my son and Mrs
hank_schrader  Mrs. Pinkman, I'm not here on official capacity.
hank_schrader  I do not care what your son may or may not have done wrong.
hank_schrader  I just wanna find my brotherinlaw.
hank_schrader  His wife is worried sick, and she's got a baby on the way.
mrs._pinkman  I'm sorry.
mrs._pinkman  I would like to help you but I have not seen my son in over a month.
mrs._pinkman  I don't expect to see him anytime soon.
hank_schrader  Well, thanks for your
hank_schrader  you could tell me one more thing.
hank_schrader  Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy Monte Carlo, as far as you know?
mrs._pinkman  If he had spent half as much time and money on his education as he has on that ridiculous bouncing car
hank_schrader  Low rider, huh?
hank_schrader  Gomey, hey.
hank_schrader  No, nothing yet. Hey
hank_schrader  Hey, listen, do me a solid and check out a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.
hank_schrader  Specifically, I wanna know if the car's got a LoJack.
hank_schrader  It's one of those jackoff low riders, so I'm betting there is.
hank_schrader  If so, can you go ahead and get me a fix on it?
hank_schrader  Thanks, buddy.
walter_white  already tell you how moronic that was?
jesse_pinkman  At least
jesse_pinkman  tried something. Hey
jesse_pinkman  it almost worked too.
jesse_pinkman  How's about you leaving my gun, huh?
jesse_pinkman  First you boost it, then you leave it in your house
jesse_pinkman  My
walter_white  was I supposed to know you were chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?
jesse_pinkman  Well, at least he wants you alive.
walter_white  Hey, I don't get it. If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo, then who did? I don't know. I don't know. Does it really matter? If he finds out that Gonzo is dead and not a police informant who does he automatically blame? Us. We need a plan. Think, think. Let's just bumrush him, man. You crack him over the head with something and I'll go for his gun. Crack him over the head with
jesse_pinkman  Hey
jesse_pinkman  Hey, you got the Cbomb, man, all right?
jesse_pinkman  You're as good as checked out already.
jesse_pinkman  Okay?
jesse_pinkman  You should be, like, all sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.
walter_white  my life is not the priority here because I'm gonna be dead soon anyway.
jesse_pinkman  That's
jesse_pinkman  don't much like the taste of chilli P. That
jesse_pinkman  That much has been established.
jesse_pinkman  unless you can convince him to booty bump.
tuco_salamanca  We got a long ride ahead of us.
tuco_salamanca  Go on, sit.

tuco_salamanca  I don't want you to go belly up before we get there.
Tuco_Salamanca  Take it easy, Tio.

tuco_salamanca  I eat first.
tuco_salamanca  That's the deal.

walter_white  No, l Maybe it was I did change the channel on his TV, but.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, that's it. While
jesse_pinkman  While you were cooking he was watching one of those telenovels with all those ripe honeys on it.
jesse_pinkman  He was really into it
jesse_pinkman  it. I told you not to change the channel.
jesse_pinkman  You know, dude needs his eye candy.
jesse_pinkman  That's it.
