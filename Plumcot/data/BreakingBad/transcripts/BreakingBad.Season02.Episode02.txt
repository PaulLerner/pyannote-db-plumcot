#unknown All right, everybody.
#unknown Listen up.
#unknown Tuco Salamanca.
#unknown For those of you who were not with us this morning we raided his headquarters.
#unknown Also his lastknown address.
#unknown Even the little den of iniquity he keeps for his methhag girlfriend.
#unknown We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
#unknown The man himself smelled us coming.
#unknown So study the face.
#unknown Study the file.
#unknown Get a big old raging hardon at the idea of catching this piece of shit.
#unknown My apologies to the H.
#unknown R.
#unknown department.
#unknown Grow tumescent with anticipation.
#unknown All right.
#unknown On the hit parade, 1998.
#unknown Reputed to have whacked one " Dog" Paulson back when our bandidos were wresting the crank trade away from the SoCal biker gangs.
#unknown Also, we're pretty sure he knifed a Mexican national in '03.
#unknown And for my money, seeing how he customarily deals with rivals l'd say he is a prime suspect in the disappearance of our dearly missed Krazy8.
#unknown Hats over your heart for that dirtball.
#unknown We hauled Tuco in for questioning on that but we couldn't make it stick.
#unknown Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
#unknown Smug bastard.
#unknown And even worse, El Paso says he's got some kind of cartel connection.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown I know.
#unknown We all know what's going on down there.
#unknown We sure don't want it going on up here which brings us to the good news.
#unknown We finally got some actual, honesttoGod evidence.
#unknown This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
#unknown Street name: NoDoze.
#unknown Found him tucked in the junkyard along with Tuco's own brotherinlaw a.
#unknown k.
#unknown a.
#unknown Gonzo.
#unknown Gonzo, this rocket scientist, was moving NoDoze's body Either hiding it there or pulling it out.
#unknown Not sure.
#unknown when he got his arm crushed clean off.
#unknown Anyone wanna see the photos, they're on my website.
#unknown Hilarious.
#unknown Anyway.
#unknown The upshot is we got us a nice, big, juicy, bloody fingerprint which belongs to Senor Tuco.
#unknown Christmas came early to the Schrader household.
#unknown That is, provided we find this guy.
#unknown So to all present, I ask you, you wanna find this guy? Yes.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown What the hell was that? Jesus.
#unknown Wanna try that again? Do you wanna find this guy? Yes! Are we going to find this guy? Yes! Louder, damn it! Yes! Give me a " hell, yeah!" Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah.
#unknown Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.
#unknown They ain't gonna find him.
#unknown Guy is in Mexico by now.
#unknown Appearances, Gomey.
#unknown It's all about appearances.
#unknown Listen, I gotta take some personal time.
#unknown Now, in the middle of a manhunt? Skyler called last night.
#unknown It's Walt.
#unknown He's missing.
#unknown Just disappeared from the house, and no one's heard from him since.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown You don't think he? Holler if you need me.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Thanks a lot, man.
#unknown Appreciate that.
#unknown This is the most recent photo.
#unknown We haven't taken many lately, so.
#unknown But that's what he looks like now.
#unknown Without the hair.
#unknown Hey, it's me.
#unknown Hey, Tim.
#unknown Really appreciate you sparing us your day off.
#unknown No worries.
#unknown Happy to help.
#unknown Yeah, this is helpful.
#unknown Good.
#unknown What about height and weight? Five eleven most recently, about 170.
#unknown One sixtyfive.
#unknown That's what I weigh.
#unknown I guess he weighs a little less.
#unknown That's fine.
#unknown That's close enough.
#unknown Good.
#unknown What about other distinguishing features? Tattoos or moles or scars? Anything that might help us.
#unknown Tattoos? No.
#unknown Not really.
#unknown No.
#unknown That's fine.
#unknown Is that the list of medications? Yes.
#unknown I wrote them all down.
#unknown And there's no drug interactions.
#unknown None that are listed.
#unknown I called his doctor, so, no.
#unknown Has he been depressed? He's been withdrawn lately.
#unknown A little withdrawn.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Last night, he was agitated.
#unknown Agitated? Yeah.
#unknown When he came home last night, he was agitated, upset.
#unknown Upset in general? Or upset because of something particular? When I asked him what was wrong, he said: " I don't know where to begin.
#unknown " Then he just walked out of the room Out of the bathroom.
#unknown I was in the tub, taking a bath.
#unknown and when I came out about 10 minutes later, he was gone.
#unknown Nothing else missing? His keys, wallet, cell phone.
#unknown Just what was on him.
#unknown But What about the phone call? I'm looking into it.
#unknown What phone call? Walt's cell phone rang.
#unknown He pulled it out, looked at it, and didn't answer it.
#unknown But then, a short time after, he wandered out of the bathroom.
#unknown I mean couldn't that be important, right? Anything else you can think of? Anything else.
#unknown No.
#unknown I called the credit card providers and there's no report of any recent activity.
#unknown l Let's see.
#unknown I checked with every hospital within 50 miles.
#unknown Every police station.
#unknown Every morgue.
#unknown So, no, I really don't I don't have anything else.
#unknown I was actually hoping that you had something else being that you're the expert.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown No worries.
#unknown I think this is good enough to start.
#unknown Gives us plenty to work on.
#unknown Mrs.
#unknown White.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Walter.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown So that cellphone call she's talking about? I ran it.
#unknown And? Never happened.
#unknown No record of it.
#unknown Second cell phone.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm thinking.
#unknown I understand.
#unknown Out.
#unknown Get away from me! Settle down, bitch.
#unknown You gonna shoot me, huh? Shoot me in here! I hope I bleed like a mother too! That way, you have to clean it up! It's your ride, retard.
#unknown I ain't gotta clean jack.
#unknown Now, get out.
#unknown Get up.
#unknown Get up.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Don't do this, Tuco.
#unknown No more posters? Walter Jr.
#unknown 's making more.
#unknown Thank you, Marie.
#unknown I don't think he'll hurt himself.
#unknown I mean, he just doesn't strike me as the type.
#unknown He'll turn up.
#unknown Okay, the whole tiara thing I just find it bewildering that Marie.
#unknown you didn't believe that Marie.
#unknown Not now.
#unknown Empty your pockets.
#unknown Thought your name was Heisenberg "Walter Hartwell White.
#unknown " Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.
#unknown You know, a business name.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I like doing business with a family man.
#unknown There's always a lot of collateral.
#unknown Answer me one thing.
#unknown Can I trust you? Yes.
#unknown Yes, absolutely.
#unknown Sit down.
#unknown DEA hit my place of business this morning.
#unknown About a hundred cops looking for me.
#unknown You two haven't been talking, right? No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Picked up my whole crew, top to bottom.
#unknown Everybody except Gonzo.
#unknown That's weird, right? I mean, don't you think that that's weird? It's weird.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Unusual.
#unknown Unusual.
#unknown Last two days, I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.
#unknown He's been acting all pouty on account of NoDoze.
#unknown Explain to me.
#unknown How is it my fault that that little bitch did not know his place? I saw this coming.
#unknown I can see the future, you know? It's this gift that I have deep inside my head.
#unknown I knew last night they were gonna come try and bust me.
#unknown Gonzo.
#unknown He went and snitched to the cops! That lousy son of a bitch! I trusted him like a brother! I was good to him! I was good! I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him, I'm gonna skin him and I'm gonna stuff his hide for a heavy bag and every time I hit him, it's gonna be like a lesson to myself! You never, never trust the people that you love! So you plan to ice Gonzo, like, future tense? What? You're saying, Tuco.
#unknown You're saying that Gonzo is currently operating as a police informant as far as you know? I'm very sorry to hear that.
#unknown That's disappointing.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'd waste him too, yo.
#unknown Shut up.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown They're out there looking for me right now.
#unknown They got ghetto birds and black ops.
#unknown I need to get high.
#unknown I need to get good and high.
#unknown What's with this gak? It smells like headcheese.
#unknown No, it's It's killer.
#unknown Yeah, seriously.
#unknown So I was thinking last night.
#unknown I came up with this great idea.
#unknown Mexico? We'll disappear way out in the jungle.
#unknown We'll set you up in a superlab.
#unknown We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.
#unknown And no Federales are gonna mess with us because I got my people there.
#unknown Connections.
#unknown We're going to make beaucoup bucks, Heisenberg, huh? Tuco, I.
#unknown I have a wife and family.
#unknown So what? You'll get another one.
#unknown I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I can't just uproot my life like that.
#unknown Yeah, man.
#unknown I mean, me neither.
#unknown Who's talking to you? You need me, man because I cooked that scante in your hands.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'll tell you something, yo.
#unknown You never tried nothing like it.
#unknown Stink or no stink one bump, you'll be flying high for days.
#unknown It's a new product him and I've been working up.
#unknown Careful when you hit it.
#unknown It kicks like a 12 gauge when it comes on.
#unknown It's got a secret ingredient.
#unknown What secret ingredient? Chilli powder.
#unknown I hate chilli powder.
#unknown This blue magic, this is money.
#unknown You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.
#unknown We're gonna rewrite history with this.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Time to clean the menudo out from between your ears.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown No, I need him, Tuco.
#unknown I need him very, very badly.
#unknown He's my partner.
#unknown And if he doesn't go, I don't go.
#unknown I'll tell you this.
#unknown My cousins are driving up here right now to smuggle us back, and they're gonna be here by sunset and you're gonna be on that truck, or you're gonna be dead! And you.
#unknown You better hope they got room in the trunk.
#unknown Where are you going? Louis is taking me to the train station.
#unknown We'll put these up.
#unknown No, no, honey.
#unknown No, I'll do it.
#unknown He wants to help, let him help.
#unknown I mean, how long has it been since you've slept? Yeah, she's right, Sky.
#unknown Why don't you lay down a while? For chrissake, you got a bun in the oven.
#unknown I got my cell if you need me.
#unknown Okay? Okay.
#unknown Bye, sweetie.
#unknown I'll see you later.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Actually, I think the very fact they haven't found him yet bodes well.
#unknown Well, I mean, if he You know.
#unknown Somebody would've smelled something by now.
#unknown There's got to be something.
#unknown Some detail that we haven't picked up on.
#unknown What about the second cell phone? Jesus.
#unknown What? We can't just ignore a potential clue, Hank.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown What are you talking about? The call you said Walt got before he disappeared? There's no record of it with the phone company.
#unknown No incoming, no dropped calls, nothing.
#unknown But his phone rang.
#unknown I heard it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Well, then if that's the case, he must have a second phone.
#unknown Why? What sense would there be in that? Yeah.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'm not here to argue with you.
#unknown No, Hank.
#unknown You can't just bring up secret cell phone and then drop it.
#unknown What does it mean? I don't know, Sky.
#unknown What do you want me to say? It means Walt has a secret.
#unknown Everyone's got one from somebody, big or little.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Everyone.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Skyler, come on.
#unknown He kept cancer from you for weeks.
#unknown Okay, then, let's assume there's a second cell phone.
#unknown So what? What, is he having an affair? Walt? Please.
#unknown What about the marijuana? He's not on pot anymore.
#unknown Says who? Him? Chemotherapy and marijuana go together like apple pie and Chevrolet.
#unknown Maybe he's addicted to the pot and he owes his drug dealer a lot of money.
#unknown Marie, you don't get hooked on pot like that.
#unknown How do you know? You didn't even know he had a second cell phone.
#unknown Hank, you have to question this drugdealer person.
#unknown He may know something.
#unknown Well, I'm telling you, we're grasping at straws here.
#unknown Then grasp.
#unknown Excuse me, ma'am.
#unknown Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
#unknown He around? No.
#unknown I'm afraid not.
#unknown Why? I'm sorry.
#unknown Hank Schrader.
#unknown I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse about my brotherinlaw, Walter White.
#unknown He taught your son chemistry in high school.
#unknown Oh, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Yes, I remember him.
#unknown That was a long time ago.
#unknown Yes, ma'am.
#unknown It's my understanding that he and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.
#unknown Really? Yeah.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White must've seen some potential in Jesse.
#unknown He really tried to motivate him.
#unknown He was one of the few teachers who cared.
#unknown Yeah, Walt's that way.
#unknown He's a good man.
#unknown I'm so sorry to hear about his illness.
#unknown Please pass along our best wishes.
#unknown I certainly will, as soon as he turns up.
#unknown He's missing, actually.
#unknown Just kind of walked off, or.
#unknown Anyway, which is why I'm going around trying to think of anyone who knows him, even slightly.
#unknown That's terrible.
#unknown Anything we can do to help.
#unknown Well, if you could put me in touch with your son.
#unknown Like I said, we're kind of desperate for leads.
#unknown Jesse's not answering either number, and no one seems to be at his house.
#unknown And why do you think my son and Mr.
#unknown White would be in touch? I don't necessarily.
#unknown I just Are you with the police? No, ma'am.
#unknown Not at all.
#unknown I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Is my son in trouble? I have absolutely no reason to think that, no.
#unknown Do I need to get a lawyer? You know, you don't seem very forthright about this coming here and asking questions about my son and Mrs.
#unknown Pinkman, I'm not here on official capacity.
#unknown I do not care what your son may or may not have done wrong.
#unknown I just wanna find my brotherinlaw.
#unknown His wife is worried sick, and she's got a baby on the way.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I would like to help you but I have not seen my son in over a month.
#unknown I don't expect to see him anytime soon.
#unknown Well, thanks for your time.
#unknown If you could tell me one more thing.
#unknown Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy Monte Carlo, as far as you know? If he had spent half as much time and money on his education as he has on that ridiculous bouncing car.
#unknown Low rider, huh? Gomey, hey.
#unknown No, nothing yet.
#unknown Hey, listen, do me a solid and check out a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Specifically, I wanna know if the car's got a LoJack.
#unknown It's one of those jackoff low riders, so I'm betting there is.
#unknown If so, can you go ahead and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.
#unknown Chilli powder.
#unknown Did I not already tell you how moronic that was? Whatever, man.
#unknown At least I tried something.
#unknown Hey, it almost worked too.
#unknown How's about you leaving my gun, huh? First you boost it, then you leave it in your house.
#unknown My gun.
#unknown How was I supposed to know you were chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep? Well, at least he wants you alive.
#unknown Hey, I don't get it.
#unknown If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo, then who did? I don't know.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Does it really matter? If he finds out that Gonzo is dead and not a police informant who does he automatically blame? Us.
#unknown We need a plan.
#unknown Think, think.
#unknown Let's just bumrush him, man.
#unknown You crack him over the head with something and I'll go for his gun.
#unknown Crack him over the head with something? Hey, you got the Cbomb, man, all right? You're as good as checked out already.
#unknown Okay? You should be, like, all sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.
#unknown Just.
#unknown Oh, so my life is not the priority here because I'm gonna be dead soon anyway.
#unknown That's your point? Yeah.
#unknown We gotta get him to take this.
#unknown Well, he don't much like the taste of chilli P.
#unknown That much has been established.
#unknown So unless you can convince him to booty bump.
#unknown Eat.
#unknown We got a long ride ahead of us.
#unknown Go on, sit.
#unknown You're looking a little weak, Heisenberg.
#unknown I don't want you to go belly up before we get there.
#unknown Take it easy, Tio.
#unknown I will feed you.
#unknown I eat first.
#unknown That's the deal.
#unknown What? I get it, I get it, I get it.
#unknown Oh, you greedy old bastard.
#unknown I tell you, Heisenberg.
#unknown Old people.
#unknown You feed them, huh? You put them in a really nice crib in the country and yet they gotta steal the food off your plate.
#unknown You better eat every bite of that.
#unknown What did you do that for? God! Hey, look.
#unknown Look.
#unknown There's nothing left.
#unknown What? What do you want? No.
#unknown Don't even tell me that you're hungry.
#unknown Don't go there.
#unknown Are you maddogging them, Tio? What, you don't like them? One ding.
#unknown That means yes.
#unknown Tio don't like you.
#unknown Why don't you like them, Tio? You don't trust them? Why don't you trust them, Tio? Tuco, come on.
#unknown He's.
#unknown There clearly some dementia.
#unknown He's not lucid.
#unknown Did they do something to you, Tio? Something that you don't like? What did they do to you? What did you do to my tio? Nothing.
#unknown Nothing.
#unknown Bullshit! My tio does not lie! I don't know.
#unknown I swear.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown No, l Maybe it was I did change the channel on his TV, but.
#unknown Yeah, that's it.
#unknown While you were cooking he was watching one of those telenovels with all those ripe honeys on it.
#unknown He was really into it.
#unknown I told you not to change the channel.
#unknown You know, dude needs his eye candy.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown Is that it, Tio? Is that it, Tio? Did they change your mamitas? What are you telling me, Tio? Are they punking me? Hey.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, man.
#unknown No.
#unknown Come here! No.
#unknown No, no, Tuco.
#unknown Tuco, no.
#unknown Tuco.
#unknown Shut up! No.
#unknown Please, no.
#unknown God.
#unknown Please, no.
#unknown No, God.
#unknown I don't wanna die.
#unknown Tell me what you did, Walter! Jesus, I don't wanna die.
#unknown No! Tell me what you did! We tried to poison you.
#unknown We tried to poison you because you're an insane, degenerate piece of filth and you deserve to die.
#unknown Who's the bitch now? Let him bleed.
#unknown The keys.
#unknown Tuco.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown The cousins? What the hell is going on? Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown You're a hard man to find.
#unknown Oh, shit.
#unknown Easy.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown Who? Hank.
#unknown What? Oh, my God.
#unknown What? Oh, my God.
#unknown Stay.
#unknown What are you doing?
