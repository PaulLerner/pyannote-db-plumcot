#unknown Let's get something straight.
#unknown This, the chemistry, is my realm.
#unknown I am in charge of the cooking.
#unknown Out there on the street, you deal with that.
#unknown As far as our customers go, I don't wanna know anything about them.
#unknown I don't want to see them.
#unknown I don't want to hear from them.
#unknown I want no interaction with them whatsoever.
#unknown This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner.
#unknown You got any issues with that? Whatever, man.
#unknown No matter what happens, no more bloodshed.
#unknown No violence.
#unknown "Crazy Handful of Nothin'" Walt?  You all right?  Oh, yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm okay.
#unknown You know, honey, you really don't have to Look, I like being here with you.
#unknown I'm only saying that, I'd be okay with it, really, if you want to go.
#unknown You know, actually, it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there when Walter Jr.
#unknown gets home from school.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You'll call me when you're finished?  Oh, yeah.
#unknown And have you been in touch with Elliott? Because I haven't seen a check from him.
#unknown Yes, I got it.
#unknown Really?  It came, yeah.
#unknown Yeah, it came last week, and I put it right into my credit union account, so Taken care of it.
#unknown Good.
#unknown So we're good.
#unknown We're good.
#unknown Could you not deposit this until Monday? Thank you.
#unknown Call if the discomfort's too much.
#unknown Otherwise, we'll see you next week.
#unknown matter and energy.
#unknown When a reaction is gradual, the change in energy is slight.
#unknown I mean, you don't even notice the reaction is happening.
#unknown For example, when rust collects on the underside of a car.
#unknown But if a reaction happens quickly, otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy.
#unknown Who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction? Hint, hint.
#unknown Right here.
#unknown Like an explosion? Yes.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Explosions.
#unknown Explosions are the result of chemical reactions happening almost instantaneously.
#unknown And the faster reactants, i.
#unknown e.
#unknown , explosives, and fulminative mercury is a prime example of that, the faster they undergo change, the more violent the explosion.
#unknown So explosions.
#unknown Okay, listen.
#unknown Why don't you start reading on your own from the top of chapter 7, all right? You okay? I got it, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Don't worry.
#unknown You got kids to teach.
#unknown Thanks, Hugo.
#unknown He's starting to lose weight, which is tough to see that.
#unknown You know, to feel the difference when I put my arms around him.
#unknown Can I talk to him?  Of course.
#unknown Walt when you don't let me in, when you don't tell me what's going on, I think it's like I feel like you don't even want me around sometimes.
#unknown No.
#unknown And recently these afternoons, when you're coming home so late and we're just left wondering where you are.
#unknown Yeah, Dad.
#unknown What's up with that? Walt, is there anything else you're holding back from your family? Now's the time to share.
#unknown Well I like to be alone, I mean at times, and it's not about you, really.
#unknown It's just that sometimes it feels better not to talk at all about anything, to anyone.
#unknown Alone time can be helpful for some types.
#unknown Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone might make it easier for your family to be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.
#unknown Well I like to go on walks a couple of times a week, maybe more, after work, And I really enjoy the nature.
#unknown You know, the cacti, the vegetation, that kind of thing.
#unknown It's really very therapeutic.
#unknown Yo! You okay?  Did you breathe that shit?  No.
#unknown I'm just dizzy.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Sit down, sit down.
#unknown I'm burning up.
#unknown Take this off.
#unknown Sit down.
#unknown Get some air.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown Yeah, that's better.
#unknown When were you going to tell me? Tell you what? Cancer.
#unknown You got it, right? How did you know? My aunt had one of those dots on her, to target the radiation.
#unknown What is it, in your lung? I'm your partner, man.
#unknown You should have told me.
#unknown That's not cool, okay? Not at all.
#unknown What stage are you? Gone to your lymph nodes.
#unknown Your aunt.
#unknown How bad was she when they caught it? Bad enough.
#unknown She didn't last long.
#unknown How long? Seven months.
#unknown I get it now.
#unknown That's why you're doing all this.
#unknown You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.
#unknown You got a problem with that?  You tell me.
#unknown You're the one that looks like you just crawled out of a microwave.
#unknown You going to be able to finish the batch? Yes.
#unknown All right.
#unknown No.
#unknown You do it.
#unknown Me? Yeah.
#unknown What happened to your mad skills? Go on.
#unknown Here.
#unknown You do it.
#unknown You can do it.
#unknown If you have any questions, I'll be right out here.
#unknown The next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo.
#unknown My aunt said it helped with the hair loss.
#unknown What's this? Christmas? This the one we found way out in the boonies, the cook site?  Holy shit.
#unknown What? Lab pulled up an imprint of some old writing that used to be on the inside.
#unknown Old Magic Marker or something.
#unknown Yeah? What's it say? "Property of J.
#unknown P.
#unknown Wynne Chemistry Lab.
#unknown " That's Walt's school.
#unknown We were supposed to start at 3.
#unknown I'm out there making fat stacks, man.
#unknown Chill.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Prepaid cell phone.
#unknown Use it.
#unknown How much is this?  26 big ones.
#unknown Is that all? $26,000? No, that's 26 hundred, and your share is 13, minus 25 bucks for that phone.
#unknown How much meth did you sell?  Nearly an ounce.
#unknown Last time I checked, there were 16 ounces to a pound.
#unknown You smoked the rest? I've been out there all night slinging crystal.
#unknown You think it's cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time? Why are you selling it in such small quanties? Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once? To who? What do I look like, Scarface? This is unacceptable.
#unknown I am breaking the law here.
#unknown This return is too little for the risk.
#unknown I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.
#unknown You may know a lot about chemistry, but you don't know jack about slinging dope.
#unknown Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it.
#unknown You've got to be more imaginative, you know? Just think outside the box here.
#unknown We have to move our product in bulk, wholesale, now.
#unknown How do we do that?  What do you mean, to a distributor?  Yes.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown That's what we need.
#unknown We need a distributor now.
#unknown Do you know anyone like that? Yeah, I mean I used to until you killed him.
#unknown So who took Krazy8's place? Some guy named Tuco.
#unknown A bad ass, from what I hear.
#unknown Tuco, okay.
#unknown So then just go talk to Tuco.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Like, "Hello, sir.
#unknown Hey, I know you don't know me, "but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?" Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps? You just don't get it, man.
#unknown This guy's O.
#unknown G.
#unknown What does that mean? Jesus, look, he's upper level, man.
#unknown He's not going to do business with some dude he doesn't know.
#unknown You don't understand the way it works.
#unknown You can't just bum rush some highlevel ice man and start cutting deals, okay? It's risky.
#unknown You need an intro.
#unknown You need someone to vouch.
#unknown Well, who introduced you to Krazy8? Emilio.
#unknown That's only because I knew him from, like, third grade.
#unknown We can't talk to Emilio, either  All right, all right.
#unknown Look, I'm telling you, Mr.
#unknown White, it's too risky.
#unknown Okay? I mean, we're making money.
#unknown Why can't you just be satisfied with the way it is? Jesus! Just grow some fucking balls! Wait till Monday again? Yes, please.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Thank you, Hugo.
#unknown Knockknock.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown How are you feeling, Walt?  Good.
#unknown Are you up for having a visitor? Hey, buddy.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown Let me know if you need anything.
#unknown I will.
#unknown Thank you, Carmen.
#unknown No problem.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown That chick's got an ass like an onion.
#unknown Makes me want to cry.
#unknown So what are you doing here? Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you, workrelated.
#unknown You okay? I could come back later.
#unknown No, no, no, no.
#unknown I'm fine.
#unknown Everything's fine.
#unknown What do you mean workrelated, though? Do you recognize that? No.
#unknown That was used to cook meth.
#unknown Found that on some Indian land about 40 miles from here.
#unknown Old label on the inside used to say J.
#unknown P.
#unknown Wynne Chemistry Lab.
#unknown Really? I don't understand how that came from here.
#unknown I was hoping you could help me.
#unknown We found it near an abandoned car belonging to one of our snitches.
#unknown A snitch? Yeah, one of our confidential informants.
#unknown Went missing a while back.
#unknown No body yet, but we're pretty sure he's, you know Probably chopped up in little pieces and fed to the buzzards.
#unknown Anyway, any respirators like that go missing lately? No.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, I mean, not that I know of.
#unknown I'll need to take a look at that inventory.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown I got a list hanging on the wall.
#unknown You mind if I take a look at your storeroom? Not at all, no.
#unknown Be my guest.
#unknown Right.
#unknown So who's got keys? Well, the science faculty, the staff, Carmen, the vice principal has the master, and me.
#unknown How about students? No, no.
#unknown No students have keys.
#unknown I should hope not.
#unknown My question is do any know where you keep them? I don't think so.
#unknown No.
#unknown Besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so Walt, look, I know they're your students, but, do not underestimate them.
#unknown Big mistake.
#unknown Are there any other respirators? Uh, no.
#unknown Because I'm counting six.
#unknown Inventory says eight.
#unknown Glassware looking a little sparse.
#unknown Is it?  Yeah.
#unknown You're missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks at least.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown A 5,000 milliliter round bottom.
#unknown Meth heads love to brew in this, baby.
#unknown Going to answer that? No, it's just No, I don't Maybe it's Skyler.
#unknown She's in trouble or something.
#unknown Don't ignore it on my account.
#unknown Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do.
#unknown Jeez.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown What's up, Mr.
#unknown W? Speaking.
#unknown Bad time to talk?  Absolutely.
#unknown All right, so just listen.
#unknown You know that guy we were talking about, Tuco? Turns out my boy Skinny Pete was in the same cellblock with him over at Los Lunas.
#unknown So we got our in.
#unknown We're hauling a pound to the dude right now.
#unknown Okay, then.
#unknown Thank you very much for calling.
#unknown My doctor is very solicitous.
#unknown Look, buddy, the last thing I want to do is get you in hot water, but some meth monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay? You got to keep a better watch over your turf.
#unknown I will.
#unknown We don't want people to start wondering about you, right? Right.
#unknown No.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Absolutely not.
#unknown So you're sure you're tight with this guy? Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.
#unknown Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete! Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Atta man.
#unknown That's what's happening.
#unknown Yo, Tuco's expecting us.
#unknown No need, man.
#unknown Me and Tuco go back.
#unknown Tuco.
#unknown What's happening, my brother? Sick crib, yo.
#unknown You been keeping it real since you been sprung.
#unknown What's it been, like a year?  This your boy?  Yeah, Jesse.
#unknown The dude with the glass I was telling you about.
#unknown Hey, man.
#unknown Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.
#unknown Break out the ice.
#unknown Take a bump.
#unknown No worries, man.
#unknown I'm no cop.
#unknown I said hit it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape.
#unknown Where'd you get it?  I cooked it.
#unknown Bullshit! Who you working for? No one, man.
#unknown I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but that's it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown We got a deal.
#unknown See? I told you Tuco would hook you up.
#unknown Cool.
#unknown I haven't said how much.
#unknown All right.
#unknown How much? Well, you're a little light, ese.
#unknown It's all right.
#unknown Don't sweat it.
#unknown It's all good.
#unknown It's good.
#unknown Walk.
#unknown Get out of here.
#unknown What about the money?  You'll get it.
#unknown This is a consignment operation.
#unknown You want me to float 35 G's? You don't trust me? No, no.
#unknown Hey, it's not that, man.
#unknown It's just, you know, I don't I don't do business that way.
#unknown Tough shit! The deal is done! You said this was cool.
#unknown Get money for meth.
#unknown Cash up front.
#unknown Don't front, dude.
#unknown Tuco's good for it.
#unknown I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me! Come on! Oh, come on! All right, you brought me some really clean crystal.
#unknown Do you really want your money up front? Up front.
#unknown Nobody moves crystal in the South Valley but me, bitch! Good morning, Hugo.
#unknown Don't mind if I call you Hugo Hugo.
#unknown We've never had a crowd on the street like that.
#unknown Is that Uncle Hank? Uncle Hank's arresting Mr.
#unknown Archuleta.
#unknown This doesn't make any sense to me at all.
#unknown I don't understand.
#unknown I got two words for you: background check.
#unknown How about that? Yo, yo, yo.
#unknown 1483369, representing the ABQ.
#unknown What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.
#unknown Where the hell are you? Call me back.
#unknown Hey, Walt.
#unknown Yeah? Hank's about to deal.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'll be right there.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let's see what the turn brings us.
#unknown You're looking good, Walt.
#unknown Your color's better.
#unknown Yeah? Thanks.
#unknown He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now.
#unknown Dr.
#unknown Delcavoli's trying to talk him into taking some time off from work, but Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning, and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks.
#unknown I just didn't have a chance to tell you.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Your bet, tough guy.
#unknown Check.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Check.
#unknown Check's in the mail.
#unknown Red's 25 million.
#unknown Blue's 10.
#unknown Then 25 million because that's how I roll.
#unknown Hey, Uncle Hank, why were you arresting Mr.
#unknown Archuleta the other day? He's a pretty cool guy.
#unknown Well, turns out that he has a record.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Couple of possession beefs.
#unknown We figure he was the guy that was stealing your school's chemistry gear.
#unknown I mean, you know, he had a key.
#unknown Fit the profile.
#unknown When we searched his truck, we found a big old fat blunt, which goes to prove old Huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.
#unknown It's to you, Walt.
#unknown Yeah, I'll call.
#unknown I can't believe the school system didn't know about this guy's record.
#unknown I mean, that's pretty scary.
#unknown How could something like that just slip through the cracks? I don't know.
#unknown I mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just doesn't strike me as the thief.
#unknown Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but you wouldn't know a criminal if he was close enough to check you for a hernia.
#unknown Now, that said, we got a search warrant, and we tore old Hugo's house apart.
#unknown Turns out he's a major league pothead.
#unknown But he didn't raid your chemistry set.
#unknown You hiding something? I'm in.
#unknown And the river card.
#unknown Yeah, I got nothing.
#unknown I'm out.
#unknown I'm out.
#unknown Yowsa! When old "holes in her purse" bails, you know you're in deep.
#unknown Looks like it's you and me, buddy.
#unknown What's going to happen to him? Hugo.
#unknown Well, I mean, he's going to lose his job, like he should.
#unknown Probably spend a couple months in County, as it's not his first rap.
#unknown I'm waiting.
#unknown You going to man up, or you're going to puss out? Hank.
#unknown What? Sorry.
#unknown I'm all in.
#unknown No.
#unknown You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.
#unknown What are you smoking there, huh? You got a heart? You got the flush, don't you? Nope.
#unknown Not falling for it, buddy.
#unknown I fold.
#unknown Talk about anticlimactic.
#unknown Your cards couldn't have been that bad.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown You threw away an ace  What are you doing? Don't.
#unknown and a cowboy, for A handful of nothing.
#unknown Who is this? I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Well, where is he, then? You the guy? Yeah, I'm the guy.
#unknown How is he? Got some busted ribs and like that.
#unknown Got messed up pretty good.
#unknown I was all like "Damn, Tuco, chill, ese.
#unknown " I don't know what got into him.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown Oh, he's out, man, way out.
#unknown They got him doped up bigtime.
#unknown So you're the cook, huh? Yo, I didn't catch your name.
#unknown Tell me about this Tuco.
#unknown Tell me everything about him.
#unknown Good morning.
#unknown Would you pass the butter, please? Bad ass, Dad.
#unknown You Tuco? I want to talk to Tuco, and I'm not leaving until I do.
#unknown What's your name? Heisenberg.
#unknown Heisenberg.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Have a seat, Heisenberg.
#unknown I don't imagine I'll be here very long.
#unknown No? All right.
#unknown Be that way.
#unknown It's your meeting.
#unknown Why don't you start talking and tell me what you want? $50,000.
#unknown Oh, man! 50 G's? How you figure that? of meth you stole and another 15 for my partner's pain and suffering.
#unknown Partner.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown I remember that little bitch.
#unknown So you must be Daddy.
#unknown Let me get this straight.
#unknown I steal your dope, hmm? I beat the piss out of your mule boy! And then you walk in here, and you bring me more meth? That's a brilliant plan, ese.
#unknown Brilliant.
#unknown You got one part of that wrong.
#unknown This is not meth.
#unknown Are you nuts? You want to find out? NoDoze, Gonzo, calma! Calma.
#unknown Calma.
#unknown You got balls.
#unknown I'll give you that.
#unknown All right.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I'll give you your money.
#unknown That crystal that your partner brought me, it sold faster than $10 ass in TJ.
#unknown What say you bring me another pound next week? Money up front.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Money up front.
#unknown Sometimes you got to rob to keep your riches.
#unknown Just as long as we got an understanding.
#unknown One pound is not going to cut it.
#unknown You have to take two.
#unknown Orale.
#unknown What is that shit? Fulminated mercury.
#unknown A little tweak of chemistry.
#unknown
