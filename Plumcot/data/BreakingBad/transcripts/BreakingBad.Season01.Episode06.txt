walter_white  Let's get something straight.
walter_white  This, the chemistry, is my realm.
walter_white  I am in charge of the cooking.
walter_white  Out there on the street, you deal with that.
walter_white  As far as our customers go, I don't wanna know anything about them.
walter_white  I don't want to see them. I don't want to hear from them
walter_white  I want no interaction with them whatsoever.
walter_white  This operation is you and me, and I'm the silent partner.
walter_white  You got any issues with that?
jesse_pinkman  Whatever, man.
walter_white  No matter what happens, no more bloodshed.
walter_white  Nothin'" Walt? You all
skyler_white  right? Oh
walter_white  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
walter_white  I'm okay.
walter_white  You know, honey, you really don't have to
skyler_white  I like being here with you.
walter_white  I'm
walter_white  I'm only saying that, I'd be okay with it, really, if you want to go.
walter_white  You know, actually, it would make me feel a little better knowing that you were there when Walter Jr. gets home from school.
skyler_white  Okay
skyler_white  Okay. All right. You'll call me when you're finished?
skyler_white  And have you been in touch with Elliott? Because
skyler_white  Because I haven't seen a check from him.
walter_white  Yes, I got it.
skyler_white  Really?
walter_white  It came, yeah.
walter_white  Yeah
walter_white  it came last week, and I put it right into my credit union account,
walter_white  so Taken care of it
skyler_white  Good.
walter_white  So we're good.
walter_white  We're good.
walter_white  Could you not deposit this until Monday?
clinic's_clerk  Call if the discomfort's too much. Otherwise, we'll see you next week.
walter_white  matter and energy.
walter_white  When a reaction is gradual, the change in energy is slight. I
walter_white  I mean, you don't even notice the reaction is happening.
walter_white  For example, when rust collects on the underside of a car.
walter_white  But if a reaction happens quickly, otherwise harmless substances can interact in a way that generates enormous bursts of energy.
walter_white  Who can give me an example of rapid chemical reaction?
walter_white  hint.
walter_white  Right here
student_#1  Like an explosion?
walter_white  Yes. Good.
walter_white  Explosions.
walter_white  Explosions are the result of chemical reactions happening almost instantaneously.
walter_white  And the faster reactants, i. e., explosives,
walter_white  and fulminative mercury is a prime example of that,
walter_white  faster they undergo change, the more violent the explosion.
walter_white  explosions.
walter_white  Okay, listen. Why don't you start reading on your own from the top of chapter 7,
hugo_archuleta  okay?
hugo_archuleta  I got it, Mr. White. Don't worry.
hugo_archuleta  kids to teach.
walter_white  Thanks, Hugo.
skyler_white  He's starting to lose weight, which is tough to see that.
skyler_white  You know, to feel the difference when I put my arms around him.
mrs._pope  Of course
skyler_white  Walt when you don't let me in, when you don't tell me what's going on, I think it's like I feel like you don't even want me around sometimes.
skyler_white  And recently these afternoons, when you're coming home so late and we're just left wondering where you are.
walter_white_jr.  Yeah, Dad.
walter_white_jr.  What's up with that?
mrs._pope  Walt, is there anything else you're holding back from your family?
mrs._pope  Now's the time to share.
walter_white  Well I like to be alone, I mean at times,
walter_white  and it's not about you, really.
walter_white  It's just that sometimes it feels better not to talk at all about anything, to anyone.
mrs._pope  Alone time can be helpful for some types.
mrs._pope  Maybe knowing what you do when you're alone might make it easier for your family to be more accepting of whatever it is you do alone.
walter_white  Well I like to go on walks a couple of times a week, maybe more, after work
walter_white  And I really enjoy the nature.
walter_white  You know, the cacti, the vegetation, that kind of thing.
walter_white  It's really very therapeutic.
jesse_pinkman  Yo! You okay?
walter_white  Did you breathe that shit?
walter_white  No.
walter_white  just dizzy.
walter_white  Come here.
jesse_pinkman  Sit
walter_white  Sit down, sit down
jesse_pinkman  off. Sit down. Get some air.
jesse_pinkman  that's better. When were you going to tell me?
walter_white  Tell you what?
jesse_pinkman  Cancer.
jesse_pinkman  You got it, right?
walter_white  How did you know?
jesse_pinkman  My aunt had one of those dots on her, to target the radiation.
jesse_pinkman  What is it, in your lung?
jesse_pinkman  I'm your partner, man. You should have told me.
jesse_pinkman  That's not cool, okay?
jesse_pinkman  Not at all.
jesse_pinkman  What stage are you?
jesse_pinkman  to your lymph nodes.
walter_white  Your aunt. How bad was she when they caught it
jesse_pinkman  Bad enough. She didn't last long.
walter_white  How long?
jesse_pinkman  Seven months.
jesse_pinkman  I get it now.
jesse_pinkman  That's why you're doing all this.
jesse_pinkman  You want to make some cash for your people before you check out.
walter_white  You got a problem with that?
jesse_pinkman  You tell me.
jesse_pinkman  You're the one that looks like you just crawled out of a microwave.
jesse_pinkman  You going to be able to finish the batch?
walter_white  Yes.
walter_white  You do it.
jesse_pinkman  Me?
walter_white  Yeah.
walter_white  What happened to your mad skills?
walter_white  Go on.
walter_white  Here
walter_white  You do it.
walter_white  You can do it.
walter_white  If you have any questions, I'll be right out here.
jesse_pinkman  next time, put an ice pack on your head during chemo.
jesse_pinkman  My aunt said it helped with the hair loss.
hank_schrader  This
hank_schrader  the one we found way out in the boonies, the cook
hank_schrader  site? Holy shit.
steven_gomez  What
hank_schrader  What? Lab pulled up an imprint of some old writing that used to be on the inside. Old Magic Marker or something.
steven_gomez  Yeah? What's
steven_gomez  What's it say?
hank_schrader  Property of J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.
hank_schrader  That's Walt's school.
walter_white  We were supposed to start at 3.
jesse_pinkman  I'm out there making fat stacks, man. Chill
jesse_pinkman  Chill. Hey.
jesse_pinkman  Prepaid cell phone.
jesse_pinkman  Use it.
walter_white  How much is this?
jesse_pinkman  26 big ones.
walter_white  that all?
Walter_White  No
jesse_pinkman  No, that's 26 hundred, and your share is 13, minus 25 bucks for that phone.
walter_white  How much meth did you sell?
jesse_pinkman  Nearly an ounce.
walter_white  Last time I checked, there were 16 ounces to a pound.
walter_white  You smoked the rest? I've
jesse_pinkman  I've been out there all night slinging crystal.
jesse_pinkman  You think it's cake moving a pound of meth one teenth at a time?
walter_white  Why are you selling it in such small quanties?
walter_white  Why don't you just sell the whole pound at once?
jesse_pinkman  To who?
jesse_pinkman  What do I look like, Scarface?
walter_white  This is unacceptable.
walter_white  I am breaking the law here.
walter_white  This return is too little for the risk.
walter_white  I thought you'd be ready for another pound today.
jesse_pinkman  You may know a lot about chemistry, but you don't know jack about slinging dope.
walter_white  Well, I'll tell you, I know a lack of motivation when I see it.
walter_white  You've got to be more imaginative, you know? Just
walter_white  Just think outside the box here.
walter_white  We have to move our product in bulk, wholesale,
walter_white  now. How do we do that?
jesse_pinkman  you mean, to a distributor?
walter_white  Yes.
walter_white  Yes. That's what we need.
walter_white  We need a distributor now
walter_white  now. Do you know anyone like that?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, I mean I used to until you killed him.
walter_white  So who took Krazy8's place?
jesse_pinkman  Some guy named Tuco.
jesse_pinkman  ass, from what I hear.
walter_white  Tuco, okay.
walter_white  So then just go talk to Tuco.
jesse_pinkman  Right.
jesse_pinkman  Like," Hello, sir. Hey
jesse_pinkman  Hey, I know you don't know me," but would you be interested in a felony quantity of methamphetamine?" Well
walter_white  Well, yes, but maybe with a little more salesmanship, perhaps?
jesse_pinkman  You just don't get it, man.
jesse_pinkman  This guy's O. G.
walter_white  What does that mean?
jesse_pinkman  Jesus, look, he's upper level, man.
jesse_pinkman  He's not going to do business with some dude he doesn't know.
jesse_pinkman  You don't understand the way it works.
jesse_pinkman  You can't just bum rush some highlevel ice man and start cutting deals,
jesse_pinkman  It's
jesse_pinkman  It's risky. You
jesse_pinkman  You need an intro. You need someone to vouch.
walter_white  Well, who introduced you to Krazy8? Emilio
jesse_pinkman  Emilio. That's only because I knew him from, like, third grade.
jesse_pinkman  We can't talk to Emilio, either
walter_white  either All right, all right.
jesse_pinkman  Look, I'm telling you, Mr. White, it's too risky.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, we're making money.
jesse_pinkman  Why can't you just be satisfied with the way it is
walter_white  is?
walter_white  Jesus!
walter_white  Just grow some fucking balls!
clinic's_clerk  Wait till Monday again?
walter_white  Yes, please.
hugo_archuleta  Thank you. Mr. White.
walter_white  Thank you, Hugo.
carmen_molina  Knockknock. Oh
walter_white  Oh, hey.
carmen_molina  How are you feeling, Walt?
walter_white  Good
carmen_molina  Are you up for having a visitor?
hank_schrader  buddy.
walter_white  Hank.
carmen_molina  Let me know if you need anything.
walter_white  I will.
walter_white  Thank you, Carmen.
hank_schrader  Damn.
hank_schrader  chick's got an ass like an onion.
walter_white  Makes me want to cry. So what are you doing here?
hank_schrader  Well, I had some questions I wanted to run by you, workrelated.
hank_schrader  You okay? I
hank_schrader  I could come back later.
walter_white  No, no, no, no. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
walter_white  What
Walter_White  What do you mean workrelated, though?
hank_schrader  Do you recognize that?
hank_schrader  That was used to cook meth.
hank_schrader  Found that on some Indian land about 40 miles from here.
hank_schrader  label on the inside used to say
hank_schrader  J. P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.
walter_white  Really?
walter_white  don't understand how that came from here.
hank_schrader  I was hoping you could help me. We
hank_schrader  We found it near an abandoned car belonging to one of our snitches.
walter_white  Yeah
hank_schrader  Yeah, one of our confidential informants.
hank_schrader  Went missing a while back.
hank_schrader  No body yet, but we're pretty sure he's, you know
hank_schrader  Probably chopped up in little pieces and fed to the buzzards.
hank_schrader  Anyway, any respirators like that go missing lately?
walter_white  No. No.
walter_white  No,
walter_white  I mean, not that I know of.
hank_schrader  I'll need to take a look at that inventory.
walter_white  Sure.
walter_white  I got a list hanging on the wall.
hank_schrader  You mind if I take a look at your storeroom?
walter_white  Not at all,
walter_white  no.
walter_white  my guest.
hank_schrader  So who's got keys?
walter_white  the science faculty, the staff, Carmen, the vice principal has the master, and me.
hank_schrader  How about students?
walter_white  No, no.
walter_white  No students have keys.
hank_schrader  I should hope not.
hank_schrader  My question is do any know where you keep them?
walter_white  I don't think so. No.
walter_white  Besides, I keep them right here in my pocket anyway, so
hank_schrader  Walt, look, I know they're your students, but, do not underestimate them.
hank_schrader  Big mistake.
hank_schrader  Are there any other respirators?
walter_white  no. Because
hank_schrader  Because I'm counting six. Inventory says eight.
hank_schrader  Glassware looking a little sparse.
walter_white  it?
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  missing a couple of Erlenmeyer flasks at least.
hank_schrader  Oh, yeah.
hank_schrader  5,000 milliliter round bottom.
hank_schrader  Meth heads love to brew in this, baby.
hank_schrader  to answer
walter_white  just No, I don't
hank_schrader  Maybe it's Skyler. She's in trouble or
hank_schrader  Don't ignore it on my account. Answer
hank_schrader  Answer it! C'mon
hank_schrader  C'mon, I got stuff to do.
hank_schrader  Okay
walter_white  Okay.
walter_white  Hello.
jesse_pinkman  What's up, Mr. W?
walter_white  Speaking.
jesse_pinkman  Bad time to talk?
walter_white  Absolutely. All
jesse_pinkman  right, so just listen.
jesse_pinkman  You know that guy we were talking about, Tuco?
jesse_pinkman  Turns out my boy Skinny Pete was in the same cellblock with him over at Los Lunas.
jesse_pinkman  So we got
jesse_pinkman  our in. We're hauling
walter_white  a pound to the dude right
walter_white  right now. Okay, then. Thank
walter_white  Thank you very much for calling.
walter_white  My doctor is very solicitous.
hank_schrader  Look, buddy,
hank_schrader  the last thing I want to do is get you in hot water,
hank_schrader  but some meth monkey had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?
hank_schrader  You got to keep a better watch over your turf.
walter_white  I will.
hank_schrader  We don't want people to start wondering about you, right?
walter_white  Right.
walter_white  No.
walter_white  Absolutely
walter_white  Absolutely not.
jesse_pinkman  you're sure you're tight with this guy?
skinny_pete  Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.
skinny_pete  Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!
jesse_pinkman  this isn't such a good idea, yo. Come
skinny_pete  on. Atta man. That's what's happening.
no-doze  Yo, Tuco's expecting us.
skinny_pete  No need, man. Me
skinny_pete  Me and Tuco go back.
skinny_pete  What's happening, my brother?
skinny_pete  Sick crib, yo.
skinny_pete  You been keeping it real since you been sprung. What's
skinny_pete  What's it been, like a year?
tuco_salamanca  This your boy?
skinny_pete  Yeah, Jesse. The
skinny_pete  dude with the glass I was telling you about.
jesse_pinkman  man. Yeah,
jesse_pinkman  I've heard a lot about you.
tuco_salamanca  Break out the ice.
jesse_pinkman  worries, man. I'm no cop.
tuco_salamanca  I said hit it.
tuco_salamanca  This kicks like a mule with his balls wrapped in duct tape.
tuco_salamanca  Where'd you get it?
jesse_pinkman  I cooked it.
tuco_salamanca  Bullshit!
tuco_salamanca  working for?
jesse_pinkman  No one, man. I
jesse_pinkman  I mean, I have a partner that I cook with, but that's it.
tuco_salamanca  All right.
tuco_salamanca  We got a deal.
skinny_pete  I told you Tuco would hook you up.
jesse_pinkman  Cool.
jesse_pinkman  I haven't said how much.
tuco_salamanca  How much?
jesse_pinkman  Well, you're a little light, ese.
tuco_salamanca  It's
tuco_salamanca  It's all right. Don't sweat it. It's
tuco_salamanca  It's all good.
tuco_salamanca  good. Walk
tuco_salamanca  Walk. Get out of
jesse_pinkman  What about the money?
tuco_salamanca  You'll get it.
tuco_salamanca  This is a consignment operation.
jesse_pinkman  You want me to float 35 G's?
tuco_salamanca  don't trust me?
jesse_pinkman  No, no. Hey,
jesse_pinkman  it's not that, man.
jesse_pinkman  It's just, you know, I don't I don't do business that way. Tough
tuco_salamanca  shit! The deal is
jesse_pinkman  done! You said this was cool. Get money
jesse_pinkman  money for meth. Cash up front.
skinny_pete  Don't front, dude. Tuco's good for it
tuco_salamanca  I don't need your punk ass to vouch for me!
jesse_pinkman  Oh, come on!
tuco_salamanca  All right
tuco_salamanca  you brought me some really clean crystal.
tuco_salamanca  you really want your money up front
tuco_salamanca  Up front.
hank_schrader  morning, Hugo.
hank_schrader  Don't mind if I call you Hugo Hugo.
carmen_molina  We've never had a crowd on the
walter_white_jr.  street like that.
hank_schrader  Is
walter_white_jr.  Uncle Hank's arresting Mr. Archuleta.
carmen_molina  This doesn't make any sense to me at all. I
carmen_molina  I don't understand.
hank_schrader  I got two words for you : background check.
hank_schrader  How about that?
jesse_pinkman  Yo, yo, yo. 1483369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.
jesse_pinkman  Where
walter_white  Where the hell are you?
walter_white  Call me back.
skyler_white  Hey, Walt.
walter_white  Yeah?
skyler_white  Hank's about to deal.
walter_white  Okay. I'll be right there.
hank_schrader  All right. Let's see what the turn brings us.
marie_schrader  You're looking good, Walt.
marie_schrader  Your color's better.
walter_white  Yeah
walter_white  Thanks.
skyler_white  He's actually on the pretty strong stuff now.
skyler_white  Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into taking some time off from work, but Well
walter_white  Well, actually, I just talked to Carmen this morning, and they're getting a substitute for a few weeks.
marie_schrader  I
walter_white  I just didn't have a chance to tell you.
walter_white  Sorry.
hank_schrader  Your bet, tough guy.
walter_white_jr.  Check.
skyler_white  Check.
marie_schrader  Check's in the mail.
hank_schrader  Red's 25 million. Blue's 10.
marie_schrader  Then 25 million because that's how I roll.
walter_white_jr.  Hey, Uncle Hank, why were you arresting Mr. Archuleta the other day?
walter_white_jr.  He's a pretty cool guy.
hank_schrader  Well, turns out that he has a record.
hank_schrader  Yeah. Couple of possession beefs.
hank_schrader  We figure he was the guy that was stealing your school's chemistry gear.
hank_schrader  I mean, you know, he had a key. Fit the profile.
hank_schrader  When we searched his truck, we found a big old fat blunt,
hank_schrader  which goes to prove old Huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.
hank_schrader  It's to you, Walt.
walter_white  Yeah, I'll call
skyler_white  call. I can't believe the school system didn't know about this guy's record.
skyler_white  I mean, that's pretty scary.
skyler_white  How could something like that just slip through the cracks?
walter_white  I don't know.
walter_white  mean, for what it's worth, Hugo just doesn't strike me as the thief.
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt, but you wouldn't know a criminal if he was close enough to check you for a hernia.
hank_schrader  that said, we got a search warrant, and we tore old Hugo's house apart.
hank_schrader  Turns out he's a major league pothead.
hank_schrader  But he didn't raid your chemistry set.
hank_schrader  You hiding something?
hank_schrader  I'm in.
hank_schrader  And the river card.
walter_white_jr.  Yeah, I got nothing. I'm out.
hank_schrader  When old" holes in her purse" bails, you know you're in deep.
hank_schrader  Looks like it's you and me, buddy.
walter_white  What's going to happen to him
walter_white  Hugo.
hank_schrader  Well, I mean, he's going to lose his job, like he should.
hank_schrader  Probably spend a couple months in County, as it's not his first rap.
hank_schrader  I'm waiting.
hank_schrader  You going to man up, or you're going to puss out?
skyler_white  Hank.
walter_white  all in
hank_schrader  You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.
hank_schrader  you smoking there
hank_schrader  You got a heart?
hank_schrader  You got the flush, don't you?
hank_schrader  Not falling for it, buddy.
hank_schrader  I fold.
marie_schrader  Talk about anticlimactic. Your
hank_schrader  Your cards
marie_schrader  cards couldn't have been that bad.
marie_schrader  Oh, my God. You
marie_schrader  You threw away an ace What
hank_schrader  What are you doing? Don't.
marie_schrader  and a cowboy, for
marie_schrader  handful of nothing.
walter_white  Who is this?
walter_white  I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.
skinny_pete  Well
walter_white  Well, where is he, then?
skinny_pete  You the guy?
walter_white  Yeah,
walter_white  I'm the guy. How is
skinny_pete  Got some busted ribs and like that.
skinny_pete  Got messed up pretty good.
skinny_pete  I was all like" Damn, Tuco, chill, ese.
skinny_pete  I don't know what got into him.
skinny_pete  Seriously.
skinny_pete  he's out, man,
skinny_pete  way out.
skinny_pete  They got him doped up bigtime.
skinny_pete  So you're the cook, huh?
skinny_pete  Yo, I didn't catch your name.
walter_white  Tell me about this Tuco.
walter_white  Tell me everything about him.
walter_white  Good morning.
walter_white  Would you pass the butter, please?
walter_white_jr.  ass, Dad.
walter_white  You Tuco?
walter_white  I want to talk to Tuco, and I'm not leaving until I do.
tuco_salamanca  your name?
walter_white  Heisenberg.
tuco_salamanca  Heisenberg.
tuco_salamanca  Okay.
tuco_salamanca  seat, Heisenberg.
walter_white  I don't imagine I'll be here very long.
tuco_salamanca  No?
tuco_salamanca  Be that
tuco_salamanca  your meeting.
tuco_salamanca  don't you start talking and tell me what you want?
walter_white  $50,000.
tuco_salamanca  man! 50
tuco_salamanca  50 G's?
tuco_salamanca  How you figure that?
walter_white  of meth you stole and another 15 for my partner's pain and suffering.
tuco_salamanca  Oh, yeah. I remember that little bitch.
tuco_salamanca  So you must be Daddy.
tuco_salamanca  Let me get this straight.
tuco_salamanca  I steal your dope, hmm? I beat the piss out of your mule boy! And then you walk in here, and you bring me more meth?
tuco_salamanca  That's a brilliant plan, ese. Brilliant.
walter_white  You got one part of that wrong.
walter_white  This is not meth.
tuco_salamanca  Are you nuts
walter_white  You want to find out?
tuco_salamanca  NoDoze, Gonzo, calma! Calma. Calma.
tuco_salamanca  You got balls. I'll give you that.
tuco_salamanca  right. All right
tuco_salamanca  I'll give you your money.
tuco_salamanca  crystal that your partner brought me, it sold faster than $10 ass in TJ.
tuco_salamanca  What say you bring me another pound next week?
walter_white  Money up front.
tuco_salamanca  All right
tuco_salamanca  up front. Sometimes you got to rob to keep your riches.
tuco_salamanca  Just as long as we got an understanding.
walter_white  One pound is not going to cut it.
walter_white  You have to take two.
tuco_salamanca  Orale.
tuco_salamanca  What is that shit?
walter_white  Fulminated mercury. A little tweak of chemistry.
