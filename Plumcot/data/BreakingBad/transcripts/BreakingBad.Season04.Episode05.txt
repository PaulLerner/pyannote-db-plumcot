walter_white  a notebook. I wonder if you might take a look. I'm supposed to straighten up and fly right or toe the line or some other crap? My drugaddicted partner doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies. How long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk? It's Pinkman. He's become increasingly incautious.

hank_schrader  does this, you know
tim_roberts  Your boy Heisenberg. Thought we had him already.
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  Keep dreaming.
tim_roberts  Yeah, no.
tim_roberts  Getz busted him a few months back.
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, no offense to Detective Doogie Howser there, but all he caught was a dipshit lifer by the name of Jimmy InNOut.
tim_roberts  This one He's your Heisenberg?
hank_schrader  Yeah, I believe he is.
tim_roberts  So what are you thinking?
tim_roberts  Rival drug gang taking out the mastermind?
tim_roberts  Any names I should check out
hank_schrader  I wish I could help you there.
hank_schrader  Only two people I know connected with the blue stuff.
hank_schrader  one is a beaniewearing jizz stain by the name of Brandon Mayhew Street name, uh, Badger.
hank_schrader  Definitely another player.
hank_schrader  The other one is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.
hank_schrader  He and I have a history.
tim_roberts  You see Pinkman as a shooter?
hank_schrader  That would surprise me.
tim_roberts  Well, we got a composite of a person of interest.
tim_roberts  It's a guy the neighbors saw at Boetticher's place right after the shooting.
hank_schrader  Ehsorry.
tim_roberts  No, hang on to it, just in case. Then
tim_roberts  Then we got a couple of prints we're hoping to I. D.
tim_roberts  If I get any kind of hit, I'll keep you in the loop on that.
hank_schrader  You know, uh, Tim, look, I appreciate what you're doing, really Uh, you know, keeping me involved and all, but, uh, you know, finding this guy Heisenberg dead like this I have to say, it, uh kind of feels like closure to me,
tim_roberts  know? Hank, you really are a big help here.
hank_schrader  No, I know.
hank_schrader  I get it, really.
hank_schrader  But I'm done.
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't need to do that.
jesse_pinkman  This is why I'm out here, right?
jesse_pinkman  be, like, your backup? Uhhuh.
jesse_pinkman  So if I'm out here in a guardtype capacity to watch over the money, that means I need, like, a gun, right?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, isn't that, like, completely idiotic for me to be out here without a gun?
jesse_pinkman  mean, you haven't said dick about what I'm supposed to be doing here,
jesse_pinkman  and I'm supposed to do it without a gun?
jesse_pinkman  How does that even make sense?
jesse_pinkman  What?
jesse_pinkman  I can smoke, right?
mike_ehrmantraut  Not a chance.
jesse_pinkman  It's finally hitting me what the The plan is here.
jesse_pinkman  to bore me to death, so mission accomplished because it's totally working.
jesse_pinkman  Great job.
jesse_pinkman  You know, I really do get what's going on with all the dead drops and bags of cash.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, my boys had the exact same system when I was running things.
jesse_pinkman  My crew.
jesse_pinkman  Nowhere near the same cheese you guys are slinging, but same theory
jesse_pinkman  To maintain separation between dealer and supplier, reduce risk, et cetera
jesse_pinkman  Look, don't you think it would be good if there was some back and forth communication here?
jesse_pinkman  You got me riding shotgun to every dark anal recess of this state.
jesse_pinkman  Be nice if you clued me in a little.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, I'm here to do a job, right?
jesse_pinkman  And, I mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy, then you should just tell me what the hell's up.
jesse_pinkman  What?
mike_ehrmantraut  You are not the guy.
mike_ehrmantraut  You're not capable of being the guy.
mike_ehrmantraut  I had a guy, but now I don't. You
mike_ehrmantraut  You are not the guy.
jesse_pinkman  Then what the hell am I doing here?
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't know.
mike_ehrmantraut  It's not my call.
mike_ehrmantraut  I just do what I'm told,
mike_ehrmantraut  and now you're gonna do what you're told, which is to sit here, shut up, and stay in the car till we finish our pickups.
mike_ehrmantraut  You got it?

mike_ehrmantraut  It all went like you thought it would, more or less.
gustavo_fring  I will, of course, reimburse you to the damage to your vehicles. Hmm
gustavo_fring  Questions?
mike_ehrmantraut  More than a few, yeah.
mike_ehrmantraut  But I know better than to ask.
mike_ehrmantraut  Anyway, it was like you wanted.
mike_ehrmantraut  The kid's a hero.
skyler_white  Just the idea of owning a car wash seems daunting, but I had to warn myself
marie_schrader  myself Who is just the most beautiful little girl in the world? I
marie_schrader  it's you.
skyler_white  So coming into a business like this that's up and running, fully operational, puts us way ahead of the game.
skyler_white  we're still going to have some change over time
skyler_white  time I think it's you. Yeah, I do. But
skyler_white  But we do have a staff in place, so, you know, luckily, we'll be able to hold on to most of Bogdan's employees.
skyler_white  might lose a few to the Ultra Wash across town, though.
skyler_white  They're making a grab, I hear. You
hank_schrader  to put the kid to work? I
walter_white_jr.  I got school.
hank_schrader  I'm not talking about you.
hank_schrader  I'm talking about your baby sister.
hank_schrader  I wouldn't let you near my car.
marie_schrader  Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.
marie_schrader  You should put Holly on the sign.
skyler_white  Like a mascot? Like
marie_schrader  Like the Gerber baby.
marie_schrader  I would get my car washed there every day if I saw her face out front.
walter_white_jr.  What about me?
hank_schrader  The goal is to bring customers in, not scare them away
marie_schrader  Walt, there's another bottle in the kitchen.
marie_schrader  Just help yourself. Ah.
walter_white_jr.  maybe we could roll uncle Hank through the car wash.
walter_white_jr.  He could be the first customer.
walter_white_jr.  The wipedown crew would clean you up good.
hank_schrader  I got your wipedown right here, pal. Hank
marie_schrader  Hank, can you just maybe get through one meal without you saying something disgusting
marie_schrader  So what are you going to
marie_schrader  do with Holly all day? You can't take her to work with all those chemicals and migrants hanging around. Marie What? That can't be safe. Fortunately, there is, just five minutes away from the car wash, there is the top child care center in the city. The National Child Care Association gives it really high ratings, so that's quite a relief, and, you know, it's just a walk away if we need it.
skyler_white  I
skyler_white  to tell you, I'm just I'm really,
skyler_white  impressed.
hank_schrader  I
hank_schrader  came together on this
hank_schrader  really happy that it's working out for you
skyler_white  Thanks. It was a little scary, but it, uh, needed to be done
skyler_white  And, uh, we get possession of the keys tomorrow. Oh, that's awesome
marie_schrader  awesome. Yeah
walter_white_jr.  I can't wait to see what kind of car I'll get for my birthday, now with all this money rolling in. I
marie_schrader  you've been spending too much time around your uncle Hank.
marie_schrader  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
marie_schrader  Right, uncle Hank?
hank_schrader  Squeaky and greasy. That's
hank_schrader  That's you, my friend
hank_schrader  uh, Nick the Greek, you going to share that bottle or what
walter_white  Yeah.
walter_white  Sorry.
walter_white_jr.  Who's Nick the Greek?
hank_schrader  Nick the Greek. He was a famous bigtime card player.
marie_schrader  Hank, that's not funny.
hank_schrader  What?
hank_schrader  It's a compliment.
marie_schrader  Well, that's even worse, then.
marie_schrader  You're giving positive reinforcement to behavior that Walt is working very, very hard to change.
marie_schrader  Right, Skyler?
walter_white_jr.  I don't see how it's bad,
walter_white_jr.  Dad, just raking in the beaucoup bucks now. You
skyler_white  You know, I just, uh, think maybe we could change the subject?
hank_schrader  Yeah. Sure
hank_schrader  Sure.
hank_schrader  You
hank_schrader  Absolutely.
walter_white_jr.  Hey, uncle Hank, what about that case you were looking at with that crazy singing guy?
hank_schrader  Ah, I'm off that.
hank_schrader  I I gave my assessment to the APD, and
hank_schrader  I'm done.
skyler_white  The case of the crazy singing guy.
skyler_white  Sounds like an Encyclopedia Brown story, doesn't it
hank_schrader  Crazy is Is Is, uh, is the wrong word.
hank_schrader  This guy Gale Boetticher, he was, uh, he was eccentric.
hank_schrader  I mean, a real character, you know?
hank_schrader  He's, uh, he's dead now
skyler_white  Who was he?
walter_white_jr.  He was a meth cook.
hank_schrader  Uh, he was a meth chef.
hank_schrader  I mean, we're talking five stars Candles
hank_schrader  Candles and white tablecloths.
hank_schrader  Hey, I can't believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth, but he was a genius, plain and simple.
hank_schrader  I mean, uh, boy, if you applied that big brain of his to something good, I don't know, who knows what could have helped humanity or something like that,
hank_schrader  you know? I mean, how many actual geniuses are there in the world, right?
hank_schrader  he'd kind of taken his life in a different direction,
walter_white  who knows? Hank, not to tell you your business, but I'm not sure I agree.
hank_schrader  What do you mean?
walter_white  Well, I mean, you showed me that notebook and from what I saw
walter_white  And this is just my humble opinion From
walter_white  From what I saw on those papers genius
walter_white  I mean, there was no reasoning, no deductions in those pages.
walter_white  To my eye, all this brilliance looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying
walter_white  Probably of someone else's work.
walter_white  Believe me, I've been around enough students to know.
walter_white  Ah, this genius of yours maybe he's still out there.
hank_schrader  Hey, babe.
hank_schrader  Tim stopped by.
hank_schrader  He brought over some file boxes on that case.
hank_schrader  Thought I'd take another peek.
marie_schrader  That's great.
hank_schrader  Sorry about the mess.
marie_schrader  No, no, no.
marie_schrader  Don't be.
marie_schrader  You want me to make some coffee?
hank_schrader  Yeah
hank_schrader  Yeah. Yeah, that would be
marie_schrader  You find something?
hank_schrader  Oh, just this This guy I'm looking at.
hank_schrader  You know, everything he He He buys and eats is organic, fair trade, vegan.
hank_schrader  Since when do vegans eat fried chicken?
