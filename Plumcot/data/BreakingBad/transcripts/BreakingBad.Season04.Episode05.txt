#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad We found a notebook.
#unknown I wonder if you might take a look.
#unknown I'm supposed to straighten up and fly right or toe the line or some other crap? My drugaddicted partner doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies.
#unknown How long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk? It's Pinkman.
#unknown He's become increasingly incautious.
#unknown Something's got to be done.
#unknown You think this Gale person is your Heisenberg? Jesse! Say you understand.
#unknown Do you understand? Tell me you understand, Saul! Every dollar If you don't hear from me in 24 hours No, no.
#unknown Saul.
#unknown Saul, shut up.
#unknown Shut up and listen to me.
#unknown I want you to give her every last dollar.
#unknown I don't care if you have to stuff it in trash bags.
#unknown Just make sure she gets everything.

#unknown Hello again.
#unknown Mike, tell me now exactly what is going on.
#unknown Jesse's with me today, so what you need to do is to go back to your lab and get on with the cook.
#unknown You're gonna have to muddle through this one without him, okay? That's what's going on.
#unknown But it doesn't Goodbye, Walter.
#unknown Mike Sir Excuse me.
#unknown Sir.
#unknown You're not allowed back there.
#unknown Excuse me, sir.
#unknown As I said, sir, Mr.
#unknown Fring is not here.
#unknown This area's for employees only, and I have to ask that you leave immediately.
#unknown What you told Mr.
#unknown White, that's that's just bullshit, right? You, uh, you figure on just leaving me in some ditch? What do you care? I don't.
#unknown But I'll tell you now, you better shoot straight, old man, or I'll slice off your other ear before this is over.
#unknown Ahem.
#unknown You coming? We got to do this six more times today, with a lot of miles in between.
#unknown I'd like to finish before dark.
#unknown This freaking guy, I tell you what.
#unknown It's like Scarface had sex with Mister Rogers or something.
#unknown Who does this, you know? Your boy Heisenberg.
#unknown Thought we had him already.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Keep dreaming.
#unknown Yeah, no.
#unknown Getz busted him a few months back.
#unknown Yeah, well, no offense to Detective Doogie Howser there, but all he caught was a dipshit lifer by the name of Jimmy InNOut.
#unknown This one He's your Heisenberg? Yeah, I believe he is.
#unknown So what are you thinking? Rival drug gang taking out the mastermind? Any names I should check out? I wish I could help you there.
#unknown Only two people I know connected with the blue stuff.
#unknown Uh, one is a beaniewearing jizz stain by the name of Brandon Mayhew Street name, uh, Badger.
#unknown Definitely another player.
#unknown The other one is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown He and I have a history.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You see Pinkman as a shooter? That would surprise me.
#unknown Well, we got a composite of a person of interest.
#unknown It's a guy the neighbors saw at Boetticher's place right after the shooting.
#unknown Ehsorry.
#unknown No, hang on to it, just in case.
#unknown Then we got a couple of prints we're hoping to I.
#unknown D.
#unknown If I get any kind of hit, I'll keep you in the loop on that.
#unknown You know, uh, Tim, look, I appreciate what you're doing, really Uh, you know, keeping me involved and all, but, uh, you know, finding this guy Heisenberg dead like this I have to say, it, uh kind of feels like closure to me, you know? Hank, you really are a big help here.
#unknown No, I know.
#unknown I get it, really.
#unknown But I'm done.
#unknown Oh, no.
#unknown You don't need to do that.
#unknown This is why I'm out here, right? To be, like, your backup? Uhhuh.
#unknown So if I'm out here in a guardtype capacity to watch over the money, that means I need, like, a gun, right? Nope.
#unknown I mean, isn't that, like, completely idiotic for me to be out here without a gun? I mean, you haven't said dick about what I'm supposed to be doing here, and I'm supposed to do it without a gun? How does that even make sense? What? I can smoke, right? Not a chance.
#unknown Uhh Buhbuhbuhbuh buhbuhbuhbuh.
#unknown Fallacies   Fallacies   One for you and two for me  Uhh.
#unknown It's finally hitting me what the The plan is here.
#unknown It's to bore me to death, so mission accomplished because it's totally working.
#unknown Great job.
#unknown You know, I really do get what's going on with all the dead drops and bags of cash.
#unknown I mean, my boys had the exact same system when I was running things.
#unknown My crew.
#unknown Nowhere near the same cheese you guys are slinging, but same theory To maintain separation between dealer and supplier, reduce risk, et cetera.
#unknown Look, don't you think it would be good if there was some back and forth communication here? You got me riding shotgun to every dark anal recess of this state.
#unknown Be nice if you clued me in a little.
#unknown I mean, I'm here to do a job, right? And, I mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy, then you should just tell me what the hell's up.
#unknown What? You are not the guy.
#unknown You're not capable of being the guy.
#unknown I had a guy, but now I don't.
#unknown You are not the guy.
#unknown Then what the hell am I doing here? I don't know.
#unknown It's not my call.
#unknown I just do what I'm told, and now you're gonna do what you're told, which is to sit here, shut up, and stay in the car till we finish our pickups.
#unknown You got it? Oh.
#unknown We having second thoughts? Every hour of every day.
#unknown Let me tell you, that is perfectly normal.
#unknown But your expectations are realistic.
#unknown You have a good, solid business plan.
#unknown I'm feeling very confident.

#unknown There can't be any mistakes like before.
#unknown There has to be complete honesty.
#unknown I'm all for that.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Well, then, uh, how about a drink to celebrate? Well Well, we own a bigass car wash now.
#unknown We do.
#unknown I guess that merits a celebration.
#unknown Nothing too expensive.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Nonfancy liquor it is.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Just as long as it gets the job done.
#unknown Oop.

#unknown Jesse? Where's Jesse? I need him.
#unknown You people have me down here trying to complete a twoman operation by myself! It's unacceptable.
#unknown It's dangerous and counterproductive.
#unknown Jesse operates the forklift, not me.
#unknown That's just one of the many, many things he does around the lab that keeps us on schedule, so I suggest that you get him back down here as soon as you p Are you listening to me? Hello! Where do you want it? This is it, right? Last stop? Last stop? Hey, I've been counting, yo.
#unknown No more pickups after Fallacies fallacies.
#unknown Fallacies, fallacies.

#unknown All right? They, like, blocked the alley, and they were going to rip us off, man.
#unknown I didn't have a choice, okay? I had to put it in reverse, slam into the guy's car, and just I saw.
#unknown Ah, Jesus.
#unknown I just I don't know.
#unknown Go ahead, kid.
#unknown Smoke up.

#unknown Mmm.

#unknown Good morning, son.
#unknown You want me to pour you some juice? I'll take coffee.
#unknown Didn't know you started drinking coffee.

#unknown I also started tying my own shoelaces, too, all by myself.
#unknown Go grab a mug.
#unknown Milk? Sugar? Just black.
#unknown Black.
#unknown I like it.
#unknown Uh, hey, Dad, I, uh I I just got to say, um I I just wanted to say that it's really cool to have you here.

#unknown She She said that? Yeah.
#unknown Tuesday, is it? Huh.
#unknown How about that? Jesse.
#unknown Jesse! Yo, what's up? What are you doing? Uh, breaking ice.
#unknown I mean, what are you What are you doing here? Where's your car? Mike dropped me off.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse! What happened yesterday? Where were you? I was out with Mike helping him make pickups.
#unknown Picking up what? Cash.
#unknown Dead drops.
#unknown Mike made the pickups, and I guarded them.
#unknown You? Guarded Mike? What is this, some kind of a joke? Hey, you know what? Two dudes tried to rob us, and I saved the stash.
#unknown I took care of business, just like I'm taking care of business right now.
#unknown You want to stand there dicking around, or you want to suit up and get to work? Get in gear, yo, if you want to do this because I'm meeting up with Mike this afternoon.
#unknown What, again? Why? Guess I have two jobs now.
#unknown May I take your order? Any injuries? Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.
#unknown It all went like you thought it would, more or less.
#unknown I will, of course, reimburse you to the damage to your vehicles.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Questions? Uhhuh.
#unknown More than a few, yeah.
#unknown But I know better than to ask.
#unknown Anyway, it was like you wanted.
#unknown The kid's a hero.
#unknown Poopoopoopoopoo Just the idea of owning a car wash seems daunting, but I had to warn myself Who is just the most beautiful little girl in the world? I think it's you.
#unknown So coming into a business like this that's up and running, fully operational, puts us way ahead of the game.
#unknown You know, we're still going to have some change over time I think it's you.
#unknown Yeah, I do.
#unknown But we do have a staff in place, so, you know, luckily, we'll be able to hold on to most of Bogdan's employees.
#unknown We might lose a few to the Ultra Wash across town, though.
#unknown They're making a grab, I hear.
#unknown You going to put the kid to work? I got school.
#unknown I'm not talking about you.
#unknown I'm talking about your baby sister.
#unknown I wouldn't let you near my car.
#unknown Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.
#unknown You should put Holly on the sign.
#unknown Like a mascot? Like the Gerber baby.
#unknown I would get my car washed there every day if I saw her face out front.
#unknown What about me? The goal is to bring customers in, not scare them away, so Walt, there's another bottle in the kitchen.
#unknown Just help yourself.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Uh, maybe we could roll uncle Hank through the car wash.
#unknown He could be the first customer.
#unknown The wipedown crew would clean you up good.
#unknown See this, son? I got your wipedown right here, pal.
#unknown Hank, can you just maybe get through one meal without you saying something disgusting? So what are you going to do with Holly all day? You can't take her to work with all those chemicals and migrants hanging around.
#unknown Marie What? That can't be safe.
#unknown Fortunately, there is, just five minutes away from the car wash, there is the top child care center in the city.
#unknown The National Child Care Association gives it really high ratings, so that's quite a relief, and, you know, it's just a walk away if we need it.
#unknown I got to tell you, I'm just I'm really, really impressed.
#unknown I mean, you came together on this, and I'm really happy that it's working out for you.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown It was a little scary, but it, uh, needed to be done.
#unknown And, uh, we get possession of the keys tomorrow.
#unknown Oh, that's awesome.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I can't wait to see what kind of car I'll get for my birthday, now with all this money rolling in.
#unknown I think you've been spending too much time around your uncle Hank.
#unknown The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
#unknown Right, uncle Hank? Squeaky and greasy.
#unknown That's you, my friend.
#unknown Hey, uh, Nick the Greek, you going to share that bottle or what? Oh.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Who's Nick the Greek? Nick the Greek.
#unknown He was a famous bigtime card player.
#unknown Hank, that's not funny.
#unknown What? It's a compliment.
#unknown Well, that's even worse, then.
#unknown You're giving positive reinforcement to behavior that Walt is working very, very hard to change.
#unknown Right, Skyler? Yeah.
#unknown I don't see how it's bad, Dad, just raking in the beaucoup bucks now.
#unknown You know, I just, uh, think maybe we could change the subject? Yeah.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown You know.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Hey, uncle Hank, what about that case you were looking at with that crazy singing guy? Ah, I'm off that.
#unknown I I gave my assessment to the APD, and I'm done.
#unknown The case of the crazy singing guy.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Sounds like an Encyclopedia Brown story, doesn't it? Crazy is Is Is, uh, is the wrong word.
#unknown This guy Gale Boetticher, he was, uh, he was eccentric.
#unknown I mean, a real character, you know? He's, uh, he's dead now, you know.
#unknown Huh.
#unknown Who was he? He was a meth cook.
#unknown Uh, he was a meth chef.
#unknown I mean, we're talking five stars Candles and white tablecloths.
#unknown Hey, I can't believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth, but he was a genius, plain and simple.
#unknown I mean, uh, boy, if you applied that big brain of his to something good, I don't know, who knows what could have helped humanity or something like that, you know? I mean, how many actual geniuses are there in the world, right? If he'd kind of taken his life in a different direction, who knows? Hank, not to tell you your business, but I'm not sure I agree.
#unknown What do you mean? Well, I mean, you showed me that notebook and from what I saw And this is just my humble opinion From what I saw on those papers genius? Not so much.
#unknown I mean, there was no reasoning, no deductions in those pages.
#unknown To my eye, all this brilliance looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying Probably of someone else's work.
#unknown Believe me, I've been around enough students to know.
#unknown Ah, this genius of yours maybe he's still out there.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown Hey, babe.
#unknown Uh, Tim stopped by.
#unknown He brought over some file boxes on that case.
#unknown Thought I'd take another peek.
#unknown That's great.
#unknown Sorry about the mess.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Don't be.
#unknown You want me to make some coffee? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, that would be good.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown You find something? Oh, just this This guy I'm looking at.
#unknown You know, everything he He He buys and eats is organic, fair trade, vegan.
#unknown Since when do vegans eat fried chicken?
