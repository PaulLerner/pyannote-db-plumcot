#unknown Chemistry.
#unknown It is the study of what? Anyone? Ben.
#unknown Chemicals.
#unknown Chemicals! No! Chemistry is Well, technically, chemistry is the study of matter.
#unknown But I prefer to see it as the study of change.
#unknown Now just just think about this.
#unknown Electrons.
#unknown They change their energy levels.
#unknown Molecules.
#unknown Molecules change their bonds.
#unknown Elements.
#unknown They combine and change into compounds.
#unknown Well, that's that's all of life.
#unknown Right? I mean, it's just It's the constant.
#unknown It's the cycle.
#unknown It's solution, dissolution, just over and over and over.

#unknown It's not gonna bite you, all right? Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he? Hey, Walt.
#unknown Everybody listen up, listen up, listen up! I'm gonna give a toast.
#unknown A little toast to my brotherinlaw.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin, but we're not gonna hold that against you.
#unknown Because your heart's in the right place, man.
#unknown Your heart's in the right place.
#unknown We love you, man.
#unknown We love you.
#unknown Everybody! To Walt! Na zdorovje! Na zdorovje! Hey, turn on Channel 3.
#unknown At which point we apprehended three individuals and placed them into custody.
#unknown I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque District Office resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine being taken off the streets.
#unknown Were any shots fired? No, ma'am.
#unknown Our agents took the suspects by surprise.
#unknown Damn, the TV does add ten pounds.
#unknown Ten pounds? Hey, sit and spin.
#unknown Both of you.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown What? Sorry.
#unknown You didn't see that.
#unknown So charming.
#unknown This is clearly an ongoing operation, one which was well organized Hank, how much money is that? It's about 700 grand.
#unknown That's a pretty good haul, huh? As I say, it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque when we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade.
#unknown But that's unusual, isn't it, that kind of cash? Well, it's not the most we ever took.
#unknown It's easy money until we catch you.
#unknown Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ridealong.
#unknown You can watch us knock down a meth lab.
#unknown Get a little excitement in your life.
#unknown Well, someday.
#unknown Which one's this? That fauxLalique vase I picked up at the SuperSwap.
#unknown How's it doing? I met my reserve, and there's still two minutes.
#unknown What's up? You tell me, birthday boy.
#unknown Oh, hey, so what's up for Saturday? Car wash.
#unknown Bogdan says he needs me.
#unknown Until what time? Noon? 1ish? Probably 2, more like it.
#unknown And then what after that? Actually I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos.
#unknown The visitor center has an exhibit on It's really supposed to be  You're not gonna paint?  I'll paint.
#unknown It's just that this part of this exhibition on the Mars Rover photographs are The detail really is just supposed to be amazing.
#unknown It's just that I really need you to paint at some point.
#unknown I mean, the sooner that back bedroom gets finished.
#unknown And I'd do it myself, except you said you don't want me  standing on the stepladder.
#unknown I'll paint.

#unknown It's just like a chest cold.
#unknown Could be some low blood sugar as well.
#unknown I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning, honestly.
#unknown Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just drop me off at a corner somewhere? No.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.
#unknown Take a couple of deep breaths for me.
#unknown Is there anybody you want us to contact for you? God, no.
#unknown Lean forward for me, would you? Mr.
#unknown White, are you a smoker? No.

#unknown Well, I'll check with the bank and maybe the post office, if they lost it or something.
#unknown Yeah, let me look into that.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Thank you.

#unknown See it? Not the twostory one.
#unknown The one next to it.
#unknown The kind of I don't know, what do you call that?  Green?  Sage.
#unknown Sage.
#unknown What, do you work at the fucking Pottery Barn? Sage.
#unknown That's the word for it.
#unknown My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is green? Cheese dick.
#unknown I know that one.
#unknown How 'bout that? Anyway, it's the sage one.
#unknown See it? So what tells you it's a meth lab? Star snitch says some dude goes by Cap'n Cook lives up to his name in there.
#unknown Says he always adds a dash of chili powder.
#unknown Ah, you exuberant Mexicans.
#unknown Captain Cook, that's a white boy's name.
#unknown Dopey as hell, too.
#unknown Yeah? Tell you what.
#unknown I got 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.
#unknown All right.

#unknown All right.
#unknown School bus is clear.
#unknown Got the green light.
#unknown Copy that.

#unknown Meth labs are nasty on a good day.
#unknown You mix that wrong, you got mustard gas.
#unknown Phosphine gas.
#unknown I think.

#unknown One whiff will kill you.
#unknown That's why the respirators.
#unknown House is clear.
#unknown One suspect in custody.
#unknown Copy that.
#unknown The suspect, might he be of the Latino persuasion? Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.
#unknown Asian! Pay up, sucker.

#unknown Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10.
#unknown Cheer up, Gomey.
#unknown You people still got J.
#unknown Lo.
#unknown Hank, do you think I might get to go inside? See the actual lab? Yeah.

#unknown Stay here a minute.
#unknown God.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Pinkman? It's me.
#unknown I'm alone.
#unknown How'd you find me? You're still in our filing system.
#unknown So your aunt owns this place, right? I own it.
#unknown No one's looking for you.
#unknown Why are you here? I was curious.
#unknown Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn't picture that.
#unknown There's a lot of money in it, huh? I don't know what you're talking about.
#unknown No?  Not a clue.
#unknown Cap'n Cook? That's not you? Like I said, no one is looking for you.
#unknown Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bowl winder about getting right with Jesus by turning myself in  Not really.
#unknown High school was a long time ago.
#unknown You ain't Welcome Back Kotter, so step off.
#unknown No speeches.
#unknown Short speech.
#unknown You lost your partner today.
#unknown What's his name? Emilio? Emilio is going to prison.
#unknown The DEA took all your money, your lab.
#unknown You got nothing.
#unknown Square 1.
#unknown But you know the business.
#unknown And I know the chemistry.
#unknown I'm thinking maybe you and I could partner up.
#unknown You want to cook crystal meth? You? You and, uh and me? That's right.
#unknown Either that or I turn you in.
#unknown What the hell is this? Damned if I know.
#unknown I described it as mosaic folk art.
#unknown Somebody bought it?  Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.
#unknown $14.
#unknown 00 plus shipping.
#unknown Yes! At this rate, in 50 or 60 years, you'll be rich.
#unknown So how goes the novel? It's not a novel, actually, which I have You're not writing a novel? You told me you were.
#unknown No.
#unknown Short stories.
#unknown I said that if eventually I have enough good ones that maybe I'll try and publish another collection.
#unknown Those really didn't sell.
#unknown I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.
#unknown Yeah, well, maybe so.
#unknown Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you.
#unknown No.
#unknown I mean, I'm not at that stage where I No.
#unknown Open offer.
#unknown So what's up with Walt lately? What do you mean? He's fine.
#unknown He just seems, I don't know quieter than usual.
#unknown Turning 50 is a big deal.
#unknown I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40.
#unknown You're gonna be a complete basket case.
#unknown So it's midlife crisis.
#unknown No, he's just quiet.
#unknown How's the sex?  Marie, Jesus.
#unknown Guess that answers that.
#unknown You just gonna sit there? This.
#unknown Look at this.
#unknown Kjeldahlstyle recovery flask, Very rare.
#unknown You got your usual paraphernalia: Griffin beakers, your Erlenmeyer flask.
#unknown But the pièce de résistance: a round bottom boiling flask.
#unknown Well, I cook in one of those.
#unknown The big one.
#unknown One of these? No, this is a volumetric flask.
#unknown You wouldn't cook in one of these.
#unknown Yeah, I do.
#unknown No, you don't.
#unknown A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration.
#unknown You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask.
#unknown That's what a boiling flask is for.
#unknown Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class? No.
#unknown You flunked me.
#unknown Remember?  No wonder.
#unknown Prick.
#unknown Now let me tell you something else.
#unknown This ain't chemistry, this is art.
#unknown Cooking is art.
#unknown And the shit I cook is the bomb, so don't be telling me.
#unknown The shit you cook is shit.
#unknown I saw your setup.
#unknown Ridiculous.
#unknown You and I will not make garbage.
#unknown We will produce a chemically pure and stable product that performs as advertised.
#unknown No adulterants.
#unknown No baby formula.
#unknown No chili powder.
#unknown No, no, chili P is my signature.
#unknown Not anymore.
#unknown Yeah, well, we'll see about that.
#unknown What the hell is this?  Lab safety equipment.
#unknown We're also gonna have an emergency eye wash station.
#unknown These chemicals and their fumes are toxic, in case you didn't know that.
#unknown Well, you can dress up like a faggot if you want.
#unknown Not me.
#unknown Listen, this stuff doesn't stay more than a day.
#unknown What? I thought we were gonna cook here.
#unknown No, we're not gonna cook here.
#unknown Okay, this is my house.
#unknown I don't shit where I eat.
#unknown Well, then, where are we gonna work? You tell me.
#unknown This is your deal.
#unknown You want to smoke it up, smoke it up at your house.
#unknown Nah, I didn't think so.
#unknown Oh, well.
#unknown Well what if we rented one of those selfstorage places, you know, those little orange garages, worked out of there? No.
#unknown They're on to that.
#unknown They got dogs that sniff around.
#unknown RV.
#unknown That's what you want.
#unknown What, like a Winnebago? Yeah.
#unknown I know a dude who wants to sell his.
#unknown He just goes camping with it.
#unknown But a mobile meth lab? That'd be the bomb.
#unknown I mean, drive way out in the boonies.
#unknown Be all evasive.
#unknown Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.
#unknown My guy wants 85.
#unknown This is all the money I have in the world.

#unknown It's weird is all, okay? It doesn't compute.
#unknown Listen if you've gone crazy or something I mean, if you've if you've gone crazy or depressed, I'm just saying that's something I need to know about.
#unknown Okay? I mean, that affects me.
#unknown I am awake.
#unknown What? Buy the RV.
#unknown We start tomorrow.
#unknown How's it coming in there? Fine.
#unknown Do you want me or your dad? Dad.

#unknown You should get 'em if you like 'em, okay? Why don't you just hang out here for a second? I'll be right back.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf in my brandnew bigboy pants.
