walter_white  I didn't want to act like it, but I was terrified
walter_white  All that week, all I could think of was how they were actually going to cut me open and take out a part of me that was with me my entire life.
walter_white  I couldn't get that image out of my head.
walter_white  I think the scariest part was when They took me into preop,
walter_white  lying there, waiting for them to anesthetize you
walter_white  knowing that You may never wake up again.
walter_white  chuckles Actually, what I really remember about that day is driving to the hospital.
walter_white  Skyler, you remember me wanting to drive that day?
walter_white  Anyway, there we are.
walter_white  We're driving up Central, and we hit every green light
walter_white  I mean, every single light that we hit sheew green.
walter_white  When does that
walter_white  happen? Just like bang, bang, green the entire way.
walter_white  And the whole time, all I could think about was"
walter_white  Why today?
walter_white " Why can't I just spend a few extra minutes in the car with my family?"
Walter_White  I never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life.
