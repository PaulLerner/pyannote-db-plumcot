#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Uh Can you tell us anything or any details? Right now, all we know is two men ambushed Hank.
#unknown They didn't have any I.
#unknown D.
#unknown on them.
#unknown Probably Mexican nationals.
#unknown Their tattoos indicated an affiliation with the drug cartel.
#unknown Why did they attack Hank? We're not sure yet.
#unknown It could be in relation to an investigation that Hank was working, or it could be a message to the DEA in general.
#unknown They had an ax.
#unknown The cartels tend to be dramatic.
#unknown Oh, Jesus.
#unknown Where are they? I mean, did they Hank got both of them.
#unknown He killed one outright, and the other one's upstairs in critical condition.
#unknown Your brotherinlaw's one tough son of a bitch to take them both out, considering he didn't even have his gun.
#unknown He didn't have his gun? Why didn't Hank have his gun? Marie, the assault charge.
#unknown I had to suspend Hank pending the investigation.
#unknown That means I had to take away his weapon.
#unknown [muttering] It's standard procedure.
#unknown No one Okay, All right.
#unknown Listen.
#unknown If you would have all listened to him right from the start, and let him arrest that little degenerate, he wouldn't have had to take things into his own hands, and he would have had a gun and defended himself.
#unknown Marie, let's just No.
#unknown Just It's their fault.
#unknown He didn't have a gun.
#unknown Honey, this isn't helping you.
#unknown You.
#unknown What kind of partner are you? You were supposed to back him up, and where were you? Where were you? Texas.
#unknown And you.
#unknown You're supposed to protect your agents instead of taking their guns, not supporting them, not backing them up Marie.
#unknown Marie.
#unknown when they Honey, let's just go and sit down, okay? I'm not doing anything until these two get the hell out of here.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown Sorry Go.
#unknown You are not welcome here.
#unknown The DEA is not welcome here.
#unknown Honey.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Let's go sit down.
#unknown It's not just them.
#unknown It's you, Walt.
#unknown This Pinkman that Hank was looking for Hank would have never even heard his name if you hadn't bought marijuana from him.
#unknown Marie Do you ever think about that, Walt? Do you? Do you ever think about everything that you have put him through? [Skyler] Marie, stop.
#unknown You're upset, and you're looking for someone to blame, and it's understandable, but don't blame Walt.
#unknown It's not his fault.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Sweetheart.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Don't [sobbing] It's okay.

#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown [grunt] Yo, yo, yo! Jesse Pinkman in the house! Oh, my dear God.
#unknown [laughs] Wow.
#unknown [beep] Walter White to the nearest courtesy phone.
#unknown Walter White, please pick up a courtesy phone.
#unknown [Jesse] Yo.
#unknown We working sometime this year? What the hell are you thinking? Why are you calling me here? I tried your cell, and it went straight to voice mail.
#unknown How else am I supposed to get hold of you? You aren't.
#unknown Look, man, it's been a whole day.
#unknown How long is this grieving process? Just put a clock on it for me.
#unknown All's I'm saying is we have a schedule, right? My family comes before your schedule.
#unknown Dude, it's not my schedule.
#unknown We have responsibilities here.
#unknown I'll get there when I get there.
#unknown You know what? Whatever.
#unknown I'll just cook on my own.
#unknown You will do no such thing.
#unknown Why not? Well, uh, for starters, you aren't the least bit familiar with any of the equipment.
#unknown There's got to be some sort of manual, right? And I can read.
#unknown Jesse, touch nothing.
#unknown Yo, stop treating me I'm like your assistant.
#unknown I'm not your bitch to order around.
#unknown We're partners.
#unknown Remember? I need you to sit patiently and wait, and I will be there as soon as I can.
#unknown Thank you very much for your kind words.
#unknown We We really do appreciate that.
#unknown What, is your wife there? Uh, yes.
#unknown Yes, she is, and she would be happy to know that you asked about her.
#unknown And please do keep us in your thoughts.
#unknown Hey, tell your douchebag brotherinlaw to head towards the light.
#unknown So I'm thinking, um, maybe we should go get everybody some breakfast.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That sounds good.
#unknown Do you know who that was? You know, these eggs are really not too bad.
#unknown Look at that.
#unknown Look at what? At what? This.
#unknown These spots.
#unknown This fork is absolutely filthy.
#unknown Tell me you see this.
#unknown You've got good eyes.
#unknown Look at that.
#unknown Marie, those are just water spots.
#unknown Fork is fine.
#unknown Those are not water spots.
#unknown That's dirt.
#unknown This silverware's obviously not been cleaned.
#unknown It's covered in germs from someone else's mouth.
#unknown God knows what.
#unknown Seriously, Aunt Marie, it's water spots.
#unknown Ours at home aren't any better.
#unknown Yours at home are irrelevant.
#unknown We're in a hospital.
#unknown They need to be held to a higher standard.
#unknown They have a responsibility.
#unknown Well, I'm not actually sure if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies as being part of a hospital.
#unknown It's in the same building.
#unknown It's all under the same roof.
#unknown Do you think that sick people aren't eating with this bacteriainfected silverware? My Gpd, how are you supposed to survive this death trap? [Skyler] Marie.
#unknown I survived.
#unknown I had my lumpectomy at this hospital.
#unknown Remember that? Remember how scared we all were? Whoo.
#unknown I didn't want to act like it, but I was terrified.
#unknown All that week, all I could think of was how they were actually going to cut me open and take out a part of me that was with me my entire life.
#unknown I couldn't get that image out of my head.
#unknown I think the scariest part was when They took me into preop, lying there, waiting for them to anesthetize you, knowing that You may never wake up again.
#unknown [chuckles] Actually, what I really remember about that day is driving to the hospital.
#unknown Skyler, you remember me wanting to drive that day? Yeah.
#unknown Anyway, there we are.
#unknown We're driving up Central, and we hit every green light I mean, every single light that we hit sheew green.
#unknown [chuckling] When does that happen? Just like bang, bang, green the entire way.
#unknown And the whole time, all I could think about was "Why today? Why? "Why can't I just spend a few extra minutes in the car with my family?" I never wanted to be stuck in traffic so bad in my life.
#unknown At least I was with my family.
#unknown I had that.
#unknown Anyway, I survived this place.
#unknown And I'm not half the man your husband is.
#unknown [phone buzzes] Yes? [Man speaking Spanish] I was going to ask you the same question.
#unknown I heard they they attacked a DEA agent.
#unknown Why would they do that? I didn't order this, and my men would never do this on their own.
#unknown Someone gave the goahead.
#unknown Are you accusing me? I'm just saying they wouldn't act on their own.
#unknown I am not in the habit of picking my own pocket.
#unknown I assume that the next shipment will be delayed.
#unknown Any thoughts on when it might arrive? A week, a month.
#unknown There's too much focus on the border.
#unknown We lay low for the time being.
#unknown We lay low, and then we get the real story from my man who survived.
#unknown Your man is in custody.
#unknown He's innocent until proven guilty.
#unknown Correct? I'll get him the best lawyer, and then we'll learn the truth.
#unknown Well, keep me apprised.
#unknown Any time you've got that close proximity to the spine, there's always going to be cause for concern, but, as I say, it's really too soon to tell.
#unknown He's out of surgery, at least, which is Out of surgery, on his way to revery.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Where's that? Unfortunately, you can't see him just yet.
#unknown We're gonna have to wait for him to stabilize.
#unknown How long will that take? I can't really say.
#unknown Could be hours, but we'll let you know just as soon as you could see him.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Um, maybe we should get you home for a couple hours? Get some rest? I'm not going anywhere.
#unknown Me, neither.
#unknown Well, is anyone else dying to brush their teeth, or is it just me? What if I ran over to the house and picked up a few things? Marie? I could swing by your place.
#unknown That would be great.
#unknown Thanks, Walt.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown [Woman on P.
#unknown A.
#unknown ] Dr.
#unknown Bender? Dr.
#unknown Bender.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Walt.

#unknown I'll take it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Hey, guys, this is Hank's brotherinlaw, Walt.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown We were just swapping Hank stories.
#unknown Oh, well, that could that could go on all day.
#unknown God knows, there's a million of them.
#unknown Meanwhile Miserable piece of shit.
#unknown Guy who shot him, the one that's left, he's up there, got the painkillers going on, resting comfortably.
#unknown Your tax dollars at work.
#unknown You ought to see what Hank did to that bastard.
#unknown Want to see? Come on, let me show you.

#unknown Operator.
#unknown This is Walter White.
#unknown I'll connect you.
#unknown [beep] [Jesse] Yo, we got problems, big ones.
#unknown Reverend, so nice of you to call Again.
#unknown Turn your phone on already.
#unknown You know, I will definitely look into that.
#unknown I'll tell you what.
#unknown Why don't I just call you right back on my cell phone.
#unknown Okay? I told you to wait.
#unknown I don't know how many more ways I could say it.
#unknown Yeah, damn, I was waiting, and then that creepy, quiet guy showed up.
#unknown Gus came by? Not him, man.
#unknown Apparently I'm not worthy of meeting him.
#unknown It was the other one, the one that I'm qualified to speak to.
#unknown Then he started asking questions, too, like why I haven't cooked anything.
#unknown We have a quota.
#unknown It's due tomorrow.
#unknown Do you seriously not care, or what? Because that guy, he's got, like, the dead eyes.
#unknown Let me ask you something.
#unknown Do you remember when we were out in the desert with Tuco? Oh, you mean when he put a machinegun to my head? Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
#unknown Why? No.
#unknown He kept He kept saying that that someone was coming up from Mexico to get us.
#unknown Do you remember? Now, who was that? What the hell has this even got to do with Look, I don't know.
#unknown It was, um uh His cousins.
#unknown Right, Jesse? It was his cousins.
#unknown Yeah, cousins.
#unknown Whatever, man.
#unknown Why? Any news? [Marie] No change.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, I I didn't know whose toothbrushes were whose, so I I just stopped by the drugstore.
#unknown Thank God for travel sizes, right? Thank you.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Oh, I think I'm going to go wash my face.
#unknown I'm going crazy.
#unknown Do you want to come? Yeah.
#unknown I got candy bars.
#unknown Oh, um Is this what you were asking for? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah? Yeah, I I skimmed through it.
#unknown Looks interesting.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Uncle Hank gave it to me.
#unknown What's it about? Pablo Escobar, this big drug guy in the '80s.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, I remember seeing him on the news.
#unknown Well, it's more about the guys who investigated him and tried to bring him down.
#unknown Some of them were DEA, you know? Uncle Hank said that they were worth learning about, that everybody knows who Pablo Escobar is, but nobody knows about the guys that brought him down.
#unknown I guess I never thought about it.
#unknown [chuckles] He said that good guys never get ink like the bad guys do.
#unknown [chuckles] So he gave it to me.
#unknown Figured I'd read it.
#unknown [cell phone ringing] Uh, I I need to I'll be right back, okay? No, I assure you.
#unknown We are hard at work.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown [Gus] So I can expect delivery by tomorrow as scheduled.
#unknown Well, uh No.
#unknown Unfortunately Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to keep our schedule this week.
#unknown But not for lack of trying.
#unknown Is there something I should know? Well, to be completely honest with you Gale really screwed us up.
#unknown I mean, not on purpose, of course, but he just he set us way back, and we've been playing catchup ever since.
#unknown And I've had to be out running errands and trying to keep us on target.
#unknown Some of the equipment wasn't calibrated correctly and Well, it's just all very technical and boring, but rest assured that that we will do whatever it takes.
#unknown It has my total attention.
#unknown We'll cook through the weekend if necessary.
#unknown We will have 400 pounds for you by next week.
#unknown I have your word on that? You do.
#unknown You have my word on that.
#unknown Thank you for the update.
#unknown Any news? Nah, I'm just just wandering.
#unknown How's everybody doing? Well, as well as can be expected.
#unknown It's this not knowing that's the hardest part, I think.
#unknown Anything new on these guys? Who they are? What they wanted? No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.
#unknown Steve Do you think there could maybe be others? Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.
#unknown That was their one shot, and they blew it.
#unknown So, no.
#unknown No way.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown I'd love to walk in there and shoot that bastard right in the head.
#unknown Me, too.
#unknown [cell phone rings] Yeah.
#unknown Oh, yeah? Great.
#unknown We'll be right down.
#unknown Food's here.

#unknown It'll really help.
#unknown Again, I can't express how sorry I am.
#unknown As it happens, I actually met Agent Schrader.
#unknown [Marie] Really? Our fun run, a couple months ago.
#unknown Mr.
