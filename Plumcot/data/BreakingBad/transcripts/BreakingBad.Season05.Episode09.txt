#unknown Hi.
#unknown Here you go.
#unknown There's complimentary coffee inside.
#unknown Have an A1 day.
#unknown Air fresheners are high margin, right? At 30 cents wholesale, yeah.
#unknown Right.
#unknown So I'm thinking we reorganize the display, separate the food scents from the nature scents.
#unknown I mean, does bubble gum belong anywhere near ocean spray? No.
#unknown And pine is still our biggest seller, right? So maybe we move that over to the cash register by the fivehour energy drink.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Speaking of the business, the story comes first.
#unknown The story is is that we are car wash owners, pure and simple.
#unknown But if our story is that the car wash is successful, what do successful car wash owners do? They buy more car washes.
#unknown Listen.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown We'll be laundering that money for years.
#unknown Decades.
#unknown Wouldn't two be better than one? Well, there's gentle hands over by Kirtland.
#unknown I do love that location.
#unknown I'll think about it.
#unknown Yeah.

#unknown Have an A1 day.
#unknown Please give this to your car wash professional, and have an A1 day.
#unknown Good morning.
#unknown May I have your ticket, please? I knew there would be a drop in quality, but 68%? This is not what I agreed to.
#unknown I left a viable operation.
#unknown The rest was up to you.
#unknown May I have your ticket, please? I'm only asking for a few days.
#unknown A week at most.
#unknown Call it a tutorial.
#unknown That's the standard wash.
#unknown Fix this.
#unknown Get the ship back on course.
#unknown We'll make it worth your while.
#unknown That'll be 14.
#unknown 95, please.
#unknown Listen, this is a complicated situation.
#unknown There are a lot of moving parts.
#unknown None of which are my concern.
#unknown You're putting me in a box here.
#unknown You know what could happen.
#unknown Again, none of my concern.
#unknown There's your change.
#unknown And if you'll hand this to your car wash professional.

#unknown Listen  It'll only be a few more minutes.
#unknown There's some complimentary coffee, if you like.
#unknown What's up? Just wondering who washes a rental car.
#unknown Walt, who was that? She's a former business associate who wants me to go back.
#unknown And I won't.
#unknown Enrique, this one's finished.
#unknown Terminado.

#unknown Byebye.
#unknown Morning, Mrs.
#unknown Schrader.
#unknown Hey, guys.
#unknown What's going on?  Just dropping these off, ma'am.
#unknown Where would you like them?  Bring them around to the garage, guys.
#unknown I got it.
#unknown Have a good day.
#unknown You too.
#unknown Boss, Janice said to tell you a few of them might not have indexes.
#unknown We could give you a hand sorting through them.
#unknown No, I got it.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown All right.
#unknown See you, boss.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay, um  Your world is in flames   there ain't even a name   for the feelings you feel   as you watch it all burn   there's a girl in the distance   she's calling your name   but the name that she's calling   is not your name she calls   the word mule, the word mule, the word mule   but he's plowing the field   the word mule, the word mule, the word mule   but he's plowing the field   my friends, look out for hustlers   for preachers, for shysters   them silvertongued saints that pretend to do good   'cause they're geeks biting chicken heads off   with their witty rejoinders   they ain't nothing but greasy fast food   for the word mule, yeah, the word mule   good God, the word mule   he will eat them alive   the word mule, the word mule, the word mule   he's plowing the field  Dude, you are tripping.
#unknown I'm not dead.
#unknown I'm on the starship Enterprise, macking on Yeoman Rand, while the Andorian with the Disrupter's back on Talos Four or whatever.
#unknown What do you think all those sparkles and shit are? The transporters are breaking you apart, man.
#unknown Down to your molecules and bones.
#unknown They're making a copy.
#unknown That dude who comes out on the other side, he's not you.
#unknown He's a Color Xerox.
#unknown So you're telling me every time Kirk went into the transport, he was killing himself? So over the whole series, there was, like, 147 Kirks? At least.
#unknown Dude, yo, why do you think McCoy never likes to beam nowhere? 'Cause he's a doctor, bitch.
#unknown Look it up.
#unknown It's science.
#unknown I ever tell you about my Star Trek script? Star Trek script? Yeah.
#unknown I gotta write it down is all.
#unknown The Enterprise is five parsecs out of Rigel 12.
#unknown Nothing's going on, Neutral Zone is quiet, the crew is bored, so they put on a pieeating contest.
#unknown The whole crew's in the galley.
#unknown They're eating tulaberry pies  Tulaberry? Tulaberries.
#unknown From Gamma Quadrant, yo.
#unknown That's Voyager, dude.
#unknown Okay, blueberries then.
#unknown They're eating blueberry pies as fast as the replicator can churn them out.
#unknown Finally, it's down to just three Kirk, Spock, and Chekov.
#unknown Okay, Spock always wins these things.
#unknown How is Spock gonna beat Kirk, yo? Spock's like a toothbrush.
#unknown Look at Kirk.
#unknown He's got room to spare.
#unknown Spock has total vulcan control over his digestion.
#unknown You wanna hear this or not?  Yeah, yeah, go.
#unknown Okay, finally, Kirk he can't take it anymore.
#unknown He yorks.
#unknown Now it's just down to Chekov and Spock.
#unknown But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole fat stack of Quatloos riding on this, and he has figured out a way to win.
#unknown He's got Scotty back in the transporter room, locked in on Chekov's stomach.
#unknown Every time Chekov eats a pie, Scotty beams it right out of him.
#unknown Where is he sending them? The toilet? Space.
#unknown There's blueberries just floating out there, frozen, because it's in space, and Chekov is just shoveling them into his mouth, and Spock's like, "I can't believe this Russian is defeating me.
#unknown " Meanwhile, Scotty's in the transporter room fiddling with levers, when Lieutenant Uhura comes in, and she's got, you know, her big pointies.
#unknown And Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.
#unknown No.
#unknown Chekov screams.
#unknown He sprays blood out of his mouth.
#unknown Scotty beamed his guts into space! No way! Hey, man, where you going? You're missing the best part.
#unknown Just fill this out.
#unknown Bring it back to me.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown Yo! Ohhh.
#unknown You know you can't smoke that up in here.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Jesse Pinkman's out here smoking pot.
#unknown Give me a break, man.
#unknown Pinkman, he'll see you now.
#unknown Woody Harrelson, live and in person.
#unknown Pull up a bong and take a seat.
#unknown Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
#unknown Don't be doing that.
#unknown Uh, sorry to keep you on ice out there, kid.
#unknown If I'd known it was you, well Francesca.
#unknown I've warned her before.
#unknown One more time, and it's back to the DMV.
#unknown So, uh, are we on our own today? Barn door open.
#unknown "Barn door"? Oh.
#unknown So, uh, how is the maestro? Things have been quiet on this end.
#unknown I haven't seen him.
#unknown Just as well, probably.
#unknown That whole thing in the jails I mean, when they start to whack the lawyers, that's when I draw the line.
#unknown This goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut, and that goes to Mr.
#unknown and Mrs.
#unknown Albert Sharp.
#unknown It's up in White Horse.
#unknown It's 2 1/2 million each.
#unknown A total of five.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown and Mrs.
#unknown , uh, who? Drew Sharp's parents.
#unknown Drew Sharp that's the kid on TV.
#unknown The missing, uh So but why would you, uh Scratch that.
#unknown I don't know, and I don't wanna know.
#unknown Uh, thing is, what those folks want is to know what happened to their boy.
#unknown Sack full of cash on their doorstep that's just gonna raise more questions.
#unknown Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
#unknown That's Mike's granddaughter?  So this is Mike's money?  It's mine.
#unknown It's your money.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown And you're giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut It's what Mike wanted.
#unknown So you and Mike, uh You've been in touch? So we're just talking about charity? Yeah.
#unknown Okay, look.
#unknown You know, um, shelling out money to the ex and her little boy I kinda get it.
#unknown I mean, kinda.
#unknown But this This is a bridge too far.
#unknown I'm sorry to say, kid, but you're still gonna be two miracles short of sainthood.
#unknown Brass tacks, okay? My job is to advise.
#unknown And my advice is Come on, already.
#unknown Mike left one step ahead of the boys in blue, and you better believe his family's on the radar.
#unknown A couple million bucks shows up, they're gonna snatch it tout de suite.
#unknown The feds have already taken Kaylee's money twice.
#unknown What are you you going for a hat trick?  I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
#unknown No, no, no! I was just I was thinking out loud.
#unknown Enough bullshit, Saul.
#unknown Are you gonna do this or not? Yes, yes, absolutely.
#unknown I I live to serve.
#unknown And, kid, you might wanna think about cleaning up a little, getting some rest.
#unknown You've looked better.
#unknown Just get it done.
#unknown You know who this is? Don't hang up on me.
#unknown Yeah, there's a problem.
#unknown There's five million of them here in my office.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Don't.
#unknown Just hold onto it.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Ye Yes.
#unknown Calm down.
#unknown I'll handle it.
#unknown DÃ©jÃ  vu, huh? Jesus.
#unknown All right, look.
#unknown You wanna talk me through this? What you were thinking? What you asked Saul to do? I mean, come on.
#unknown It's just nonsensical.
#unknown I mean, do you You have any explanation at all? What? It's like you said.
#unknown It's It's blood money.
#unknown I s Jeez.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I said that.
#unknown I did.
#unknown But it was in in the heat of the moment.
#unknown I was trying to win an argument, all right? And I was wrong.
#unknown This is your money.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown You've earned it.
#unknown Drew Sharp.
#unknown That is a terrible memory, no doubt about it.
#unknown But, son you need to stop focusing on the darkness behind you.
#unknown The past is the past.
#unknown Nothing can change what we've done.
#unknown But now that's over.
#unknown You're out, and so am I.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown I'm done.
#unknown I've been out for about a month.
#unknown And there is nothing left for us to do except to try to live ordinary, decent lives.
#unknown Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut? She needs someone looking after her.
#unknown Mike is perfectly capable of looking after his own granddaughter.
#unknown I don't think so.
#unknown I don't think he is capable.
#unknown I don't think he's coming back.
#unknown What what are you saying? You doing what you did offing Mike's guys? If he was out there, you would have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life, and that's not how you do things.
#unknown So I think he's dead, and I think you know that.
#unknown I don't know that.
#unknown I don't.
#unknown Listen to me.
#unknown I did not kill Mike.
#unknown The last time that I saw him, he had his bag the one that I brought him and he got into his car, and he drove away.
#unknown And for all I know, he is alive and well.
#unknown And if and if he does come back, and he doesn't understand why I had to do what I did well, then, that's on me.
#unknown Jesse I need you to believe this.
#unknown It's not true.
#unknown It's just not.
#unknown So he's out there.
#unknown He's okay.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Mike is fine.
#unknown Wherever he is.
#unknown We both know that he can take care of himself.
#unknown And he's certainly capable to provide for his own family, okay? Jesse? I need you to believe me.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Like you said.
#unknown He's alive.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Mike's alive.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Well, you've gotta have a college counselor.
#unknown Are they bringing in someone new? I don't know.
#unknown Um, maybe she'll be back.
#unknown And what if she's not? What are you supposed to do? I mean, what's Louis gonna do?  He's he's not worried.
#unknown Oh, yeah, sure.
#unknown What's there to worry about? It's only college, right? Right.
#unknown College.
#unknown Nothing more important.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown You know, Uncle Hank's still not feeling well, so bowling's off tomorrow night.
#unknown Really? Really.
#unknown So you're spared a night out with the family.
#unknown You do not have to look so happy about it.
#unknown I'll be right back.
#unknown Um so if bowling's off, can I can I get a late curfew? Ah.
#unknown Ugh.
#unknown Are you gonna turn off the light? Have you seen Leaves Of Grass? Hmm? My book.
#unknown Walt Whitman.
#unknown Dark green hardcover? I didn't even know we had that.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown You don't think Junior You're kidding, right? Well, it'll show up.
#unknown What's wrong with Hank? Mm, it's a stomach bug, sounds like.
#unknown He hasn't been to work all week.
#unknown Well, good night.
#unknown Good night.
#unknown Mister, can you help me out? Spare some change? Hey.
#unknown Come back.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown I got something for you.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Take it.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown Just take it.
#unknown Take it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Anything you want us to tell Steve Gomez? He says he's worried about you.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Tell him I already got two grandmas.
#unknown Listen, tell everybody more work and less worry.
#unknown We better hit it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown See ya.
#unknown Hey, guys.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown How are you? Good to see you.
#unknown How you doing? Very good.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Well, you know.
#unknown I can't complain.
#unknown Hey, how's your son's arm, by the way? I was thinking about that.
#unknown It's back to 100%.
#unknown We're going to District.
#unknown It's gonna be exciting.
#unknown When? This Saturday? This Saturday morning.
#unknown I think first pitch is at 10:00 AM, so, uh  10:00.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Be there.
#unknown Should be a big crowd.
#unknown Guys, you're still on the clock here! Let's go! See you, Walt.
#unknown See you, Artie.
#unknown See you, Walt.
#unknown All right, Scott.
#unknown Be well.
#unknown They're good guys, huh? Yeah.
#unknown Well, it's good to see you up and about.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown How you feeling?  Well, you know, I've been better, but I don't know.
#unknown You Did you get to see a doctor? I mean, when one of these things lasts more than three days you really should get that checked.
#unknown Yeah, no, I I did and I'm fine.
#unknown I'm, uh I'm what they say on the upswing, you know? Mm.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Good to hear.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown When I heard you weren't going in to work, I Well, looks like you have the work coming to you.
#unknown Perks of being the boss, huh? Yeah, you know How's, uh how's things at the car wash?  Good.
#unknown Yeah? Yeah, really good.
#unknown Hey, did you have any of that potato salad?  I don't know.
#unknown Ma maybe.
#unknown Yeah, I mean, no one else got sick, so you probably shouldn't worry about it.
#unknown Well, Skyler will be very happy to hear that you're feeling better.
#unknown Which reminds me.
#unknown I better get back to it.
#unknown If there's anything I can do Feel better.
#unknown You know You're gonna laugh, but I have to ask you about this.
#unknown Believe it or not, I found this on my car.
#unknown I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it? Back when we were tracking him, just the two of us? You wouldn't know anything about this, would you, Hank? You okay? I gotta say, I don't like the way you're looking at me right now.
#unknown Ugh!  Hank  It was you.
#unknown All along, it was you! You son of a bitch.
#unknown You drove into traffic to keep me from that laundry.
#unknown Calm down.
#unknown That call I got telling me Marie was in the hospital that wasn't Pinkman.
#unknown You had my cell number.
#unknown You killed ten witnesses to save your sorry ass.
#unknown Listen to me  You bombed a nursing home.
#unknown Heisenberg.
#unknown Heisenberg! You lying, twofaced sack of shit.
#unknown Hank, look, I don't know where this is coming from, Hank, but just I swear to Christ, I will put you under the jail.
#unknown Just take a breath, okay? Just listen to yourself.
#unknown These wild accusations they could destroy our family.
#unknown And for what?  Damn, like you give a shit about family! Hank, my cancer is back.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Rot, you son of a bitch.
#unknown I'm sorry you feel that way.
#unknown I wanna beat this thing.
#unknown I do.
#unknown I'm back on chemo, and I am fighting like hell.
#unknown But the truth is in six months, you won't have someone to prosecute.
#unknown But even even if somehow you were able to convince anyone I was capable of doing these things, you and I both know I would never see the inside of a jail cell.
#unknown I'm a dying man who runs a car wash.
#unknown My right hand to God, that is all that I am.
#unknown What's the point? Have Skyler bring the kids here, and then we'll talk.
#unknown That is not going to happen.
#unknown I don't know who you are.
#unknown I don't even know who I'm talking to.
#unknown If that's true, if you don't know who I am then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.
#unknown
