#unknown Previously on Breaking Bad I can't help you get through this if you wont me what it is Walt did.
#unknown Two men are coming to kill you.
#unknown Come again.
#unknown Two men ambushed Hank.
#unknown There tattoos indicate an affiliation with the drug cartel.
#unknown You knew my brother when I was with the DEA.
#unknown I investigate everyone I do business.
#unknown I am sleeping with my boss and I don't know why.
#unknown What's up partner? This is my replacement? In the litlle village where I was born, life moved at a slower pace yet felt all the richer for it.
#unknown There, my two uncles were known far and wide for their delicious cooking.
#unknown They seasoned their zesty chicken using only the freshest herbs and spices.
#unknown People called them "Los Pollos Hermanos" the Chicken Brothers.
#unknown Today, we carry on their tradition in a manner that would make my uncleproud.
#unknown The finest ingredients are brought together with loving care then slowcooked to perfection.
#unknown Yes, the old ways are still best at Los Pollos Hermanos.
#unknown But don't take my word for it.
#unknown One taste and you'll know.
#unknown [theme] [beeping] [Jesse] Jesus, seriously.
#unknown Better over than under.
#unknown Over by a pound and a half.
#unknown I thought you were all, like, precise.
#unknown Whatever.
#unknown We'll just save it out till next week.
#unknown No.
#unknown We ship it asis.
#unknown What are we, running a charity? Come on, man, we're gonna take it out.
#unknown Leave it.
#unknown One batch, one ship.
#unknown Stop complicating things.
#unknown Why are you purposely giving him free meth? These bitches are bleeding us enough already.
#unknown You are paid extraordinarily well.
#unknown Why can't you just appreciate that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.
#unknown Hey, I been crunching numbers, all right? Oh, you've been crunching numbers? Yeah, I've been crunching numbers, and I don't gotta be a mathematician to figure out that this deal you made is bullshit.
#unknown We both earn Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know a million and a half each.
#unknown Whoopdedoo.
#unknown What's he getting? Huh? Say he's wholesaling at 40 large a pound.
#unknown That's probably high.
#unknown High.
#unknown Uh, what, for our stuff? That's what I was getting.
#unknown All right, look, say he's getting 40 a pound.
#unknown All right? for three months.
#unknown And, like, what happens at the end of the three months? Look, what whatever.
#unknown for three months.
#unknown That's 2400 pounds.
#unknown and I swear to God, I doublechecked this, like, 10 times [zips] All right? That is messed up, yo.
#unknown That is so messed up.
#unknown Fairnesswise, I can't even Jesse, you are now a millionaire, and you're complaining? What world do you live in? One where the dudes who are actually doing all the work ain't getting fisted.
#unknown What is going on with you lately? What's happened to you? Hang on, can't we just Hey, we got to hash this out.
#unknown Hey, what's more important than money? [door slams] [monitor beeping] These things they laughingly call pillows, I would not give them to prison inmates.
#unknown You want me to go ask for another? No.
#unknown Just remind me to bring his from home.
#unknown They're not moving his legs enough.
#unknown [knock on door] [Gomez] Hey, everybody.
#unknown Oh Hi, Marie.
#unknown Is it okay if if I visit? Yeah.
#unknown His color looks good.
#unknown [whispering] Gomie, is that you? Hey, buddy.
#unknown Yeah, it's me.
#unknown That's you, Gomie? Yeah, Hank.
#unknown I'm right here.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Closer.
#unknown What is it? Closer.
#unknown Asshole.
#unknown [laughs] Man, he got you good.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown I'm glad to see you still have your twisted sense of humor.
#unknown [chuckles] [coughs] Hey, check this out.
#unknown I got something that'll make you feel better.
#unknown I've been keeping an eye on that blue meth of yours.
#unknown Six, seven weeks, nothing.
#unknown Then all of a sudden, boom.
#unknown It's popping up everywhere.
#unknown Look at the new locations.
#unknown Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.
#unknown Even right here in town.
#unknown A teener here and there, you know, strictly streetlevel amounts.
#unknown Man, it's crazy.
#unknown How exactly is that supposed to make me feel better? Beuse you were right.
#unknown You're the only one that saw this coming.
#unknown Well, three cheers for me.
#unknown [beeps] [exhales] This thing doesn't do a damned thing.
#unknown Hank, it's probably still on lockout.
#unknown It's been an hour, right? I'm hurting here.
#unknown I could use some meds.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'll go find somebody.
#unknown Hey, no more shop talk.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown I didn't see it coming.
#unknown What? Damn right you did.
#unknown No, I didn't see shit.
#unknown Day late and a dollar short, as usual.
#unknown The only reason I'm even breathing is I got a warning call.
#unknown A warning call? What do you mean? One minute before they attacked me, somebody called my cell and told me to expect it.
#unknown A voice scrambler.
#unknown It could have been anybody.
#unknown Marie's got my phone somewhere, if you want to run the incoming.
#unknown Not that you're going to learn anything worth knowing.
#unknown I don't get it.
#unknown Cartel hit? Who would have called to warn you? I don't know.
#unknown [winces] Aw, Jesus.
#unknown Come on already.
#unknown [groans] Hang on.
#unknown Skyler, I had nothing to do Are we safe? Yes.
#unknown Are you safe? Absolutely.
#unknown Jesse? Jesse? What about you? Face looks better.
#unknown How's it all going? Anything you want to tell us about? What, like my interesting life? One day pretty much bleeds into the next.
#unknown Been working a lot.
#unknown I got a job.
#unknown [Group Leader] Job is good.
#unknown It's in a Laundromat.
#unknown It's totally corporate.
#unknown Corporate Laundromat.
#unknown [Jesse] It's, like, rigid.
#unknown All kinds of red tape.
#unknown My boss is a dick.
#unknown The owner? Super dick.
#unknown I'm not worthy or whatever to meet him, but I guess everybody's scared of the dude.
#unknown The place is full of deadeyed douchebags, the hours suck, and nobody knows what's going on, so Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Totally Kafkaesque.
#unknown Majorly.
#unknown Ooh, from the U.
#unknown S.
#unknown attorney in Santa Fe.
#unknown Very nice.
#unknown We've got all these nice tulips and baby's breath.
#unknown This is chrysanthemum.
#unknown That looks like chrysanthemum.
#unknown Look at these Hank.
#unknown Aren't they beautiful? Beautiful.
#unknown Wow, look at the size of this basket.
#unknown It's got so many goodies in it.
#unknown Look, chocolatecovered pretzels and cheese sticks and some some fancy designer olives.
#unknown You had me at cheese sticks.
#unknown Mmm, you're going to have to fight me for those, Hank.
#unknown "Get well, and best wishes from Ted Beneke and all the folks at Beneke Fabricators.
#unknown " Wow, he gives you all this time off, and now this? Get me a job there.
#unknown I know.
#unknown He's great.
#unknown Boss hall of fame.
#unknown I don't see anything here from Kleinman.
#unknown They're going to have to get on the stick.
#unknown [knocking on door] How's everybody doing today? Good.
#unknown We're good.
#unknown How are you? I'm very good.
#unknown Hi, Hank.
#unknown Just going to do a quick peripheral response, all right? See where we're at.
#unknown Moment of truth, huh? [chuckles] Yeah.
#unknown I wouldn't call it that.
#unknown All right, let's just take a look here.
#unknown All right.
#unknown All right, I want you to tell me if you can feel this.
#unknown All right.
#unknown How about this? Okay.
#unknown How about now? Do that one again, would you? Right there? Yeah, yeah, I feel it.
#unknown A tingle.
#unknown Okay, on a scale of one to ten, ten being your normal level of feeling and one bein no feeling at all.
#unknown Oh, I don't know.
#unknown A four? Okay, four.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown And how about there? Yeah.
#unknown Um, a six.
#unknown Okay, good.
#unknown And here? Yeah, still there.
#unknown A little less.
#unknown A three.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right, good.
#unknown Thank you very much, Hank.
#unknown Good, good.
#unknown So this is good news, right? Oh, yeah, definitely.
#unknown It looks like some nerve function is returning.
#unknown Oh, thank God.
#unknown All right, so when do we get him walking again? Marie, it's important that we manage our expectations.
#unknown We're talking about months of very hard work, and even then the odds, they're not great.
#unknown But you can't know for sure.
#unknown No.
#unknown When does he start physical therapy? We've sent the paperwork to your insurance.
#unknown It's high priority.
#unknown We should have preauthorization the next few days.
#unknown Certainly by early next week.
#unknown [Marie] Next week? No, that's not going to do it.
#unknown I've looked into this.
#unknown The sooner physical therapy begins, the better his chances are.
#unknown He needs daily sessions.
#unknown Isn't that right? Well Actually, your plan's treatment program covers four sessions a week.
#unknown Actually, she asked the doctor.
#unknown Planwise, four sessions a week is fairly typical.
#unknown And the therapists in your network are mostly fine.
#unknown Mostly fine? Okay.
#unknown There's a ringing endorsement.
#unknown Look, if Hank had more physical therapy, with better therapists, wouldn't it be more likely he would walk? It's very hard to say, Marie.
#unknown Is the health plan's way medically justifiable? Sure.
#unknown Is it absolutely optimal? Yo5 know, screw it.
#unknown I'm going to make sure he gets what he needs, and they can just reimburse me later.
#unknown Mrs.
#unknown Schrader, I get your frustration.
#unknown Really, I do.
#unknown But my best advice is stay in the network.
#unknown Don't go out of pocket.
#unknown Physical therapy is just the beginning.
#unknown We're talking nursing care, modifications to your home, occupational therapy, medical equipment.
#unknown It could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
#unknown So what? We're just supposed to compromise on his care? Well, if you don't follow the insurance company's procedures, they may never pay you back.
#unknown I've seen patients and their families go bankrupt, waiting to be reimbursed.
#unknown Who is the best physical therapist that you know? I can give you some names.
#unknown But they're not likely to be on your plan.
#unknown To hell with the plan.
#unknown [door chime dings] Yeah, there he is.
#unknown Finally.
#unknown I went ahead and started without you.
#unknown Ladies, this is Jessesan.
#unknown He's in for the full treatment.
#unknown Kick off your shoes.
#unknown Lay back.
#unknown Exfoliate.
#unknown Maybe later.
#unknown So, where's the maestro? Out parking the minivan? What do I look like, his shadow? Who cares where he's at? What am I doing here? Well, I was going to have you two flip a coin, but since the genius can't be bothered, today's your lucky day.
#unknown Look around, kiddo.
#unknown It's all yours.
#unknown What? This? Yeah.
#unknown You are now the owner of this fine establishment.
#unknown For free? Free? Ladies, cover your ears.
#unknown No, not free.
#unknown Look, hey, this is a squeakyclean, highly profitable at least potentially local institution, looked upon with favor by the Chamber of Commerce.
#unknown Better Business Bureau.
#unknown At $312,000, it's a steal.
#unknown Don't you get it? On the outside, it's a nail salon, right? On the inside, it's the best money laundry a growing boy could ask for.
#unknown Wait, wait.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Ladies, thank you.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Good job.
#unknown Come back here.
#unknown Sit.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Humor me here for a second.
#unknown Now, you know you need to launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it? Placement, layering, integration? I ain't buying no damn nail salon, so just forget it.
#unknown You want to stay out of jail, don't you? You want to keep your money and your freedom.
#unknown Because I got three little letters for you.
#unknown IRS.
#unknown If they can get Capone, they can get you.
#unknown Hey, look.
#unknown Here's you, right? Pink, Pinkman.
#unknown Get it? Okay, here's your cash.
#unknown You're out on the town.
#unknown You're partying hearty.
#unknown You're knocking boots with the chickie babes.
#unknown Oh, who's this? It's the tax man.
#unknown And he's looking at you.
#unknown What does he see? He sees a young fellow with a big, fancy house, unlimited cash supply, and no job.
#unknown Now what is the conclusion the tax man makes? I'm a drug dealer.
#unknown [imitates buzzer] Wrong.
#unknown Million times worse.
#unknown You're a tax cheat.
#unknown What do they do? They take every penny, and you go in the can for felony tax evasion.
#unknown Ouch.
#unknown What was your mistake? You didn't launder your money.
#unknown Now, you give me your money.
#unknown That's called placement.
#unknown Hand me that little thinGod bin.
#unknown This is the nail salon, right? I take your dirty money and I slip it into the salon's nice, clean cash flow.
#unknown That's called layering.
#unknown Final step, integration.
#unknown The revenues from the salon go to the owner.
#unknown That's you.
#unknown Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice, clean, taxable income, brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business.
#unknown So you want me to buy this place so I can pay taxes.
#unknown I'm a criminal, yo.
#unknown Yeah, and if you want to stay a criminal and not become, say, a convict, then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.
#unknown Right, so you can get your 5%.
#unknown No, that's 17%.
#unknown I heard you say 5.
#unknown You said it right in front of me.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That was for your partner.
#unknown It's privileges of seniority and all.
#unknown But for you, it's the usual.
#unknown Hey, what, you Hey, listen to Come on, I'm talking to you about your future here.
#unknown Listen to reason.
#unknown How is your brotherinlaw? He'll live.
#unknown Good.
#unknown I'm glad.
#unknown Walter, you seem troubled.
#unknown How can I help you? I asked to see you in order to clear the air.
#unknown There are some issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us, and I think it's in our best interest to lay the cards on the table.
#unknown That's the best way to do business.
#unknown My brotherinlaw, moments before he was attacked someone called to warn him.
#unknown I believe that same person was protecting me.
#unknown Those two men, the assassins I believe I was their prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brotherinlaw.
#unknown Because of this intervention, I am alive.
#unknown And yet I think that this person was playing a much deeper game.
#unknown He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout, not a silent assassination.
#unknown In one stroke he bloodied both sides, set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest.
#unknown If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border he would have the market to himself.
#unknown The rewards would be enormous.
#unknown We're both adults.
#unknown I can't pretend I don't know that person is you.
#unknown I want there to be no confusion.
#unknown I know I owe you my life.
#unknown And more than that, I respect the strategy.
#unknown In your position, I wouldn't done the same.
#unknown One issue which troubles me I don't know what happens when our threemonth contract ends.
#unknown What would you like to happen? You know why I do this.
#unknown I want security for my family.
#unknown Then you have it.
#unknown Three million for three month.
#unknown That was our agreement.
#unknown Extended annually, twelve million a year.
#unknown Call it fifteen.
#unknown Openended.
#unknown Would that be agreeable? [motor accelerating] [truck horn blares] [tires screeching] [gasps] [exhales] Part of the reason we talk about what gets us riled up, in our daily lives is to help each other put a finger on what our relapse triggers might be, head off our disease before it comes back.
#unknown So anyone? Free license to bitch and moan.
#unknown How often do you get that? Jesse, last time you seemed pretty down about your job at the Laundromat.
#unknown Let me ask you something.
#unknown If you had the chance to do anything you wanted, what would you do? Make more green, man, a lot more.
#unknown Forget about money.
#unknown Assume you have all you want.
#unknown Um I don't know.
#unknown I guess I would make something.
#unknown Like what? Not that it even matters, but work with my hands, I guess.
#unknown Building things, like carpentry or brick laying or something? I took this votech class in high school, wood working.
#unknown because it was just a big Jesus, but this one time I had this teacher name of, uh Mr.
#unknown Pike.
#unknown I guess he was, like, a Marine or something before he got old.
#unknown He was hard of hearing.
#unknown My project for his class was to make this wooden box, you know, like a small just like a like a box, you know, to put stuff in.
#unknown So I wanted to get the thing done just as fast as possible.
#unknown I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester, and he couldn't flunk me as long as I, you know, made the thing.
#unknown So I finished it in a couple days.
#unknown It looked pretty lame, but it worked, you know, for putting stuff in or whatnot.
#unknown So when I showed it to Mr.
#unknown Pike for my grade, he looked at it and said, "Is that the best you can do?" At first I thought to myself, "Hell, yeah, bitch.
#unknown "Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys.
#unknown " [group chuckles] I don't know.
#unknown Maybe it was the way he said it, but it was, like, he w he wasn't exactly saying it sucked.
#unknown He was just asking me honestly, "Is that all you got?" And for some reason I thought to myself, "Yeah, man, I can do better," so I started from scratch.
#unknown I made another, then another, and by the end of the semester, by, like, box number five, I had built this thing.
#unknown You should've seen it.
#unknown It was insane.
#unknown I mean, I built it out of Peruvian Walnut with inlaid Zebrawood.
#unknown It was fitted with pegs, no screws.
#unknown I sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass.
#unknown Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark.
#unknown It even smelled good.
#unknown You know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was It was perfect.
#unknown What happened to the box? I, um I gave it to my mom.
#unknown Nice.
#unknown You know what I'm going to say, don't you? It's never too late.
#unknown They have art coops that offer classes, adult extension program at the university.
#unknown You know, I didn't give the box to my mom.
#unknown I traded it for an ounce of weed.
#unknown He's a hero.
#unknown You don't deny coverage to a hero.
#unknown They'll say they're not denying coverage.
#unknown No, no, I'm agreeing with you, but I went through all this with Walt.
#unknown You'll burn through your savings, and then what? Well, you two managed, right? You said yourself that Elliot and Gretchen's money didn't cover everything.
#unknown [sighs] Jesus, I've got to get back.
#unknown What? No.
#unknown No, no, no, you should rest.
#unknown Look, why don't you go in and take a long bath I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
#unknown I want to be there in case he wakes up.
#unknown With all they're giving him, he'll sleep till morning.
#unknown [doorbell chimes] Hey, Sky.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Wha What are you doing here? Well, I just thought I'd stop by to see how you're holding up.
#unknown Is this a bad time, or Um Hi.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Uh, Marie, this is Ted, my boss.
#unknown Oh, you're Ted.
#unknown I've heard so much about you.
#unknown Thank you for your gift basket.
#unknown That was really thoughtful.
#unknown It was.
#unknown It was really nice.
#unknown Thank you, Ted.
#unknown Cheese sticks.
#unknown Cheese sticks.
#unknown Well, you're welcome.
#unknown You know, we care about Skyler so much that naturally that extends to the whole family.
#unknown Are you coming in? Oh, yeah, you should.
#unknown [chuckles] I'm sorry.
#unknown Come on in, Ted.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown [clears throat] We were just having some wine.
#unknown Would you like a glass? No.
#unknown No, thanks.
#unknown I'm just on my way home.
#unknown I just thought I'd You know, I I am really beat.
#unknown I think I'm going to take that bath.
#unknown It was nice to meet you, Ted, and thank you again.
#unknown Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
#unknown Please give my best wishes to your husband.
#unknown I will.
#unknown Thanks for stopping by, but it's actually not a not the best time for a visit, so Can we just talk for a minute? I know you need to be with your family, but I haven't heard from you in days I left messages I'm so sorry.
#unknown You gave me all that time off, and I really should've That's not my point.
#unknown I I care about you.
#unknown That's all.
#unknown Ted, I It's just this whole thing with Hank has been one nonstop horror show, you know, so Well, I I just want you to know that I'm here for you.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Um, but I really do need you to Okay.

#unknown You're divorced.
#unknown So what? Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted, okay? Is there some reasonfor sec? Because Later.
#unknown Ted, not now.
#unknown Skyler, just tell me You really want to do this now? Are you really going to make me do this right now? [sighs] Wow.
#unknown Yeah, you're right.
#unknown I'm Bad idea to come here.
#unknown Ted, I'm I'll see you in a day or two.
#unknown Back at the office.
#unknown Take as much time as you want.
#unknown [Badger] I can't believe you had to crush the RV.
#unknown Must've been, like depressing.
#unknown [Skinny Pete] For real.
#unknown That's a stone loss.
#unknown [Jesse] No one misses it more than me.
#unknown Free to cook anytime, anywhere.
#unknown No quotas, no one to answer to.
#unknown What's the point of being an outlaw when you've got responsibilities? Darth Vader had responsibilities.
#unknown He was responsible for the Death Star.
#unknown True that.
#unknown Two of them bitches.
#unknown Just saying.
#unknown Devil's advocate.
#unknown I've got to pay taxes now? What the hell's up with that? That's messed up, yo.
#unknown That's Kafkaesque.
#unknown Church.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Let's kick it back into gear.
#unknown Let's start slinging again.
#unknown Booyah! Shh.
#unknown Let's dot.
#unknown Life's too short.
#unknown That's what I say.
#unknown Hell, yeah, bitches.
#unknown We don't need no RV.
#unknown Alls we need is a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles, Nah, nah, nah, no shake 'n bake.
#unknown Where's your selfrespect? Come on.
#unknown Yo, maybe it ain't top shelf, but we could at least move it.
#unknown Still kind of dry out there.
#unknown Let's It'll sell on the street.
#unknown Who says we sell on the street? Maybe I know a whole new market.
#unknown Maybe alls we need is the meth.
#unknown [exhales] [scale beeps] What's the yield? Hey.
#unknown The yield.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Uh 201.
#unknown 8.
#unknown [Group Leader] I see a couple new faces.
#unknown Anybody want to introduce themselves? Don't all speak at once.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown So my name's Brandon.
#unknown Okay, Brandon.
#unknown You want to tell us something about yourself? Well, why I'm here it's just one thing.
#unknown It's meth.
#unknown It's bad.
#unknown Thought I had it kicked a couple times, you know, but then Jesus.
#unknown This new version of it hit the streets and wow.
#unknown Not that blue stuff.
#unknown Oh, sorry, I didn't raise my hand.
#unknown No, go ahead.
#unknown This is what we do.
#unknown Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.
#unknown You had it, to Yeah, bro.
#unknown I wish I never even heard of it.
#unknown It was like lighting my whole head on fire.
#unknown [Badger] Yeah, stuff will burn you down.
#unknown Only reason I have a hope in hell is because it's long gone.
#unknown That's the shame of it.
#unknown Nah, come on, man.
#unknown Don't tell me that.
#unknown I hear it's back in town.
#unknown Stay strong, brother.
#unknown Stay strong.
#unknown It's gonna be okay.
#unknown [monitor beeping] [Marie] I swear to God, I'll do it.
#unknown I will go to the press.
#unknown I will go to 48 Hours.
#unknown I will go to Nightline.
#unknown I don't even know if there is a Nightline anymore.
#unknown It doesn't matter.
#unknown They will all take it, and they will run with it because he is a hero, and he is not going to be in a wheelchair at 43.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Marie, I know Skyler's already told you this, but if there's every anything that you need, anything at all It's good to have you here.
#unknown Both of you.
#unknown I just wish there was something more that we could do.
#unknown Walt? We can always pay their bills.
#unknown [Marie] Please, it's tens of thousands of dollars.
#unknown We have the money, more than enough.
#unknown Walt earned it.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown I think Marie should know the truth.
#unknown Skyler, I really don't think this is a good idea.
#unknown I think that He earned it gambling.
#unknown Walt and I, uh We've had our problems lately.
#unknown You know that.
#unknown And, uh what it all came down to really was money.
#unknown Pure and simple.
#unknown When Walt was diagnosed, it, um It changed him.
#unknown Looking back, I don't think I ever really understood what it was that he was going through.
#unknown It was more than facing death.
#unknown It was knowing that he was going to leave behind nothing.
#unknown And so that's how this all started.
#unknown For better or worse, he wanted to provide, and so he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how.
#unknown I thought that Elliot and Gretchen paid for your treatment.
#unknown Yeah, I thought so, too, but the truth is he never took their money, not a dime.
#unknown He was too proud to take what he considered to be charity.
#unknown Isn't that right? So he put his mindo it and Well, you know how Walt is.
#unknown He's He's a problem solver, and he read books, and he did a whole bunch of research, and he came up with this system.
#unknown A system? A system for counting cards in Blackjack.
#unknown WWhat do you mean, like Rain Man? Well, I don't pretend to understand, you know, all the details, but he was convinced that if you put enough money into it, he'd have a, um, uh God, what is it? A statistical edge? Yes, statistical So right.
#unknown um, yeah.
#unknown So he Every spare minute, Walt was at some card table somewhere, and at first he went to the casinos, but then he realized that [low] but then he realized that the casinos report your winnings to the IRS, and if it gets reported, your family might find out, and if you do not want your family to find out, then you find another place to gamble, like an illegal, backroom game.
#unknown You remember all those long walks that Walt used to take, all that time he used to spend away from home? I guess for a couple months there you were sort of leading a double life, weren't you? Oh, my God.
#unknown Oh, my God, your your fugue state, was that some sort of cover? No.
#unknown No.
#unknown He did not fake that, Marie.
