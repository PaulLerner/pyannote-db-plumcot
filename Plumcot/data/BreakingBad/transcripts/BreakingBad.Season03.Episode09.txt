marie_schrader  Good.
marie_schrader  We're good.
marie_schrader  How are you? I'm
doctor_#1  I'm very good.
doctor_#1  Hi, Hank.
doctor_#1  Just going to do a quick peripheral response, all right?
doctor_#1  See where we're at.
hank_schrader  Moment of truth,
doctor_#1  I wouldn't call it that.
doctor_#1  All right, let's just take a look here.
doctor_#1  right. All
doctor_#1  I want you to tell me if you can feel this.
doctor_#1  How
doctor_#1  How about
doctor_#1  about now?
hank_schrader  one again,
hank_schrader  Right there? Yeah, yeah,
doctor_#1  Okay, on a scale of one to ten, ten being your normal level of feeling and one bein no feeling at all. Oh, I don't
hank_schrader  know.
hank_schrader  Okay,
doctor_#1  Okay.
doctor_#1  And
doctor_#1  And how about there? Yeah
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  Okay
doctor_#1  Okay, good. And
doctor_#1  And here?
hank_schrader  Yeah, still there.
hank_schrader  A little less.
hank_schrader  Okay.
doctor_#1  All right, good.
doctor_#1  Thank you very much, Hank.
doctor_#1  Good,
marie_schrader  good. So this is good news,
doctor_#1  Oh, yeah, definitely.
skyler_white  It
doctor_#1  It looks like some nerve function is returning.
skyler_white  Oh, thank God
marie_schrader  All right, so when do we get him walking again?
doctor_#1  Marie, it's important that we manage our expectations.
doctor_#1  We're talking about months of very hard work,
doctor_#1  and even then the odds, they're not great.
marie_schrader  But you can't know for sure.
doctor_#1  No.
skyler_white  When does he start physical therapy?
hospital_administrator  We've sent the paperwork to your insurance.
hospital_administrator  It's high priority.
hospital_administrator  We should have preauthorization the next few days.
hospital_administrator  Certainly by early next week.
marie_schrader  Next week?
marie_schrader  No, that's not going to do it.
marie_schrader  I've looked into this.
marie_schrader  The sooner physical therapy begins, the better his chances are.
marie_schrader  He needs daily sessions. Isn't
marie_schrader  Isn't that right?
doctor_#1  Well Actually
hospital_administrator  Actually, your plan's treatment program covers four sessions a week.
skyler_white  Actually, she asked the doctor.
doctor_#1  Planwise, four sessions a week is fairly typical.
doctor_#1  And the therapists in your network are mostly fine.
marie_schrader  Mostly fine?
marie_schrader  Okay. There's a ringing endorsement.
marie_schrader  Look, if Hank had more physical therapy, with better therapists, wouldn't it be more likely he would walk?
doctor_#1  It's very hard to say, Marie.
doctor_#1  Is the health plan's way medically justifiable?
doctor_#1  Sure.
doctor_#1  Is it absolutely optimal?
marie_schrader  Yo5 know, screw it.
marie_schrader  going to make sure he gets what he needs, and
marie_schrader  and they can just reimburse me later.
hospital_administrator  Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
hospital_administrator  Really, I do.
hospital_administrator  But my best advice is stay in the network. Don't
hospital_administrator  Don't go out of pocket.
hospital_administrator  Physical therapy is just the beginning.
hospital_administrator  We're talking nursing care, modifications to your home, occupational therapy, medical equipment. It
hospital_administrator  It could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
skyler_white  So what
skyler_white  We're just supposed to compromise on his care?
hospital_administrator  if you don't follow the insurance company's procedures, they may never pay you back.
hospital_administrator  I've seen patients and their families go bankrupt, waiting to be reimbursed.
marie_schrader  Who is the best physical therapist that you
doctor_#1  I can give you some names.
doctor_#1  But they're not likely to be on your plan
saul_goodman  plan. door chime dings Yeah, there he is.

saul_goodman  And he's looking at you.
saul_goodman  What does he see?
saul_goodman  He sees a young fellow with a big, fancy house, unlimited cash supply, and no job.
saul_goodman  Now what is the conclusion the tax man makes?
jesse_pinkman  I'm a drug dealer.
saul_goodman  Wrong. Million
saul_goodman  Million times worse.
saul_goodman  You're a tax cheat.
saul_goodman  What do they do?
saul_goodman  They take every penny, and you go in the can for felony tax evasion.
saul_goodman  What was your mistake?
saul_goodman  You didn't launder your money.
saul_goodman  Now, you give me your money. That's
saul_goodman  That's called placement.

saul_goodman  No, that's 17%.
jesse_pinkman  I heard you say 5.
jesse_pinkman  You said it right in front of me

gustavo_fring  How is your brotherinlaw?
walter_white  He'll live.
gustavo_fring  Walter, you seem troubled
walter_white  I asked to see you in order to clear the air.
walter_white  are some issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us, and I think it's in our best interest to lay the cards on the table.
gustavo_fring  That's the best way to do business.
walter_white  My brotherinlaw, moments before he was attacked someone called to warn him.
walter_white  I believe that same person was protecting me.
walter_white  Those two men, the assassins I believe I was their prime target,
walter_white  but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brotherinlaw.
walter_white  Because of this intervention, I am alive.
walter_white  And yet I think that this person was playing a much deeper game.
walter_white  He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout, not a silent assassination.
walter_white  In one stroke he bloodied both sides, set the American and Mexican governments against the cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the Southwest.
walter_white  If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border he would have the market to himself.
walter_white  The rewards would be enormous.
walter_white  We're both adults.
walter_white  I can't pretend I don't know that person is you.
walter_white  I want there to be no confusion.
walter_white  I know I owe you my life.
walter_white  And more than that, I respect the strategy.
walter_white  In your position, I wouldn't done the same.
walter_white  One issue which troubles me I don't know what happens when our threemonth contract ends.
gustavo_fring  What would you like to
walter_white  You know why I do this.
walter_white  I want security for my family.
walter_white  have it
gustavo_fring  Three million for three month.
gustavo_fring  That was our agreement.
gustavo_fring  Extended annually, twelve million a year.
gustavo_fring  Call it fifteen
gustavo_fring  Openended.
gustavo_fring  Would that be agreeable?
group_leader  blares tires screeching gasps exhales Part of the reason we talk about what gets us riled up, in our daily lives is to help each other put a finger on what our relapse triggers might be, head off our disease before it comes back.
group_leader  So anyone?
group_leader  Free license to bitch and moan.
group_leader  How often do you get that?
group_leader  Jesse, last time you seemed pretty down about your job at the Laundromat.
group_leader  Let me ask you something.
group_leader  If you had the chance to do anything you wanted, what would you do?
jesse_pinkman  more green, man,
jesse_pinkman  lot more.
group_leader  Forget about money.
group_leader  Assume you have all you want.
jesse_pinkman  I don't know.
jesse_pinkman  I guess I would make something.
group_leader  Like what?
jesse_pinkman  it even matters, but work with my hands, I guess.
group_leader  Building things, like carpentry or brick laying or something?
jesse_pinkman  I took this votech class in high school, wood working.
jesse_pinkman  because it was just a big Jesus, but
jesse_pinkman  but this one time I had this teacher name of, uh Mr.
jesse_pinkman  Pike. I guess he was, like, a Marine or something before he got old.
jesse_pinkman  He was hard of hearing.
jesse_pinkman  My project for his class was to make this wooden box,
jesse_pinkman  you know, like a small
jesse_pinkman  just like a like a box, you know, to put stuff in
jesse_pinkman  So I wanted to get the thing done just as fast as possible.
jesse_pinkman  I figured I could cut classes for the rest of the semester, and he couldn't flunk me as long as I, you know, made the thing.
jesse_pinkman  So I finished it in a couple days.
jesse_pinkman  looked pretty lame, but it worked, you know, for putting stuff in or whatnot.
jesse_pinkman  So when I showed it to Mr. Pike for my grade, he looked at it and said,
Jesse_Pinkman  Is that the best you can do?
jesse_pinkman  first I thought to myself," Hell, yeah, bitch.
Jesse_Pinkman  Now give me a D and shut up so I can go blaze one with my boys.
jesse_pinkman  I don't know.
jesse_pinkman  Maybe it was the way he said it, but it was
jesse_pinkman  w he wasn't exactly saying it sucked.
Jesse_Pinkman  He was just asking me honestly," Is that all you got?
jesse_pinkman  some reason I thought to myself,
Jesse_Pinkman  Yeah, man, I can do better," so I started from scratch.
jesse_pinkman  I made another, then another,
jesse_pinkman  by the end of the semester, by, like, box number five, I had built this thing.
jesse_pinkman  should've seen it.
jesse_pinkman  It was insane.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, I built it out of Peruvian Walnut with inlaid Zebrawood.
jesse_pinkman  was fitted with pegs, no screws.
jesse_pinkman  I sanded it for days until it was smooth as glass.
jesse_pinkman  Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil so it was rich and dark.
jesse_pinkman  even smelled good.
jesse_pinkman  You know, you put nose in it and breathed in, it was It
jesse_pinkman  was perfect.
group_leader  What happened to the box?
jesse_pinkman  I, um I gave it to my mom.
group_leader  Nice.
group_leader  You know what I'm going to say, don't you
group_leader  never too late.
group_leader  They have art coops that offer classes, adult extension program at the university.
jesse_pinkman  You know, I didn't give the box to my mom.
jesse_pinkman  I traded it for an ounce of weed.
marie_schrader  He's a hero.
marie_schrader  You don't deny coverage to a hero.
skyler_white  They'll say they're not denying coverage.
skyler_white  No, no, I'm agreeing with you,
skyler_white  but I went through all this with Walt.
skyler_white  You'll burn through your savings, and then what?
marie_schrader  Well, you two managed, right?
marie_schrader  You said yourself that Elliot and Gretchen's money didn't cover everything.
marie_schrader  Jesus, I've got to get back. What?
skyler_white  No
skyler_white  No.
skyler_white  No, no, no, you should rest.
skyler_white  Look, why don't you go in and take a long bath I
skyler_white  I put some fresh sheets on the bed
marie_schrader  I want to be there in case he wakes up.
skyler_white  With all they're giving him, he'll sleep till morning.

marie_schrader  I don't even know if there is a Nightline anymore. It
marie_schrader  It doesn't matter.
marie_schrader  They will all take it, and they will run with it because he is a hero, and he is not going to be in a wheelchair at 43.
walter_white  Marie
walter_white  I know Skyler's already told you this, but if there's every anything that you need, anything at all It's
marie_schrader  have you here
marie_schrader  Both of
walter_white  just wish there was something more that we could do. Walt? We can always
marie_schrader  Please, it's tens of thousands of dollars. We
skyler_white  We have the money, more than enough.
skyler_white  Walt earned it.
walter_white  Skyler
skyler_white  I think Marie should know the truth.
walter_white  Skyler, I really don't think this is a good idea.
walter_white  I think that He
skyler_white  He earned it gambling.
skyler_white  Walt and I, uh We've had our problems lately.
skyler_white  You know that
skyler_white  And, uh what it all came down to really was money.
skyler_white  Pure and simple.
skyler_white  When Walt was diagnosed, it, um It changed him.
skyler_white  Looking back, I don't think I ever really understood what it was that he was going through.
skyler_white  It was more than facing death. It
skyler_white  It was knowing that he was going to leave behind nothing.
skyler_white  And so that's how this all started.
skyler_white  For better or worse, he wanted to provide,
skyler_white  and so he paid his medical bills the only way he knew how.
marie_schrader  thought that Elliot and Gretchen paid for your treatment.
skyler_white  Yeah, I thought so, too
skyler_white  the truth is he never took their money,
skyler_white  not a dime
skyler_white  He was too proud to take what he considered to be charity.
skyler_white  So he put his mindo it and
skyler_white  you know how Walt is. He's
skyler_white  He's He's a problem solver,
skyler_white  and he read books, and he did a whole bunch of research, and he came up with this system. A system?
marie_schrader  A
skyler_white  A system for counting cards in Blackjack.
marie_schrader  WWhat do you mean, like Rain Man?
skyler_white  Well, I don't pretend to understand, you know, all the details, but he was convinced that if you put enough money into it, he'd have a, um,
skyler_white  what is it? A
skyler_white  A statistical edge?
walter_white  Yes, statistical So right.
skyler_white  um,
skyler_white  So he Every spare minute, Walt was at some card table somewhere,
skyler_white  and at first he went to the casinos, but then he realized that
skyler_white  he realized that the casinos report your winnings to the IRS,
skyler_white  and if it gets reported, your family might find out,
skyler_white  and if you do not want your family to find out, then you find another place to gamble,
skyler_white  like an illegal, backroom game.
skyler_white  You remember all those long walks that Walt used to take, all that time he used to spend away from home?
skyler_white  guess for a couple months there you were sort of leading a double life, weren't you
marie_schrader  Oh, my God.
marie_schrader  my God, your your fugue state,
marie_schrader  was that some sort of cover?
skyler_white  No. No. He
skyler_white  He did not fake that, Marie.
skyler_white  The night that Walt disappeared he los$14,000.
skyler_white  It was his pension fund, our savings, basically every last dime we had to our name, gone.
skyler_white  He couldn't live with it.
skyler_white  He was suicidal.
skyler_white  to try to understand that as soon as he got out of the hospital, he went right back to gambling.
skyler_white  I mean, that's how deep this went.
marie_schrader  How could you do that to her
skyler_white  Anyway, this system of his he
skyler_white  So all
skyler_white  say we have the money.
skyler_white  No more gambling.
skyler_white  have the money. How much money?
marie_schrader  Walt
walter_white  It's in the seven figures.
marie_schrader  Holy Mary, Mother of God
walter_white  What can
walter_white  I did very well.
skyler_white  Marie you will take our money.
skyler_white  Use it to take care of Hank.
walter_white  Marie, let us help.
marie_schrader  about this? Absolutely not
skyler_white  not, and I need to
skyler_white  th way, and Hank
skyler_white  got enough on his
skyler_white  mind right now, so can
skyler_white  we just please keep
marie_schrader  keep this between us?
marie_schrader  Yeah. Yeah, I Yeah, I I just I need to Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later. How did you come up with that? I mean, where where did you possibly I learned from the best.
walter_white  Somehow something tells me that
skyler_white  because of you.
skyler_white  I'm not forgetting that
