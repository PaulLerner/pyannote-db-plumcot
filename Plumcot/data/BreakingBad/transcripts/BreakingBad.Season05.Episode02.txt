Walter_White  There's a market to be filled, and currently no one to fill it.
jesse_pinkman  of money to be made And

walter_white  With your experience and connections, you would be a great help.
walter_white  Granted, there's a lot of work ahead.
walter_white  a lot of rebuilding.

hank_schrader  Thanks
hank_schrader  Thanks.
herzog  I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.
herzog  Almost singlehandedly, he grew up a little restaurant division into an industry leader and a source of great personal pride.
herzog  I am shocked and saddened by his death and outraged by the damage his actions have brought upon my grandfather's company.
lawyer_(madrigal)  Alleged actions.
herzog  An innocent man does not kill himself.
herzog  My people and I are here to help.
herzog  your investigation I pledge Madrigal's full cooperation and transparency.
herzog  confess I have my selfish reasons.
herzog  I believe Peter Schuler was a lone anomaly.
herzog  But if that is not the case, I want to know it, just as you do.
hank_schrader  when you gonna announce it
george_merkert  I don't know.
george_merkert  As I'm walking out the door with my big cardboard box.
hank_schrader  can't do that.
hank_schrader  know damn well we're gonna throw you a big party.
steven_gomez  Damn straight.
steven_gomez  We're talking a blowout.
george_merkert  Outstanding police work, Hank.
george_merkert  only I'd listened.
george_merkert  But I guess the damage was done.
hank_schrader  It's not right, them putting this on you.
george_merkert  Somebody's gonna go under the bus.
george_merkert  Ramey's a good man.
george_merkert  He'll do right by you
george_merkert  Besides, this office practically runs itself.
hank_schrader  Bullshit it does.
george_merkert  What's with that APD thing?
george_merkert  The electromagnets?
steven_gomez  They're thinking it's about Fring's laptop.
steven_gomez  Turns out a couple of days before it happened, desk sergeant gets this phone call from a" postal inspector" Quote, unquote Wanting to know where they keep the thing.
george_merkert  And he told them
george_merkert  Jesus.
george_merkert  Anything left of the laptop?
hank_schrader  we look that lucky?
hank_schrader  You know, I sneaked a peek before APD took it out of Fring's office.
hank_schrader  The whole thing was encrypted.
hank_schrader  They wouldn't have got anything anyway, but
george_merkert  So Hector Salamanca killed Fring.
george_merkert  who gave Salamanca the bomb?
hank_schrader  Whole lot of questions and not much in the way of answers.
hank_schrader  Yet.
steven_gomez  The APD did find some of Fring's financials.
steven_gomez  That just might lead to something.
george_merkert  I had him out to my house
george_merkert  Fourth of July.
george_merkert  cooked out in the backyard.
george_merkert  My son shucked the corn.
george_merkert  My daughter cut up potatoes.
george_merkert  Fring brought sea bass.
george_merkert  Every time I grill it now, I make a little foil pouch, just like he showed me.
george_merkert  whole night, we were laughing, telling stories, drinking wine.
george_merkert  And he's somebody else completely.
george_merkert  Right in front of
george_merkert  Right under my nose.
fran  can I
fran  you? Just
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Just tea, please.

fran  we don't have chamomile tea.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Then some sort of bergamot, provided it's not Earl Grey.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I like soy milk instead of dairy.

lydia_rodarte-quayle  Wow. You're really running me through my paces here.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Well, English breakfast, I guess.
fran  We have Lipton's

lydia_rodarte-quayle  So
fran  weird. Chuckles You want anything else, Mike?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm good, Fran.
mike_ehrmantraut  How about we lose the sunglasses?
mike_ehrmantraut  I feel like I'm talking to Jackie Onassis here.
mike_ehrmantraut  There you go.
mike_ehrmantraut  Breathe in, breathe out.
mike_ehrmantraut  Drink your whatever.
mike_ehrmantraut  killed Gus? Haven't I told you not to worry about that?
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, what do you want from me, and why is it so important?
mike_ehrmantraut  of 11
lydia_rodarte-quayle  names.
mike_ehrmantraut  Okay.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  You know them
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Those 11 men and I think you know this, Mike.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Those 11 could sink us, you and me both.
mike_ehrmantraut  Where are we going with this, Lydia?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  No specific.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I'm just pointing out facts.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  These men your men yours and Gus's these men were on the payroll, very publicly.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  They trace back to Pollos and the laundry. They trace back to Madrigal,
lydia_rodarte-quayle  and they're gonna get picked up by the police.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  And when they do, when they get picked up and threatened with prosecution, and there's only one way out for
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I'm not saying all of them. Okay?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  All it's gonna take is two or three, or even one. But there's
lydia_rodarte-quayle  there's always a weak link somewhere
lydia_rodarte-quayle  But they're gonna talk.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  At least one of them's gonna talk about you, about me, and that's all it's gonna take.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  These are the 11 I know of, but I'd love your input.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I never met your chemist, for instance. I'd
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I'd love your input.
mike_ehrmantraut  You want me to kill every man on that list? Wow
lydia_rodarte-quayle  That's a leap, what you
lydia_rodarte-quayle  No, I didn't say that.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  But if you think that'd be wise
mike_ehrmantraut  scared, aren't you
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Yeah.
mike_ehrmantraut  You're very upset, which I'm gonna factor into my response here.
mike_ehrmantraut  These are my guys, and they are solid.
mike_ehrmantraut  Understand?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  What about Chow at the warehouse?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Didn't one time you have to shoot him through the hand?
mike_ehrmantraut  You think that didn't stick in his memory?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  What about Dennis at the laundry? They're
lydia_rodarte-quayle  They're sure to pick him
mike_ehrmantraut  him up
mike_ehrmantraut  up. They already have. They picked him up last night.
mike_ehrmantraut  My guys are solid.
mike_ehrmantraut  I vetted them with great care, and Fring made sure they were well compensated in the event of a situation such as this.
mike_ehrmantraut  They're paid to stand up to the heat, keep their mouths shut, no matter what.
mike_ehrmantraut  And they will.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, I don't know what kind of movies you've been watching, but here in the real world, we don't kill 11 people as some kind of prophylactic measure.
mike_ehrmantraut  Look at me and say you understand. I understand.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I get
lydia_rodarte-quayle  So
mike_ehrmantraut  So we're off that very silly idea?

hank_schrader  I, is that right?
mike_ehrmantraut  Close enough
steven_gomez  So, once more, you're waiving your right to have an attorney present?
mike_ehrmantraut  Correct.
steven_gomez  Could you state that to the camera,
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm waiving my right to have an attorney present.
hank_schrader  Uh, okay, then.
hank_schrader  We just have a few questions.
hank_schrader  You're currently employed by the Pollos Hermanos chain.
hank_schrader  Is that correct?
mike_ehrmantraut  Yes, I am.
hank_schrader  And what do you do there?
mike_ehrmantraut  Corporate security.
hank_schrader  Corporate security?
hank_schrader  What's that?
hank_schrader  Like, uh, guarding the special sauce?
mike_ehrmantraut  I conduct employee background checks,
mike_ehrmantraut  I oversee loss prevention.
hank_schrader  At a fastfood restaurant, that's a fulltime job?
mike_ehrmantraut  We have 14 locations.
mike_ehrmantraut  So, yes, it's a fulltime job
hank_schrader  Yeah, well Chuckles If I were you, I'd start sending out those resumes.
hank_schrader  It says here you're a private investigator?
hank_schrader  Where you licensed?
mike_ehrmantraut  New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.
mike_ehrmantraut  Every state where we operate.
hank_schrader  Colorado? You
hank_schrader  You have some restaurants there, right?
mike_ehrmantraut  doesn't require licensure.
Hank_Schrader  You licensed to carry a firearm?
mike_ehrmantraut  Concealed carry?
mike_ehrmantraut  Yes, I am.
hank_schrader  Which states?
mike_ehrmantraut  It'd be quicker to mention the states in which I'm not.
hank_schrader  And if we pulled your CCP's, everything would be in order?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm guessing you've already done that, so you tell me.
hank_schrader  You strike me as a former cop.
hank_schrader  Am I right?
mike_ehrmantraut  Philadelphia.
hank_schrader  Philly.
hank_schrader  city of brotherly love.
hank_schrader  It turns out we, uh We know some folks there, and they told us that your tenure as a police officer ended somewhat, uh, dramatically?
hank_schrader  You wanna talk about that
mike_ehrmantraut  Not particularly.
hank_schrader  Yeah, me neither.
hank_schrader  See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring decided to put a guy like you in charge of his corporate security.
hank_schrader  I mean, given your history doing background checks on pimplefaced fry cooks.
hank_schrader  Seems like over
hank_schrader  What else you do for Fring?
hank_schrader  He must've needed help running that drug empire of his, no?
mike_ehrmantraut  Drug empire?
mike_ehrmantraut  First I'm hearing about that.
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't know anything about that.
steven_gomez  we have a guy that could put you in that underground lab, and he'll testify to it
steven_gomez  So from here on out, this can go hard or easy,
steven_gomez  what's it gonna be?
mike_ehrmantraut  Forget your handcuffs?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm confused. Am
mike_ehrmantraut  Am I under arrest here, or am I
mike_ehrmantraut  You wanna state that for the camera?
hank_schrader  You are not under arrest, currently.
mike_ehrmantraut  Agents, do you have any more questions for me?
mike_ehrmantraut  Because you've got me very stirred up with all these false accusations.
mike_ehrmantraut  If I'm not under arrest, I'd prefer to leave.
hank_schrader  Uhuh. And I suppose we could talk about the two million dollars in your granddaughter's name.
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  It seems, uh, Fring had all these secret offshore accounts that he would deposit money into Like
hank_schrader  Like, uh, well, an even dozen of them
hank_schrader  And they're all in the names of certain people on his payroll.
hank_schrader  was the, uh The manager of the laundry, um, a couple guys from the Pollos distribution center.
hank_schrader  There was the owner of a chemical warehouse, a bunch of others.
hank_schrader  You know, guys that must've been getting paid off the books.
hank_schrader  Anyway, one of the names was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
hank_schrader  Ten years old and just cute as a button.
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  Two million and change we found on deposit for her.
hank_schrader  Way more than anybody else.
hank_schrader  Now, my partner here, he took one look at that and said,
hank_schrader " Shit, man.
Hank_Schrader  This fifthgrade girl is the muscle behind Fring's entire operation.
hank_schrader " I said," Whoa, whoa. Hey, partner, slow down there.
Hank_Schrader  Maybe it was actually her dear old granddaddy.
hank_schrader  Impressive, no? But Clicks tongue
hank_schrader  tongue Level of insight?
hank_schrader  He's not impressed, Gomie.
steven_gomez  Perhaps he's picturing all that money going byebye.
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, I mean, the government's gonna take every last dollar, unless
hank_schrader  Well, here's the thing, Mike or Michael? Mr.
mike_ehrmantraut  Ehrmantraut. Here's
hank_schrader  Here's the thing, Mike.
hank_schrader  Lucky for you, you didn't touch that money.
hank_schrader  cannot say the same for the other 11 on the list.
steven_gomez  One of your guys is gonna roll on you, and then we'll definitely remember the handcuffs.
hank_schrader  Now, before that day comes, you can do yourself a solid.
hank_schrader  You can tell us what you know, you can tell us who's still out there, and if we like your story, good things can happen.
steven_gomez  Kaylee might be able to keep some of that money.
hank_schrader  Maybe.
hank_schrader  So what do you say?
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't know anything about any money.
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't know what you're talking about.
walter_white  First order of business is to find a new place to cook.
walter_white  Before anyone says it, no more RV's.
jesse_pinkman  I don't know.
jesse_pinkman  The crystal ship did pretty good for us.
walter_white  The" crystal ship"
jesse_pinkman  That's what I called it.
walter_white  Well, I'll admit it held us on as a starter lab, but it was too dark, too small, not to mention it could've broken down at any moment.
walter_white  Saul, find us someplace safe from prying eyes.
walter_white  Security against detection is paramount.
walter_white  But I don't wanna drive too far.
walter_white  No more 50mile treks to some Indian reservation.
saul_goodman  In town is trickier. I
saul_goodman  I mean, you got a lot more of your prying eyes.
walter_white  If Gus can manage it, then so can we.
walter_white  Precursor.
walter_white  Where are we with that?
jesse_pinkman  Uh, we're good on everything except, uh, methylamine.
jesse_pinkman  No surprise.
jesse_pinkman  just dry as hell out there.
jesse_pinkman  What if we switched back to a pseudo cook?
walter_white  Absolutely out of the question.
walter_white  Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
walter_white  I know it
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, but what if there's not?
jesse_pinkman  Because there isn't.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, really.
walter_white  There is.
walter_white  Have faith.
saul_goodman  I Can I offer a thought?
saul_goodman  Say a guy wins the lottery.
saul_goodman  Ten million bucks.
saul_goodman  The very next day, what's the one thing he does not do?
saul_goodman  He does not go buy another lottery ticket, right? He
saul_goodman  He counts his lucky stars, and he sails off into the sunset, which, seems to me, and all due respect, some advice you two might take.
walter_white  What lottery did I win exactly?
saul_goodman  Hey, you're alive.
saul_goodman  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's the Irish sweepstakes.
walter_white  I'm alive, and I'm broke.
walter_white  Counting the money that I owe Jesse, I'm about 40 grand in the hole.
walter_white  Does that seem like an acceptable stopping point to you?
walter_white  There is gold in the streets, just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up.
walter_white  But, me? I should quit now.
walter_white  Jesse, too, I suppose, huh? Wow.
mike_ehrmantraut  I got you this time,
mike_ehrmantraut  And how come you get two, and I only get one?
mike_ehrmantraut  no, you don't
mike_ehrmantraut  don't.
