#unknown Well, look.
#unknown You had the pack in your pocket of your jacket, right?  Yeah.

#unknown Look, it's not in my house.
#unknown It's not in my car.
#unknown And the more I think about it, there's no way it fell out in my locker.
#unknown And I keep thinking somebody's gonna find this thing  on the street or something.
#unknown You don't know that.
#unknown Somewhere where I dropped it.
#unknown No.
#unknown Some innocent person, some kid maybe, even.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.

#unknown We're here to talk partnership.
#unknown Partnership.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Equal.
#unknown Three ways You, Jesse and me.
#unknown Well, we figure we're gonna start cooking again.
#unknown You know, we figure, why not? There's no denying the popularity of our product.
#unknown There's a market to be filled,  and currently no one to fill it.
#unknown A lot of money to be made And obviously, Jesse and I have manufacture covered.
#unknown But there's still distribution, support, logistics, that sort of thing.
#unknown For instance, we'll need a steady supply of precursor.
#unknown With your experience and connections, you would be a great help.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown Granted, there's a lot of work ahead.
#unknown There's a lot of rebuilding.
#unknown And, no doubt, our profits will be smaller.
#unknown At least at first.
#unknown But each of us will receive a larger cut.
#unknown Owners, not employees.
#unknown Thanks, but no, thanks.
#unknown Mike, I know you don't care for me.
#unknown We've had our issues, you and I.
#unknown I would suggest that you leave emotion out of this decision.
#unknown I am.
#unknown You are trouble.
#unknown I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it, but I sure ash hell do.
#unknown You are a time bomb tick, tick, ticking, and I have no intention of being around for the boom.
#unknown Well, sleep on it.
#unknown Maybe you'll reconsider.
#unknown In the meantime, we're pressing on.
#unknown Morning.
#unknown Hey, why aren't you upstairs?  I came to see if you needed any help.
#unknown Yeah, well, I don't.
#unknown Well, I can see that, man.
#unknown It's outstanding.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm working on it here.
#unknown Not exactly running marathons here, you know.
#unknown Yeah, well, when did your couchshaped ass ever run any marathons?  I'm proud of you, brother.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown So how many cars we've got? Enough to invade Poland.
#unknown Came in their own G5, just like Oprah has.
#unknown G5, yeah?  Mmhmm.
#unknown Is that one where the Where the wings go up like that?  I think they all do that.
#unknown They all have that? Anyway, we got two U.
#unknown S.
#unknown attorneys in the house.
#unknown Big doings.
#unknown Your name keeps coming up.
#unknown Yeah? Hey, give me a hand here, would you? Just just a little bit there.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown [Herzog] I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.
#unknown Almost singlehandedly, he grew up a little restaurant division into an industry leader and a source of great personal pride.
#unknown I am shocked and saddened by his death and outraged by the damage his actions have brought upon my grandfather's company.
#unknown [Speaks german] Alleged actions.
#unknown An innocent man does not kill himself.
#unknown My people and I are here to help.
#unknown Through your investigation I pledge Madrigal's full cooperation and transparency.
#unknown I confess I have my selfish reasons.
#unknown I believe Peter Schuler was a lone anomaly.
#unknown But if that is not the case, I want to know it, just as you do.
#unknown So when you gonna announce it? I don't know.
#unknown As I'm walking out the door with my big cardboard box.
#unknown You can't do that.
#unknown You know damn well we're gonna throw you a big party.
#unknown Damn straight.
#unknown We're talking a blowout.
#unknown Outstanding police work, Hank.
#unknown If only I'd listened.
#unknown But I guess the damage was done.
#unknown It's not right, them putting this on you.
#unknown Somebody's gonna go under the bus.
#unknown Ramey's a good man.
#unknown He'll do right by you.
#unknown Besides, this office practically runs itself.
#unknown Bullshit it does.
#unknown Sir.
#unknown What's with that APD thing? The electromagnets? They're thinking it's about Fring's laptop.
#unknown Turns out a couple of days before it happened, desk sergeant gets this phone call from a "postal inspector" Quote, unquote Wanting to know where they keep the thing.
#unknown And he told them? Jesus.
#unknown Anything left of the laptop? [Scoffs] Do we look that lucky? You know, I sneaked a peek before APD took it out of Fring's office.
#unknown The whole thing was encrypted.
#unknown They wouldn't have got anything anyway, but So Hector Salamanca killed Fring.
#unknown But who gave Salamanca the bomb? Whole lot of questions and not much in the way of answers.
#unknown Yet.
#unknown The APD did find some of Fring's financials.
#unknown That just might lead to something.
#unknown I had him out to my house.
#unknown Fourth of July.
#unknown We cooked out in the backyard.
#unknown My son shucked the corn.
#unknown My daughter cut up potatoes.
#unknown Fring brought sea bass.
#unknown Every time I grill it now, I make a little foil pouch, just like he showed me.
#unknown That whole night, we were laughing, telling stories, drinking wine.
#unknown And he's somebody else completely.
#unknown Right in front of me.
#unknown Right under my nose.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown What can I get you?  Just tea, please.
#unknown Chamomile.
#unknown Oh, sorry, we don't have chamomile tea.
#unknown Then some sort of bergamot, provided it's not Earl Grey.
#unknown I like soy milk instead of dairy.
#unknown We don't have soy milk or any sort of bergamot.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown You're really running me through my paces here.
#unknown Uhhuh.
#unknown Well, English breakfast, I guess.
#unknown We have Lipton's.
#unknown That's pretty much all we have.
#unknown I would like a cup of hot water, filtered, if possible, ad a single slice of lemon.
#unknown And I'm assuming you don't have stevia? Never mind.
#unknown I brought my own.
#unknown You coming to me, or am I coming to you? Face forward.
#unknown We'll talk like this.
#unknown I guess I'm coming to you.
#unknown Ohh.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown Take a breath, will you? This place is safe, no one's gonna see you here.
#unknown My God! Duane, this is so Thank you.
#unknown How did I not see you sitting back there? So weird.
#unknown [Chuckles] You want anything else, Mike? No.
#unknown I'm good, Fran.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown [Sighs] How about we lose the sunglasses? I feel like I'm talking to Jackie Onassis here.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown Breathe in, breathe out.
#unknown Drink your whatever.
#unknown Who killed Gus? Haven't I told you not to worry about that? Now, what do you want from me, and why is it so important? What's this? A list of 11 names.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown You know them all.
#unknown I do.
#unknown Those 11 men and I think you know this, Mike.
#unknown Those 11 could sink us, you and me both.
#unknown Where are we going with this, Lydia? No specific.
#unknown I'm just pointing out facts.
#unknown These men your men yours and Gus's these men were on the payroll, very publicly.
#unknown They trace back to Pollos and the laundry.
#unknown They trace back to Madrigal, and they're gonna get picked up by the police.
#unknown And when they do, when they get picked up and threatened with prosecution, and there's only one way out for them, they're gonna And I'm not saying all of them.
#unknown Okay? All it's gonna take is two or three, or even one.
#unknown But there's always a weak link somewhere.
#unknown But they're gonna talk.
#unknown At least one of them's gonna talk about you, about me, and that's all it's gonna take.
#unknown These are the 11 I know of, but I'd love your input.
#unknown I never met your chemist, for instance.
#unknown I'd love your input.
#unknown You want me to kill every man on that list? Wow.
#unknown That's a leap, what you just, uh No, I didn't say that.
#unknown But if you think that'd be wise [Sighs] You're scared, aren't you? Yeah.
#unknown You're very upset, which I'm gonna factor into my response here.
#unknown These are my guys, and they are solid.
#unknown Understand?  What about Chow at the warehouse? Didn't one time you have to shoot him through the hand? You think that didn't stick in his memory? What about Dennis at the laundry? They're sure to pick him up.
#unknown They already have.
#unknown They picked him up last night.
#unknown My guys are solid.
#unknown I vetted them with great care, and Fring made sure they were well compensated in the event of a situation such as this.
#unknown They're paid to stand up to the heat, keep their mouths shut, no matter what.
#unknown And they will.
#unknown Now, I don't know what kind of movies you've been watching, but here in the real world, we don't kill 11 people as some kind of prophylactic measure.
#unknown Look at me and say you understand.
#unknown I understand.
#unknown I get it.
#unknown So we're off that very silly idea? Good.
#unknown Drink your hot water.
#unknown I gotta go.
#unknown Have you had enough? Yeah.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown [Quietly] Byebye.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Bye, big brother.
#unknown [Chuckles] Say bye to mom for me.
#unknown I will.
#unknown Have a good day.
#unknown You, too.
#unknown [Door opens] [Sighs] [Door closes] [Quietly]  Skyler.
#unknown Mmm Hey.
#unknown The car wash opens in 15 minutes.
#unknown Mariano can open for me today.
#unknown Hey, how about you get up, huh? Come on.
#unknown A shower will feel good.
#unknown Hey, Chow.
#unknown How you holding up? Okay.
#unknown You know, they they They talked to me.
#unknown You can't smoke in here, Chow.
#unknown [Elevator bell dings] [Hank] Thanks for coming down.
#unknown Have a seat, Mr.
#unknown Ehrmantraut.
#unknown Am I, is that right? Close enough.
#unknown So, once more, you're waiving your right to have an attorney present? Correct.
#unknown Could you state that to the camera, please? I'm waiving my right to have an attorney present.
#unknown Uh, okay, then.
#unknown We just have a few questions.
#unknown You're currently employed by the Pollos Hermanos chain.
#unknown Is that correct?  Yes, I am.
#unknown And what do you do there?  Corporate security.
#unknown Corporate security?  Yeah.
#unknown What's that? Like, uh, guarding the special sauce? I conduct employee background checks, I oversee loss prevention.
#unknown At a fastfood restaurant, that's a fulltime job? We have 14 locations.
#unknown So, yes, it's a fulltime job.
#unknown Yeah, well [Chuckles] If I were you, I'd start sending out those resumes.
#unknown It says here you're a private investigator? Where you licensed? New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.
#unknown Every state where we operate.
#unknown Colorado? You have some restaurants there, right? Colorado doesn't require licensure.
#unknown You licensed to carry a firearm? Concealed carry? Yes, I am.
#unknown Which states? It'd be quicker to mention the states in which I'm not.
#unknown And if we pulled your CCP's, everything would be in order? I'm guessing you've already done that, so you tell me.
#unknown You strike me as a former cop.
#unknown Am I right? Where at? Philadelphia.
#unknown Philly.
#unknown [Chuckles] The city of brotherly love.
#unknown It turns out we, uh We know some folks there, and they told us that your tenure as a police officer ended somewhat, uh, dramatically? You wanna talk about that? Not particularly.
#unknown Yeah, me neither.
#unknown See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring decided to put a guy like you in charge of his corporate security.
#unknown I mean, given your history doing background checks on pimplefaced fry cooks.
#unknown Seems like over What else you do for Fring? He must've needed help running that drug empire of his, no? Drug empire? First I'm hearing about that.
#unknown I don't know anything about that.
#unknown Hey, man, we have a guy that could put you in that underground lab, and he'll testify to it.
#unknown So from here on out, this can go hard or easy, so what's it gonna be? Forget your handcuffs? I'm confused.
#unknown Am I under arrest here, or am I not? You wanna state that for the camera? You are not under arrest, currently.
#unknown Agents, do you have any more questions for me? Because you've got me very stirred up with all these false accusations.
#unknown If I'm not under arrest, I'd prefer to leave.
#unknown Uhuh.
#unknown And I suppose we could talk about the two million dollars in your granddaughter's name.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It seems, uh, Fring had all these secret offshore accounts that he would deposit money into Like, uh, well, an even dozen of them And they're all in the names of certain people on his payroll.
#unknown There was the, uh The manager of the laundry, um, a couple guys from the Pollos distribution center.
#unknown There was the owner of a chemical warehouse, a bunch of others.
#unknown You know, guys that must've been getting paid off the books.
#unknown Anyway, one of the names was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
#unknown Ten years old and just cute as a button.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Two million and change we found on deposit for her.
#unknown Way more than anybody else.
#unknown Now, my partner here, he took one look at that and said, "Shit, man.
#unknown This fifthgrade girl is the muscle behind Fring's entire operation.
#unknown " I said, "Whoa, whoa.
#unknown Hey, partner, slow down there.
#unknown Maybe it was actually her dear old granddaddy.
#unknown " Impressive, no? But [Clicks tongue] Level of insight? He's not impressed, Gomie.
#unknown Perhaps he's picturing all that money going byebye.
#unknown Yeah, well, I mean, the government's gonna take every last dollar, unless Well, here's the thing, Mike or Michael?  Mr.
#unknown Ehrmantraut.
#unknown Here's the thing, Mike.
#unknown Lucky for you, you didn't touch that money.
#unknown I cannot say the same for the other 11 on the list.
#unknown One of your guys is gonna roll on you, and then we'll definitely remember the handcuffs.
#unknown Now, before that day comes, you can do yourself a solid.
#unknown You can tell us what you know, you can tell us who's still out there, and if we like your story, good things can happen.
#unknown Kaylee might be able to keep some of that money.
#unknown Maybe.
#unknown So what do you say? I don't know anything about any money.
#unknown I don't know what you're talking about.
#unknown First order of business is to find a new place to cook.
#unknown Before anyone says it, no more RV's.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown The crystal ship did pretty good for us.
#unknown The "crystal ship"?  Yeah.
#unknown That's what I called it.
#unknown Well, I'll admit it held us on as a starter lab, but it was too dark, too small, not to mention it could've broken down at any moment.
#unknown Saul, find us someplace safe from prying eyes.
#unknown Security against detection is paramount.
#unknown But I don't wanna drive too far.
#unknown No more 50mile treks to some Indian reservation.
#unknown In town is trickier.
#unknown I mean, you got a lot more of your prying eyes.
#unknown If Gus can manage it, then so can we.
#unknown Precursor.
#unknown Where are we with that? Uh, we're good on everything except, uh, methylamine.
#unknown No surprise.
#unknown It's just dry as hell out there.
#unknown What if we switched back to a pseudo cook? Absolutely out of the question.
#unknown Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
#unknown I know it.
#unknown Yeah, but what if there's not? Because there isn't.
#unknown I mean, really.
#unknown There is.
#unknown Have faith.
#unknown Can I Can I offer a thought? Uh Say a guy wins the lottery.
#unknown Ten million bucks.
#unknown The very next day, what's the one thing he does not do? He does not go buy another lottery ticket, right? He counts his lucky stars, and he sails off into the sunset, which, seems to me, and all due respect, some advice you two might take.
#unknown What lottery did I win exactly? Hey, you're alive.
#unknown I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's the Irish sweepstakes.
#unknown I'm alive, and I'm broke.
#unknown Counting the money that I owe Jesse, I'm about 40 grand in the hole.
#unknown Does that seem like an acceptable stopping point to you? There is gold in the streets, just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up.
#unknown But, me? I should quit now.
#unknown Jesse, too, I suppose, huh? Wow.
#unknown I got you this time, kid.
#unknown And how come you get two, and I only get one? Hmm? Oh, no, you don't.
#unknown That one's mine! [Mutters] No.
#unknown Aaahhh! [Phone buzzing] [Mutters] Oh.
#unknown [Buzzing continues] I give up, baby.
#unknown You're too good.
#unknown [Beeps]  Yeah? It's me, you got a minute? Yeah.
#unknown A minute.
#unknown What's up, Chow? The DEA, they call me to come back.
#unknown Say they want to talk more.
#unknown I'm sure they do.
#unknown [Toy whirring] Did you call your lawyer? Yeah, but, Mike, the DEA take all my money.
#unknown I need it.
#unknown I need my money.
#unknown You understand.
#unknown What do you want me to do about it? I don't know.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown We gotta talk.
#unknown Not on the phone.
#unknown Can you come to my house? All right.
#unknown Give me two hours.
#unknown [Beeps] [Whirring, soft thudding] [Whirring, thudding continue] [Mike] Chris.
#unknown I'd like you to drop your gun where you stand, and then turn around very slowly.
#unknown [Gun clatters] [Sighs] Come on over and sit next to Chow.
#unknown [Exhales forcefully] How much was she gonna pay you? Ten thousand a name.
#unknown How far did you get down the list? Just Chow.
#unknown I figured I'd start with you.
#unknown For you, she was gonna pay 30,000.
#unknown I'm very sorry about this, Mike.
#unknown But I needed the money.
#unknown Those feds, they took it all, man.
#unknown I know.
#unknown Are you ready? Listen, Mike [Shells clatter] [Exhales] [Woman] Kira, come and have some cookies.

#unknown Give me a kiss.
#unknown She said she wanted to wait for you.
#unknown She does, huh? Well, who's the adult here, Delores? Tell me she ate her dinner, at least.
#unknown [Delores] Oh, yes, she ate everything.
#unknown She ate her peas, she ate her carrots.
#unknown [Whispering] Do whatever it takes to keep them out of here, or they die.
#unknown Understand?  She ate a whole lot of carrots this time.
#unknown [Kira]  Yep.

#unknown Don't shoot me in the face.
#unknown Please.
#unknown I don't want my daughter seeing me like that.
#unknown Your daughter won't see you.
#unknown Yes, she will.
#unknown She'll find me.
#unknown She never once sleeps through the night.
#unknown Nobody's gonna find you, Lydia.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown What? No.

#unknown She has to know I didn't leave her.
#unknown She has to know that!  Keep your voice down.
#unknown I don't care what you do.
#unknown I'll scream and I'll keep screaming.
#unknown My daughter's not thinking I abandoned her! Shut up and calm down.
#unknown I don't care.
#unknown You have to promise.
#unknown You have to promise me [Door closes] Promise I don't disappear.
#unknown Can you still get your hands on methylamine? Methylamine, Lydia.
#unknown Can you still get it? Maybe.
#unknown Why? [Beeps] [Phone buzzing] Aww [Buzzing continues] Yes? [Mike] You still plan to move forward? Yes, we do.
