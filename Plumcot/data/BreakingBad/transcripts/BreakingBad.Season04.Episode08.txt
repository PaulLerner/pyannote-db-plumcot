#unknown Are we done? Listen, l This attack on my brotherinlaw, l don't know what it means.
#unknown Please.
#unknown l fear for my family.
#unknown l'm sure they'll be fine.
#unknown l'm told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.
#unknown lt's doubtful he'll live.
#unknown Now, thank me and shake my hand.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thank you again.
#unknown You're quite welcome, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Guys, guys, hurry up.
#unknown Can we go now? Upstairs, come on.
#unknown What's happening? Eight fortythree.
#unknown Time of death, 20:43.
#unknown Burn in hell, you piece of shit.
#unknown One of the gunmen died at the scene.
#unknown The second succumbed to his wounds earlier this evening.
#unknown Agents with the DEA and FBI in conjunction with APD are working with Mexican law enforcement in an attempt to identify the deceased suspects.
#unknown Both l can give you the highlights.
#unknown Your nephews grew impatient.
#unknown They continued to press me for my permission to kill Walter White.
#unknown When l wouldn't give it, they settled instead for DEA Agent Schrader.
#unknown But a phone call was placed to Agent Schrader moments before the attack.
#unknown Thus giving him the upper hand.
#unknown Marco was shot in the face and died instantly.
#unknown Leonel lingered for several hours.
#unknown The warning call to the DEA agent Juan Bolsa may have some insight into who placed it.
#unknown Yesterday, federales raided his hacienda.
#unknown And in the confusion, Juan was shot dead.
#unknown An accident, perhaps.
#unknown A mistake made by his own men.
#unknown Though we may never know.
#unknown At any rate, l thought you should hear it from me.
#unknown This is what comes of blood for blood, Hector.
#unknown So is this the loud one? What? No.
#unknown This is the PET/CT scan.
#unknown Positron emission tomography.
#unknown They've paired that with computed xray tomography.
#unknown Quiet.
#unknown No magnets.
#unknown Right, okay.
#unknown Yeah, thanks.
#unknown l'm still pretty new at this.
#unknown One minute, l'm starting a new business my wife and l are thinking about kids.
#unknown Walk into a doctor's office and suddenly.
#unknown l mean, life as l know it Excuse me.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown l'm waiting to hear a progress report on the thing we discussed, so call me.
#unknown Anyway, so for me, that's been the biggest wakeup call.
#unknown Letting go, giving up control.
#unknown You know, it's like they say, "Man plans and God laughs.
#unknown " That is such bullshit.
#unknown Excuse me? Never give up control.
#unknown Live life on your own terms.
#unknown Yeah, no, l get what you're saying but cancer is cancer, so.
#unknown To hell with your cancer.
#unknown l've been living with cancer for the better part of a year.
#unknown From the start, it's a death sentence.
#unknown That's what they keep telling me.
#unknown Well, guess what? Every life comes with a death sentence.
#unknown So every few months, l come in here for my regular scan knowing full well that one of these times Hell, maybe even today.
#unknown l'm gonna hear some bad news.
#unknown But until then who's in charge? Me.
#unknown That's how l live my life.
#unknown This residue here is why we descale with cool water from the walkin and not water from the tap.
#unknown Do it again, please.
#unknown Pollos Hermanos, where something delicious is always cooking.
#unknown Yes, detective.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Gustavo, thanks for coming.
#unknown Pleasure.
#unknown How's Kathi? Much better, thank you.
#unknown And you know Hank Schrader? Yes, indeed.
#unknown And Steve Gomez? How was your meal? Agent Schrader and l had a chance to catch up at one of my restaurants.
#unknown l'd eat there every day but l wouldn't fit through the door.
#unknown Well, should we get started? Yeah.
#unknown l'd like to record this conversation.
#unknown Of course.
#unknown The DEA is working on an investigation which may overlap with my own so l've asked them to sit in.
#unknown Gus, we all appreciate your coming in here to talk to us but you have the right to have an attorney present.
#unknown Oh, well, l can't see how that would be necessary.
#unknown But then, l have no idea why l'm here.
#unknown So you wish to continue? Please.
#unknown l'm very anxious to find out what this is all about.
#unknown Sir, your fingerprints were found at a crime scene.
#unknown Really? That's surprising.
#unknown A drugrelated homicide.
#unknown Gale Boetticher's apartment.
#unknown So you knew the victim? Fifteen years ago, l established a chemistry scholarship at UNM.
#unknown l named it after Maximino Arciniega a dear friend of mine who died young.
#unknown Gale was a recipient of this scholarship.
#unknown He was perhaps one of three dozen.
#unknown l see.
#unknown And Mr.
#unknown Boetticher graduated in.
#unknown 1 999.
#unknown That sounds right.
#unknown And you kept in contact with him over all this time? Oh, no.
#unknown l hadn't seen Gale for years until l ran into him a few weeks ago.
#unknown Ran into him where? At the restaurant.
#unknown Well, "ran into" isn't quite accurate, as l assumed he came by to reestablish contact with me.
#unknown We caught up briefly.
#unknown He invited me to dinner the following night and l accepted.
#unknown lt was perhaps a week later when l read about him in the paper.
#unknown Drug related, you said? lt's a good possibility.
#unknown The paper made no mention of that.
#unknown l assumed that it was a random crime.
#unknown So after years with no contact, he shows up in your restaurant and invites you to dinner? He wanted money.
#unknown Gale Boetticher asked for money? He didn't say that.
#unknown He spoke in terms of a vague investment opportunity.
#unknown But it was my suspicion, yes, as to why he invited me into his home.
#unknown He was a very, very talented chemist, but for reasons l never understood he was more interested in taking shortcuts than what would or could have been a very promising career.
#unknown Personal shortcomings notwithstanding he was a warm, gentle person and l thought a lot of him.
#unknown At any rate, l declined his business offer and after what was a very pleasant meal, left.
#unknown Can you tell us where you were on the night of wednesday the 23rd at around 8 p.
#unknown m.
#unknown ? Not an accusation, just a question.
#unknown No, l understand.
#unknown Let's see.
#unknown Twentythird.
#unknown l was at a fundraiser at Presbyterian Hospital.
#unknown l was there from 7 to about 1 0.
#unknown Anyone else? Sorry, yeah.
#unknown Just one other thing.
#unknown ls Gustavo Fring your real name? ls it my real name? l know you're a Chilean national but there are no records of you ever living there.
#unknown Really? l mean, records show that you immigrated to Mexico in 1 986 and years later, you were granted an entry visa to the United States.
#unknown But there's no record of Gustavo Fring ever having existed in Chile which l find, l don't know, strange.
#unknown Well, no, really, it isn't.
#unknown Pinochet's government was guilty of many sins.
#unknown First and foremost were human rights abuses.
#unknown But it was also notoriously unreliable at keeping records.
#unknown l'm sure if you keep digging, you'll find me.
#unknown Okay, l think that's it, Gus.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown l hope that l was of some small help.
#unknown You were, absolutely.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You're very welcome.
#unknown Good to see you again.
#unknown Oh, no.
#unknown No, please, please.
#unknown Don't get up.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Gentlemen.
#unknown So are we buying? This thing with his name? What are you thinking? Sure, the recordkeeping in South America's hit or miss.
#unknown l mean, we run into that all the time, right? But we usually find something.
#unknown Before '86 this guy's a ghost.
#unknown lf State Department wasn't satisfied, they wouldn't have naturalized him.
#unknown Well, maybe, but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.
#unknown State just wasn't as tough on background checks pre9/1 1 .
#unknown l don't know what this has to do with the case at hand.
#unknown l was curious when his print showed up at Boetticher's apartment.
#unknown For me, the scholarship explains it.
#unknown l'll admit to a certain degree of bias.
#unknown This man has been a longtime friend of DEA.
#unknown But that being said, l thought his story was credible.
#unknown Well, l agree.
#unknown l think it was a good story.
#unknown Still, why are we hearing it now? What do you mean? Well, like you said, he's a This man is a big law enforcement booster.
#unknown He's reading the newspaper and sees that someone he had dinner with someone he thought a lot of was murdered.
#unknown He reads this and he doesn't make a phone call? Didn't call you or one of his other cop friends to share his connection with the case or ask about the investigation? We can't predicate a criminal investigation on a person not making phone calls.
#unknown What do you think, Tim? Well, l wanna follow up on the scholarship, the alibi but my overall impression? l believed him.
#unknown Nice touch.
#unknown Birdbath.
#unknown Hey, tiger, how's it hanging? Good.
#unknown Yeah, so very nice.
#unknown What's the damage? Twelve hundred a month.
#unknown l did a lot of research.
#unknown That's a pretty good deal.
#unknown You kidding me? That's a great deal.
#unknown Speaking of which that's for the week.
#unknown Plus there's a little extra in there for any moverelated incidentals.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Hey, champ, how's the new school? Good.
#unknown l loved school when l was your age.
#unknown Seesaws, story time, chasing girls with sticks.
#unknown lt wasn't until the fifth grade that l found out she liked me too but by then her family had moved to Scottsdale, so.
#unknown Carpe diem, okay? Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Good boy.
#unknown So you'll thank Jesse again from both of us? You got it.
#unknown So is he How's he doing? Jesse? He's good.
#unknown He's busy.
#unknown How is it? Space, lots of light.
#unknown lt's Little garden out back.
#unknown lt's nice.
#unknown And Brock? How's he doing? Hey, look, l don't mind dropping checks off every week like Ed McMahon but if you wanna know how they're doing why don't you go see for yourself? l'll catch you later.
#unknown Hey, you gonna need a ride home? No.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Anyway, l'm proud for not losing my cool.
#unknown Plus, it shows our crew that l will support them if a customer's being rude.
#unknown You're really taking to this whole beyourownboss thing.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown l guess l am.
#unknown Actually l'm thinking about making the move up to management.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Corporate America, look out.
#unknown Excuse me, l would be a vast improvement.
#unknown No one in Kleinman's entire front office knows about giving an xray which is just.
#unknown Hey, Dad, whatever happened with your scan? Did you get the results back? Yeah, l did and l'm still in remission.
#unknown So you're all gonna have to be stuck with me for a while longer.
#unknown Cheers, buddy.
#unknown What about you, Hank? How you feeling these days? You know, getting there.
#unknown The other day, he had a big powwow with all the DEA mucketymucks.
#unknown What was that about? Nothing.
#unknown Just a deadend.
#unknown He won't tell me, either.
#unknown Apparently, it's all very hushhush.
#unknown Hey, Walt, do me a favor? Marie's working tomorrow and there's a gem and mineral show opening at the fairgrounds.
#unknown l wondered if you could give me a lift? Yeah.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown l had a collection of my own in high school.
#unknown l mean, nothing fancy.
#unknown Just entrylevel beryls and garnets one passable black tourmaline.
#unknown Turn right here.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown But l did have one piece of morganite that was very special.
#unknown lt'd been heattreated, so it had that classic cast to it.
#unknown That rose, almost salmon hue, you know? Hey, Walt, there's no rock show, okay? l just said that so Marie wouldn't freak.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Take a right here.
#unknown Freak about what? Hank, where are we going? Are you hungry? We're not here for the chicken.
#unknown Kill the engine.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You ready for your mind to be blown? Sure.
#unknown Gustavo Fring, remember him? He came to the hospital after the shooting.
#unknown Put up the reward? He sponsors the DEA Fun Run every year.
#unknown You've met him? Yeah, the Fun Run guy.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That guy, yeah.
#unknown What about him? Well, l suspect l can't prove it, mind you, but l suspect the man's a drug dealer.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Methamphetamine.
#unknown l mean, honest to God, l really believe that this guy may be one of the biggest movers in the southwest.
#unknown Remember Gale Boetticher? That sad sack from the karaoke tape? Yeah.
#unknown And you said that he didn't strike you as being the bossman type? That there was a bigger guy out there.
#unknown Hank, that was just speculation.
#unknown Doesn't matter.
#unknown lt made me keep at it.
#unknown And guess what l find? Chicken Man's fingerprints at Boetticher's murder scene.
#unknown So we bring him in You think that Gustavo Fring killed Gale Boetticher? Probably not.
#unknown These guys usually get a dunce to pull the trigger, right? But his fingerprints being there was enough to bring him in.
#unknown So l So you brought him in to the police? Right.
#unknown He sits down to talk with us, the problem is that What did you ask him? What did he say? Walt, will you let me finish my story here? Sorry, l'm just interested, you know? All right.
#unknown whatever.
#unknown So we bring him in and he proceeds to kick our asses.
#unknown Okay? He's got an explanation for the fingerprints.
#unknown He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.
#unknown He's got reasons for everything.
#unknown This guy is Terms ofEndearment convincing.
#unknown So he's not guilty? Yeah.
#unknown As far as DEA and APD are concerned, he's not.
#unknown Officially, Fring's not a suspect.
#unknown But l'm telling you something deep down says he's my guy.
#unknown Just gotta prove it.
#unknown Hank, why are you telling me this? l need a favor.
#unknown What favor? You see that Volvo station wagon over there? The guy drives a 1 0yearold Volvo.
#unknown lt's brilliant.
#unknown Anyway, listen what l need for you to do stick this on it.
#unknown GPS tracker.
#unknown Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around on her but she wants to be sure? Stick this on the car This part here, it's a magnet.
#unknown and see where he goes.
#unknown Cool, huh? Two eightynine from SkyMall.
#unknown lt's not liveview, so we gotta come back later and take it off and stick it in the computer.
#unknown Still, a pretty amazing time we're living in.
#unknown Hank, isn't that illegal? l mean, isn't there some sort of unlawful search and something lt's known as extralegal.
#unknown But trust me, it's our little secret.
#unknown Look, it's easy, okay? Here's what you do.
#unknown You untie your shoelace and you head toward the restaurant.
#unknown You're walking past the car look down and, "Hey, darn, my shoe's untied.
#unknown " Okay? Now, when you bend down to tie your shoe you stick this into the wheel well.
#unknown Then you go inside and l don't know Hank, l don't feel good about this.
#unknown l know that this kind of thing is outside your comfort zone No, l mean it.
#unknown This is a mistake.
#unknown Walt, l need you to help me out here, okay? This is really important to me.
#unknown Are you gonna make me beg? Come on.
#unknown Just stick it in there.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Just act normal.
#unknown May l help you? l l Sir, may l help you? l didn't do it.
#unknown See? l didn't do it.
#unknown Do it.
#unknown Do it.
#unknown May l help you with your order? What the hell is he? Just made sure it was secure.
#unknown Hey, where's my soda? Just kidding.
#unknown Let's go.
#unknown Let's go.
#unknown Yes, that one.
#unknown l swear to God, l thought l was driving the man to a gem and mineral show.
#unknown All of a sudden he has me pulling into your restaurant and telling me that he's investigating you.
#unknown Look, you and l, we've had our differences but l would never Look, my brotherinlaw, evidencewise, has nothing.
#unknown He's operating on pure conjecture.
#unknown And no one, not one person that he works with thinks that you are anyone other than an owner of a fastfood chain.
#unknown But if something were to happen to Hank? That would only draw their attention to you and therefore, to me, as well.
#unknown We have a mutual interest in resolving this without violence.
#unknown l will make sure that he discovers nothing.
#unknown Jesse! What? Oh, hey.
#unknown Don't wait to be, like, invited.
#unknown Are we alone? So where do we stand? Where do we stand on what? Where do we stand with the thing that you were supposed to do? l assume you haven't done it.
#unknown You didn't lose it, did you? You would tell me if you lost it, right? Oh, Jesus.
#unknown Asshole.
#unknown You're creaming to get it done, go do it yourself.
#unknown lf he didn't see me coming like he's some kind of.
#unknown All right, look.
#unknown Our timetable has advanced.
#unknown You have got to make this meeting happen this week.
#unknown Tomorrow.
#unknown Tonight, if possible.
#unknown Oh, tonight.
#unknown What are you, high? My brotherinlaw, my DEA agent brotherinlaw? He's onto Gus.
#unknown Did you hear what l just said? My brotherinlaw is onto Gus.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, yeah, l got it, your brotherinlaw.
#unknown Okay, l'm thinking.
#unknown Look.
#unknown So, what if this is like math or algebra? We add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag and you get, like, zero douche bags.
#unknown l've got some math for you.
#unknown Hank catching Gus equals Hank catching us.
#unknown Hank, he's relentless, all right? He won't quit.
#unknown Yeah, well, he's got nothing, is all l can say.
#unknown How would you know that? Because he's still above ground.
#unknown Think a dude like Gus would let your boy anywhere near him? He'll break out his box cutter on his sorry gimp ass.
#unknown So you haven't even seen him since that time at the diner? Okay.
#unknown Think.
#unknown All right.
#unknown They've got to be figuring that we've talked.
#unknown So you need to tell Mike that you are worried about Hank's investigation.
#unknown Okay? Hank already knows who you are, by the way.
#unknown And besides, you actually did kill Gale, so there's that.
#unknown This is all good fodder for you to request a sitdown with Gus so you can discuss what you would say for questioning.
#unknown Okay? Now, you just say that you want to be No, that you need to be able to be properly coached.
#unknown Then, when you're near him you put this to use.
#unknown Mike's just gonna tell me to shut my mouth if l get busted.
#unknown He ain't gonna set up no meeting.
#unknown Well, then insist on it, damn it! Act panicked.
#unknown Gus' ass is on the line.
#unknown He'll meet with you if he thinks you're a liability.
#unknown No.
#unknown He will waste me if he thinks l'm a liability.
#unknown You know what? Whatever, man.
#unknown l'm gonna take a piss.
#unknown l think you got a phone call.
#unknown Anything important? Yes? l did some digging around.
#unknown And? Neither the DEA nor the APD considers you a person of interest.
#unknown Schrader is looking into you totally on his lonesome.
#unknown A voice in the wilderness.
#unknown Does he have resources? Just him, his credit card and his chauffeur Walter.
#unknown He'd be committing career suicide if he were to mention you to Merkert again.
#unknown No warrant for that tracking device? No.
#unknown The guy has gone totally maverick.
#unknown He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.
#unknown We watch our backs, we don't throw him any bones.
#unknown He'll never make a case.
#unknown What about Chile? lf l can't find any trace before '89 l seriously doubt Schrader can.
#unknown Seems to me the bigger problem is the cartel.
#unknown Now, we can handle them if that's all we've got on our plate.
#unknown But dealing with both Schrader and the Mexicans at the same time? lf he happens to be watching when they make a move it could be the perfect storm.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown l'll be in touch.
#unknown I don't know how many grandmas and grandpas we got.
#unknown ls there a couple of them in viewing land? Well, it's "The Grandparent's Polka.
#unknown " Hello, Hector.
#unknown The cartel has given me its ultimatum.
#unknown To which l've said no.
#unknown DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.
#unknown He's looking into my past.
#unknown ls today the day, Hector? Gustavo, sit down.
#unknown You're making me nervous.
#unknown lt's a good plan.
#unknown Trust yourself.
#unknown Everything is going to be okay.
#unknown Are you crazy? The boss is gonna rip your balls off! What, you gonna tell? And you? They ain't gonna say nothing.
#unknown They like what they see.
#unknown You're not going to offer our guests anything? Who says they're guests? lf the boss wants them to drink they drink.
#unknown Sothe Chicken Brothers.
#unknown l like your restaurant.
#unknown Dark meat and white meat? Don't look like no brothers to me.
#unknown At last! The master chefs! You two.
#unknown That chicken you cook.
#unknown l swear, it has got to be the tastiest chicken in all of Mexico.
#unknown Thank you, Don Eladio.
#unknown lt's a great honor.
#unknown Max is the chef.
#unknown The compliments are all his.
#unknown Gustavo is too modest.
#unknown There'd be no restaurant without him.
#unknown Well, however you two do it, keep it up.
#unknown Your chicken, it's sozesty.
#unknown Piquant.
#unknown But it does not taste like a Mexican style.
#unknown lt's a recipe l learned in Chile which l've modified a bit for the Mexican palate.
#unknown l bet we like a little more chili than you Chileans.
#unknown We Mexicans like a good hard kick! Soif your partner is the chef then who are you? Don't tell me you are just the taster! l handle the business operations.
#unknown Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.
#unknown Es el businessman.
#unknown Good, good.
#unknown But tell me something.
#unknown That chicken, so fabulous so excellent.
#unknown Besides that, what else do you have on your menu? We have several side dishes.
#unknown Rice.
#unknown Beans.
#unknown Sometimes we prepare a carnitas entrÃ©e if we come across fresh beef in the market.
#unknown Anything else? Come on, be honest.
#unknown There is nothing else you offer? A little taste of something else? Something on the side? Because when l send my men to your restaurant they come back with more than just chicken.
#unknown They come back with drugs.
#unknown Regresan high.
#unknown You are selling them narcotics.
#unknown Methamphetamine.
#unknown With all due respect, Don Eladio.
#unknown l didn't sell it to them.
#unknown l gave them samples.
#unknown Samples.
#unknown Some businessman.
#unknown l gave them samples to give to you.
#unknown To introduce you to our product.
#unknown Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offense.
#unknown But hethat is to say we could think of no other way to get your attention.
#unknown We want to work with you, Don Eladio.
#unknown l know all about methamphetamine.
#unknown That's poor man's cocaine.
#unknown Only bikers and hillbillies use it.
#unknown There's no money in it.
#unknown May l, Don Eladio.
#unknown l am a biochemist by training.
#unknown The methamphetamine we make is much superior to the socalled biker crank you know of.
#unknown lt is crystallized, like glass.
#unknown Purer.
#unknown And the chirality of the molecule its very structure, is different.
#unknown The narcotic effect is far more potent.
#unknown This product is the drug of the future.
#unknown lt'll triple your profits.
#unknown Perhaps quadruple.
#unknown They're not only good cooks they're great at shoveling manure.
#unknown Right now, you deal almost exclusively with cocaine.
#unknown But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico.
#unknown You are no more than middlemen for the Colombians.
#unknown They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border.
#unknown But the lion's share of the profits goes to them despite your assumption of all the risk.
#unknown This new crystal methamphetamine.
#unknown lt's stronger, more addictive than cocaine which means it will move in higher volume.
#unknown But most importantly, it's completely artificial.
#unknown We can show you how to manufacture it right here in Mexico.
#unknown And you keep all the profits.
#unknown My men do like your product.
#unknown Hector, what is wrong with you? Why did you not get glasses for our guests? Go on.
#unknown You are quite the talent.
#unknown l bet you learned cooking from your mama.
#unknown lsn't that true? Butwhat about the chemistry? l studied at the University of Santiago.
#unknown Gustavo paid for my education.
#unknown Oh, really? l have degrees in both biochemistry and chemical engineering.
#unknown With minimal capital investment we can set up a factorygrade laboratory for you.
#unknown Train your own people to manufacture large quantities of highly pure methamphetamine.
#unknown Fantastic! Tell me one thing, though.
#unknown lf you're the cook.
#unknown Why do l need him? SeÃ±or? You.
#unknown Businessman.
#unknown Why should l negotiate with someone who doesn't respect me? Who insults me by dealing under my nose without my permission? Who manipulates me into a meeting in front of my own men? What do l need you for? Don Eladio.
#unknown Please.
#unknown l didn't sell anything.
#unknown l apologize if you are offended by my method of obtaining this meeting.
#unknown l merely took the initiative.
#unknown l meant no insult.
#unknown Don Eladio, Gustavo didn't mean to offend.
#unknown l know Gustavo like a brother.
#unknown He's an honorable man.
#unknown The most loyal man l have ever known.
#unknown He rescued me from the Santiago slums.
#unknown He made me the man l am today! Gustavo is a genius.
#unknown He will make you millions! Just find it in your heart to forgive him this one small mistake.
#unknown Please He's my partner.
#unknown l need him! l swear to God! Look at him.
#unknown You did this to him.
#unknown Now, look at him.
#unknown Listen to me.
#unknown The only reason you are alive and he is not is because l know who you are.
#unknown But understand.
#unknown You are not in Chile anymore.
#unknown My advice.
#unknown Stick to chicken.
#unknown Look at me, Hector.
#unknown Look at me.
#unknown Maybe next time.
#unknown
