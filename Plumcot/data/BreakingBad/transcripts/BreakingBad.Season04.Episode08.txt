walter_white  This attack on my brotherinlaw, l don't know what it means.
Walter_White  Please.
walter_white  l fear for my family.
gustavo_fring  l'm sure they'll be fine.
gustavo_fring  l'm told the assassin that survived is gravely injured.
gustavo_fring  lt's doubtful he'll live. Now, thank me and shake my hand
walter_white  Thank you.
walter_white  Thank you again.
gustavo_fring  You're quite welcome, Mr.
unknown  White
unknown  White. Guys, guys, hurry up. Can we go now? Upstairs, come on.
walter_white  What's happening?
unknown  Eight fortythree.
unknown  Time of death
steven_gomez  Burn
unknown  One of the gunmen died at the scene.
unknown  The second succumbed to his wounds earlier this evening. Agents
unknown  Agents with the DEA and FBI in conjunction with APD are working with Mexican law enforcement in an attempt to identify the deceased suspects.
gustavo_fring  l can give you the highlights.
gustavo_fring  Your nephews grew impatient.
gustavo_fring  They continued to press me for my permission to kill Walter
gustavo_fring  White. When l wouldn't give it, they settled instead for DEA Agent Schrader.
gustavo_fring  But a phone call was placed to Agent Schrader moments before the attack.
gustavo_fring  Thus giving him the upper hand.
gustavo_fring  Marco was shot in the face and died instantly.
gustavo_fring  Leonel lingered for several hours.
gustavo_fring  The warning call to the DEA agent Juan Bolsa may have some insight into who placed
gustavo_fring  it. Yesterday, federales raided his hacienda. And
gustavo_fring  in the confusion, Juan was shot dead.
gustavo_fring  An accident, perhaps.
gustavo_fring  A mistake made by his own men.
gustavo_fring  Though we may never know
gustavo_fring  At any rate, l thought you should hear it from me.
gustavo_fring  This is what comes of blood for blood, Hector.
gary  So is this the loud
gary  one?
gary  What? No. This
walter_white  This is the PET/CT scan.
walter_white  Positron emission tomography.
walter_white  They've paired that with computed xray tomography.
walter_white  Quiet.
walter_white  No magnets.
gary  okay.
gary  Yeah, thanks.
gary  still pretty new at
gary  this. One minute, l'm starting a new business my wife and l are thinking about kids.
gary  Walk into a doctor's office and suddenly. l mean, life as l know it
walter_white  Yes.
walter_white  l'm waiting to hear a progress report on the thing we discussed, so call me.
gary  Anyway, so for me, that's been the biggest wakeup call.
gary  Letting go, giving up control.
gary  know, it's like they say," Man plans and God laughs."
walter_white  That is such bullshit.
gary  Excuse me?
walter_white  Never give up control.
walter_white  Live life on your own terms.
gary  Yeah, no, l get what you're saying but cancer is cancer,
walter_white  To hell with your cancer.
walter_white  l've been living with cancer for the better part of a year.
walter_white  From the start, it's a death sentence.
walter_white  That's what they keep telling me.
walter_white  Well, guess what?
walter_white  Every life comes with a death sentence.
walter_white  So every few months, l come in here for my regular scan knowing full well that one of these times
walter_white  Hell, maybe even today.
walter_white  l'm gonna hear some bad news.
walter_white  But until then who's in charge?
walter_white  Me.
walter_white  how l live my life.
gustavo_fring  This residue here is why we descale with cool water from the walkin and not water from the tap.
gustavo_fring  Do it again, please.
gustavo_fring  Pollos Hermanos, where something delicious is always cooking.
gustavo_fring  Yes, detective.
george_merkert  Yeah. Gustavo, thanks for coming.
gustavo_fring  Pleasure. How's
gustavo_fring  How's Kathi?
george_merkert  Much better, thank you.
tim_roberts  And you know Hank Schrader?
gustavo_fring  Yes, indeed.
tim_roberts  And Steve Gomez?
gustavo_fring  How was your meal?
gustavo_fring  Agent Schrader and l had a chance to catch up at one of my restaurants. l'd eat
hank_schrader  eat there every day but l wouldn't fit through the door.
tim_roberts  Well, should we get started?
hank_schrader  Yeah
tim_roberts  l'd like to record this conversation. Of
gustavo_fring  Of course.
tim_roberts  The DEA is working on an investigation which may overlap with my own so l've asked them to sit in. Gus
george_merkert  Gus, we all appreciate your coming in here to talk to us but you have the right to have an attorney present. Oh,
gustavo_fring  well, l can't see how that would be necessary.
gustavo_fring  But then, l have no idea why l'm here.
tim_roberts  So you wish to continue?
gustavo_fring  Please.
gustavo_fring  l'm very anxious to find out what this is all about.
tim_roberts  Sir, your fingerprints were found at a crime scene.
gustavo_fring  That's surprising.
tim_roberts  A drugrelated homicide.
gustavo_fring  Gale Boetticher's apartment.
tim_roberts  So you knew the victim?
gustavo_fring  Fifteen years ago, l established a chemistry scholarship at UNM.
gustavo_fring  named it after Maximino Arciniega a dear friend of mine who died young.
gustavo_fring  Gale was a recipient of this scholarship.
gustavo_fring  He was perhaps one of three dozen.
tim_roberts  l see
tim_roberts  And Mr. Boetticher graduated in.
hank_schrader  1 999.
gustavo_fring  That sounds right.
tim_roberts  And you kept in contact with him over all this time? Oh
gustavo_fring  Oh, no.
gustavo_fring  l hadn't seen Gale for years until l ran into him a few weeks ago.
tim_roberts  Ran into him where?
gustavo_fring  At the restaurant.
gustavo_fring  Well," ran into" isn't quite accurate, as l assumed he came by to reestablish contact with me.
gustavo_fring  We caught up briefly.
gustavo_fring  He invited me to dinner the following night and l accepted.
gustavo_fring  lt was perhaps a week later when l read about him in the paper.
gustavo_fring  Drug related, you said?
tim_roberts  lt's a good possibility.
gustavo_fring  The paper made no mention of that.
gustavo_fring  l assumed that it was a random crime.
hank_schrader  So after years with no contact, he shows up in your restaurant and invites you to dinner?
gustavo_fring  He wanted money.
tim_roberts  Gale Boetticher asked for money?
gustavo_fring  He didn't say that.
gustavo_fring  He spoke in terms of a vague investment opportunity.
gustavo_fring  But it was my suspicion, yes, as to why he invited me into his home.
gustavo_fring  He was a very, very talented chemist, but for reasons l never understood he was more interested in taking shortcuts than what would or could have been a very promising career.
gustavo_fring  Personal shortcomings notwithstanding he was a warm, gentle person and l thought a lot of him.
gustavo_fring  At any rate, l declined his business offer and after what was a very pleasant meal, left.
tim_roberts  Can you tell us where you were on the night of wednesday the 23rd at around 8 p. m.
tim_roberts  Not an accusation, just a question.
gustavo_fring  No, l understand.
gustavo_fring  Let's see.
gustavo_fring  Twentythird.
gustavo_fring  l was at a fundraiser at Presbyterian Hospital
gustavo_fring  Hospital. l was there from 7 to about 1 0.
tim_roberts  Anyone else?
hank_schrader  Sorry, yeah.
hank_schrader  Just one other thing.
hank_schrader  ls Gustavo Fring your real name?
gustavo_fring  ls it my real name?
hank_schrader  l know you're a Chilean national but there are no records of you ever living there.
gustavo_fring  Really?
hank_schrader  l mean, records show that you immigrated to Mexico in 1 986 and years later, you were granted an entry visa to the United States.
hank_schrader  But there's no record of Gustavo Fring ever having existed in Chile which l find, l don't know, strange.
gustavo_fring  Well, no, really, it isn't.
gustavo_fring  Pinochet's government was guilty of many sins.
gustavo_fring  First and foremost were human rights abuses.
gustavo_fring  But it was also notoriously unreliable at keeping records.
gustavo_fring  l'm sure if you keep digging, you'll find me
george_merkert  Okay, l think that's it, Gus.
george_merkert  Thank you.
gustavo_fring  l hope that l was of some small help.
tim_roberts  You were, absolutely.
tim_roberts  Thank you.
gustavo_fring  You're very welcome.
gustavo_fring  Good to see you again.
gustavo_fring  Oh,
gustavo_fring  No, please, please.
gustavo_fring  Don't get up.
hank_schrader  So are we buying?
tim_roberts  This thing with his name?
tim_roberts  What are you thinking?
hank_schrader  Sure, the recordkeeping in South America's hit or miss.
hank_schrader  l mean, we run into that all the time, right?
hank_schrader  we usually find something.
hank_schrader  Before '86 this guy's a ghost.
steven_gomez  lf State Department wasn't satisfied, they wouldn't have naturalized him. Well
hank_schrader  Well, maybe, but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.
hank_schrader  State just wasn't as tough on background checks pre9/1 1
steven_gomez  1. l don't know what this has to do with the case at hand.
steven_gomez  l was curious when his print showed up at Boetticher's apartment.
steven_gomez  For me, the scholarship explains it.
george_merkert  l'll admit to a certain degree of bias.
george_merkert  This man has been a longtime friend of DEA. But
george_merkert  But that being said, l thought his story was credible.
hank_schrader  Well, l agree.
hank_schrader  l think it was a good story.
hank_schrader  Still, why are we hearing it now?
george_merkert  What do you mean?
hank_schrader  Well, like you said, he's a This man is a big law enforcement booster.
hank_schrader  He's reading the newspaper and sees that someone he had dinner with someone he thought a lot of was murdered.
hank_schrader  He reads this and he doesn't make a phone call?
hank_schrader  Didn't call you or one of his other cop friends to share his connection with the case or ask about the investigation?
george_merkert  We can't predicate a criminal investigation on a person not making phone calls.
hank_schrader  do you think, Tim?
tim_roberts  Well, l wanna follow up on the scholarship, the alibi but my overall impression?
tim_roberts  l believed him.
saul_goodman  touch.
saul_goodman  Birdbath. Hey, tiger, how's it hanging?
saul_goodman  Yeah, so very nice.
saul_goodman  What's the damage?
andrea_cantillo  Twelve hundred a month.
andrea_cantillo  l did a lot of research.
andrea_cantillo  That's a pretty good deal.
saul_goodman  You kidding me?
saul_goodman  That's a great deal.
saul_goodman  Speaking of which that's for the week.
saul_goodman  Plus there's a little extra in there for any moverelated incidentals. Thank
andrea_cantillo  Thank you.
saul_goodman  Hey, champ, how's the new school?
brock_cantillo  Good. l
saul_goodman  l loved school when l was your age.
saul_goodman  Seesaws, story time, chasing girls with sticks.
saul_goodman  wasn't until the fifth grade that l found out she liked me too but by then her family had moved to Scottsdale, so.
saul_goodman  Carpe diem, okay?
brock_cantillo  Okay.
saul_goodman  right. Good
saul_goodman  Good boy.
andrea_cantillo  So you'll thank Jesse again from both of us?
saul_goodman  You got it.
andrea_cantillo  So is he How's he doing?
saul_goodman  Jesse?
saul_goodman  He's good.
saul_goodman  He's busy.
jesse_pinkman  How is it?
saul_goodman  Space, lots of light.
saul_goodman  lt's Little garden out back.
saul_goodman  lt's nice.
jesse_pinkman  And Brock? How's he doing?
saul_goodman  Hey, look, l don't mind dropping checks off every week like Ed McMahon but if you wanna know how they're doing why don't you go see for yourself?
jesse_pinkman  l'll catch you later.
saul_goodman  Hey, you gonna need a ride home?
jesse_pinkman  No.
skyler_white  Anyway, l'm proud for not losing my cool.
skyler_white  Plus, it shows our crew that l will support them if a customer's being rude. You're
marie_schrader  You're really taking to this whole beyourownboss thing. Yeah.
skyler_white  l guess l am.
marie_schrader  Actually l'm thinking about making the move up to management.
hank_schrader  Jesus. Corporate
hank_schrader  Corporate America, look out.
marie_schrader  Excuse me, l would be a vast improvement.
marie_schrader  No one in Kleinman's entire front office knows about giving an xray which is just.
walter_white_jr.  Hey, Dad, whatever happened with your scan?
walter_white_jr.  Did you get the results back?
walter_white  Yeah, l did and l'm still in remission.
walter_white  So you're all gonna have to be stuck with me for a while longer.
hank_schrader  Cheers
walter_white  about you, Hank?
walter_white  How you feeling these days?
hank_schrader  You know, getting there.
marie_schrader  other day, he had a big powwow with all the DEA mucketymucks.
walter_white  What was that about?
walter_white  He
marie_schrader  He won't tell me, either.
marie_schrader  Apparently, it's all very hushhush.
hank_schrader  Hey, Walt, do me a favor?
hank_schrader  Marie's working tomorrow and there's a gem and mineral show opening at the fairgrounds.
hank_schrader  l wondered if you could give me a lift?
walter_white  Sure
walter_white  had a collection of my own in high school.
walter_white  l mean, nothing fancy.
walter_white  Just entrylevel beryls and garnets one passable black tourmaline.
hank_schrader  Turn right here.
walter_white  Okay.
walter_white  But l did have one piece of morganite that was very special.
walter_white  lt'd been heattreated, so it had that classic cast to it
walter_white  That rose, almost salmon hue, you know?
hank_schrader  Hey, Walt, there's no rock show, okay?
hank_schrader  l just said that so Marie wouldn't freak.
hank_schrader  Take a right
hank_schrader  right here.
walter_white  Freak about what
walter_white  you hungry?
hank_schrader  We're not here for the chicken.
hank_schrader  Kill the engine.
hank_schrader  You ready for your mind to be blown?
hank_schrader  Gustavo Fring, remember him
hank_schrader  He came to the hospital after the shooting.
hank_schrader  Put up the reward?
hank_schrader  He sponsors the DEA Fun Run every year.
hank_schrader  You've met him?
walter_white  Yeah, the Fun Run guy.
walter_white  Yeah
walter_white  Yeah. That guy, yeah.
walter_white  What about him?
hank_schrader  Well, l suspect l can't prove it, mind you, but l suspect the man's a drug dealer.
hank_schrader  Methamphetamine.
hank_schrader  mean, honest to God, l really believe that this guy may be one of the biggest movers in the southwest.
hank_schrader  Remember Gale Boetticher?
hank_schrader  That sad sack from the karaoke tape? Yeah
walter_white  Yeah. And
hank_schrader  And you said that he didn't strike you as being the bossman type?
hank_schrader  That there was a bigger guy out there.
walter_white  Hank, that was just speculation
hank_schrader  speculation. Doesn't matter.
hank_schrader  lt made me keep at it
hank_schrader  And guess what l find?
hank_schrader  Chicken Man's fingerprints at Boetticher's murder scene.
hank_schrader  So we bring him in You
walter_white  You think that Gustavo Fring killed Gale Boetticher?
hank_schrader  Probably not.
hank_schrader  These guys usually get a dunce to pull the trigger, right? But
hank_schrader  But his fingerprints being there was enough to bring him in.
hank_schrader  So l
walter_white  l So you brought him in to the police?
hank_schrader  Right.
hank_schrader  He sits down to talk with us, the problem is that What
walter_white  What did you ask him?
walter_white  What did he say?
hank_schrader  Walt, will you let me finish my story here?
walter_white  Sorry, l'm just interested, you know? All right. whatever.
hank_schrader  So we bring him in and he proceeds to kick our asses.
hank_schrader  Okay?
hank_schrader  He's got an explanation for the fingerprints.
hank_schrader  He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.
hank_schrader  He's got reasons for everything.
hank_schrader  This guy is Terms ofEndearment convincing.
walter_white  So he's not guilty?
hank_schrader  Yeah. As
hank_schrader  As far as DEA and APD are concerned, he's not.
hank_schrader  Officially, Fring's not a suspect.
hank_schrader  But l'm telling you something deep down says he's my guy.
hank_schrader  Just gotta prove it
walter_white  Hank, why are you telling me this?
hank_schrader  l need a favor.
walter_white  What favor? You
hank_schrader  see that Volvo station wagon over there?
hank_schrader  The guy drives a 1 0yearold Volvo. lt's
hank_schrader  lt's brilliant.
hank_schrader  Anyway, listen what l need for you to do stick this on it
hank_schrader  GPS tracker.
hank_schrader  Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around on her but she wants to be sure?
hank_schrader  Stick this on the car This part here, it's a magnet.
hank_schrader  and see where he goes.
hank_schrader  Cool,

walter_white  in. Hank, isn't that illegal?
walter_white  l mean, isn't there some sort of unlawful search and something lt's
hank_schrader  lt's known as extralegal.
hank_schrader  But trust me, it's our little secret.
hank_schrader  it's easy, okay?
hank_schrader  Here's what you do.
hank_schrader  You untie your shoelace and you head toward the restaurant.
hank_schrader  You're walking past the car look down and," Hey, darn, my shoe's untied.
hank_schrader  Okay?
hank_schrader  Now, when you bend down to tie your shoe you stick this into the wheel well.
hank_schrader  Then you go inside and l don't
walter_white  don't know Hank, l don't feel good about this.
hank_schrader  l know that this kind of thing is outside your comfort zone
walter_white  zone No, l mean it
walter_white  it. This is a mistake.
hank_schrader  l need you to help me out here, okay?
hank_schrader  This is really important to me. Are
hank_schrader  you gonna make me beg?

hank_schrader  Just kidding. Let's go. Let's go
unknown  Yes, that one
walter_white  l swear to God, l thought l was driving the man to a gem and mineral show.
walter_white  All of a sudden he has me pulling into your restaurant and telling me that he's investigating you.
walter_white  Look, you and l, we've had our differences but l would
walter_white  Look, my brotherinlaw, evidencewise, has nothing.
walter_white  He's operating on pure conjecture.
walter_white  And no one, not one person that he works with thinks that you are anyone other than an owner of a fastfood chain.
walter_white  But if something were to happen to Hank?
walter_white  That would only draw their attention to you and therefore, to me, as well.
walter_white  We have a mutual interest in resolving this without violence.
walter_white  l will make sure that he discovers nothing.
jesse_pinkman  Oh, hey.
jesse_pinkman  Don't wait to be, like, invited.
walter_white  Are we alone?
walter_white  So where do we stand?
jesse_pinkman  stand on what?
walter_white  Where do we stand with the thing that you were supposed to do?
walter_white  l assume you haven't done it.
walter_white  You didn't lose it, did you?
walter_white  You would tell me if you lost it, right?
jesse_pinkman  Oh, Jesus.
walter_white  Asshole.
jesse_pinkman  creaming to get it done, go do it yourself. lf he
walter_white  he didn't see me coming like he's some kind of.

walter_white  Our timetable has advanced.
walter_white  You have got to make this meeting happen this week.
walter_white  Tomorrow.
walter_white  Tonight, if possible.
jesse_pinkman  Oh, tonight.
jesse_pinkman  you, high?
walter_white  My brotherinlaw, my DEA agent brotherinlaw?
walter_white  He's onto Gus.
walter_white  Did you hear what l just said?
walter_white  My brotherinlaw is onto Gus.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, yeah, yeah, l got it, your brotherinlaw. Okay
jesse_pinkman  Okay, l'm thinking.
jesse_pinkman  So, what if this is like math or algebra?
jesse_pinkman  We add a plus douche bag to a minus douche bag and you get, like, zero douche bags.
walter_white  l've got some math for you.
walter_white  Hank catching Gus equals Hank catching us.
walter_white  Hank, he's relentless, all right?
walter_white  He won't quit.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, well, he's got nothing, is all l can say.
walter_white  How would you know that? Because
jesse_pinkman  Because he's still above ground.
jesse_pinkman  Think a dude like Gus would let your boy anywhere near him?
jesse_pinkman  He'll break out his box cutter on his sorry gimp ass.
walter_white  So you haven't even seen him since that time at the diner?
walter_white  Think.
walter_white  right. They've got to be figuring that we've talked. So
walter_white  So you need to tell Mike that you are worried about Hank's investigation.
walter_white  Okay?
walter_white  Hank already knows who you are, by the way.
walter_white  And besides, you actually did kill Gale, so there's that.
walter_white  This is all good fodder for you to request a sitdown with Gus so you can discuss what you would say for questioning. Okay
walter_white  Okay?
walter_white  Now, you just say that you want to be No
walter_white  No, that you need to be able to be properly coached.
walter_white  Then, when you're near him you put this to use.
jesse_pinkman  Mike's just gonna tell me to shut my mouth if l get busted.
jesse_pinkman  He ain't gonna set up no meeting. Well
walter_white  Well, then insist on it, damn it
walter_white  Act panicked.
walter_white  Gus' ass is on the line.
walter_white  He'll meet with you if he thinks you're a liability.
jesse_pinkman  No. He
jesse_pinkman  He will waste me if he thinks l'm a liability.
jesse_pinkman  You know what?
jesse_pinkman  Whatever, man.
walter_white  a piss. l think you got a phone call.
walter_white  Anything important?
gustavo_fring  Yes?
mike_ehrmantraut  l did some digging around.
gustavo_fring  And?
mike_ehrmantraut  Neither the DEA nor the APD considers you a person of interest.
mike_ehrmantraut  Schrader is looking into you totally on his lonesome. A voice in the wilderness
mike_ehrmantraut  Does
gustavo_fring  Does he have resources?
mike_ehrmantraut  Just him
mike_ehrmantraut  him, his credit card and his chauffeur Walter. He'd be committing career suicide if he were to mention you to Merkert again.
gustavo_fring  No warrant for that tracking device? No
mike_ehrmantraut  The
mike_ehrmantraut  guy has gone totally maverick. He's
mike_ehrmantraut  He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.
mike_ehrmantraut  We watch our backs, we don't throw him any bones.
mike_ehrmantraut  He'll never make a case.
gustavo_fring  What about Chile?
Mike_Ehrmantraut  lf l can't find any trace before '89 l seriously doubt Schrader can
mike_ehrmantraut  Seems to me the bigger problem is the cartel.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, we can handle them if that's all we've got on our plate.
mike_ehrmantraut  But dealing with both Schrader and the Mexicans at the same time?
mike_ehrmantraut  lf he happens to be watching when they make a move it could be the perfect storm.
gustavo_fring  Thank you.
gustavo_fring  l'll be in touch.
unknown  I don't know how many grandmas and grandpas we
unknown  got. ls
unknown  ls there a couple
gustavo_fring  Hello, Hector.
gustavo_fring  The cartel has given me its ultimatum.
gustavo_fring  To which l've said
gustavo_fring  no. DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.
gustavo_fring  He's looking into my past.
gustavo_fring  ls today the day,
max_arciniega  Hector? Gustavo, sit down. You're
max_arciniega  You're making me nervous. lt's a
max_arciniega  good plan.
max_arciniega  Trust yourself
max_arciniega  yourself. Everything
juan_bolsa  is going
juan_bolsa  to be okay. Are you crazy
hector_salamanca  The boss is gonna rip
hector_salamanca  your balls
hector_salamanca  off! What, you gonna tell?
hector_salamanca  And you? They ain't gonna say nothing.
juan_bolsa  They like what they see. You're not going to
hector_salamanca  offer our guests anything? Who says
hector_salamanca  they're guests? lf the boss
juan_bolsa  wants them to drink
juan_bolsa  they drink. Sothe Chicken Brothers.
hector_salamanca  Dark meat and white meat? Don't look
hector_salamanca  like no brothers to me.
eladio_vuente  At last
eladio_vuente  last! The master
eladio_vuente  chefs! You
eladio_vuente  two. That chicken you cook. l swear, it has got
gustavo_fring  to be the tastiest
gustavo_fring  chicken in all of Mexico.
gustavo_fring  Thank
max_arciniega  you, Don Eladio. lt's
max_arciniega  lt's a great honor.
eladio_vuente  Max is the chef. The compliments are all his. Gustavo
eladio_vuente  is too modest.
eladio_vuente  be no
eladio_vuente  restaurant without him. Well, however you
max_arciniega  two do it, keep it up. Your chicken, it's sozesty. Piquant. But it does not taste like
eladio_vuente  a Mexican style. lt's a recipe l learned in Chile which l've modified a bit for the Mexican
eladio_vuente  palate. l bet we like a little more chili than you Chileans. We Mexicans
eladio_vuente  Soif your partner is the chef then who are you?
eladio_vuente  Don't tell me you are just the taster! l handle the business
gustavo_fring  operations. Gustavo is a brilliant businessman. Es el businessman
max_arciniega  businessman. Good, good. But tell me something. That chicken,
