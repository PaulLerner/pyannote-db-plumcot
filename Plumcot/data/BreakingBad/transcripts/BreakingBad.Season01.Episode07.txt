#unknown In closing, I can tell you we take this very seriously.
#unknown APD as well as the DEA.
#unknown Stopping the manufacture and sale of methamphetamines remains one of our highest priorities.
#unknown And the theft of lab equipment from your school is also receiving our highest attention.
#unknown Rest assured, no stone will go unturned in our search for the person or persons responsible for this.
#unknown If you have any questions, now would be the time.
#unknown You're talking like you haven't caught anybody yet.
#unknown What about the janitor that was dealing drugs at the school? There is no indication that this individual was selling drugs.
#unknown He was arrested for having a small amount of marijuana in his car, not in the school.
#unknown And he's since been fired.
#unknown I heard he had a record.
#unknown I'd like to know how he got a job here in the first place.
#unknown Why wasn't there a background check?  There was one.
#unknown We're currently reviewing our hiring policies.
#unknown You better be doing more than that.
#unknown He was arrested in front of my daughter.
#unknown This guy was stealing the lab equipment, right? That's not our thinking at this time.
#unknown We are looking at others who had access, not limited to the maintenance staff.
#unknown Are you saying there was a breakin? Do we know exactly when this happened? I mean, could it have been during school hours? We haven't been able to establish a date or time, but there is no sign of breaking or entering.
#unknown Whoever took it had a key? We're talking inside job? Someone who's still at the school? At this time I'm not able to discuss the details, but what I can tell you is that we have some very good people working very hard on this case.
#unknown I'm sorry, Officer.
#unknown But that sounds like doubletalk.
#unknown We're trying to protect our children.
#unknown You have to level with us.
#unknown Really, we are giving you all the information we have.
#unknown You know what I'd like to see in this school? Drugsniffing dogs.
#unknown Yeah, dogs, and metal detectors, and locker searches, and strip searches.
#unknown Our district has strict policies  I heard about this school in Canada.
#unknown They arrested one of their groundskeepers with drugs.
#unknown And the next day they found out over half of the students were high on LSD.
#unknown LSD? When were you gonna tell us about the LSD? The equipment was taken from our chemistry department.
#unknown And I would like someone to give us some specifics.
#unknown Walt? Yeah.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White is currently on medical leave.
#unknown But as he's chair of the science department, he's made a very special effort to be with us here.
#unknown And I'd like to take a moment to thank him for that.
#unknown Could you please tell us more about the equipment that was taken?  Please.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown And thank you.
#unknown The inventory list for the missing labware is as follows: one 5,000 milliliter round bottom boiling flask, one Kjeldahlstyle recovery flask, two fullface respirators, some sep funnels, a sill head with a thermometer holder Ow, my knee.
#unknown Where did that come from? And why was it so damn good? Because it was illegal.
#unknown "A NoRoughStuffType Deal" Unfinished, of course.
#unknown But just look at all this space.
#unknown You gotta think rec room, media room.
#unknown Just imagine all the things you could do down here.
#unknown Now remember, you're buying for this fantastic neigorhood.
#unknown Big lawns and shade tress.
#unknown Walking distance to the country club.
#unknown What happened there? Bit of a fixer, but this house has great bones.
#unknown You know what? We're zeroing in.
#unknown I've got another listing, brandnew, right around the corner.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown It's by appointment only.
#unknown I'm here to see the owner.
#unknown He's in the recreational vehicle.
#unknown Yo, it's appointment only! How you feeling? About as good as you look.
#unknown Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.
#unknown Listen, I visited you in the hospital, but you were asleep.
#unknown Yeah, Skinny Pete said you wanted Tuco's address.
#unknown Acting like you were all out for blood.
#unknown You are alive, so obviously you wised up.
#unknown No, I did go see him.
#unknown Bullshit.
#unknown Are you selling your house? I got two dudes that turned into raspberry slushie and flushed down my toilet.
#unknown I can't even take a proper dump in there.
#unknown The whole damn house has got to be haunted by now.
#unknown You didn't actually go see Tuco? Here.
#unknown That is seventeenfive.
#unknown Your half of the 35,000.
#unknown Plus there's an extra 15 in there.
#unknown It's all yours.
#unknown You've earned it.
#unknown You got this money from Tuco.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown So Tuco gave you this is what you're saying.
#unknown We made a deal.
#unknown You made a deal?  That's right.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Why would you make a deal with that scumbag? You see what he did to me? Because I think that we can do business together.
#unknown We came to an understanding.
#unknown No way, man! Okay? No understanding.
#unknown Take a look at the money in your hand.
#unknown Now just imagine making that every week.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown Two pounds a week.
#unknown Without even talking to me, you told this insane ass clown deadeyed killer that, uh that we would give him two pounds a week? We'll just scale up our operation.
#unknown We'll add a few more hours  Don't talk to me about hours.
#unknown What about pseudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is just gonna bring it to us? It takes me a week to get this stuff.
#unknown I'm driving all the way out to Las Cruces.
#unknown to meet up with my smurfs  Smurfs?  Dudes who go to the drugstores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell them to me.
#unknown And that's maybe only good for, like, maybe a halfpound worth.
#unknown See, that's the bottleneck in your brilliant business plan.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Of course you would have known that if you would have just asked me.
#unknown Well, here we are again.
#unknown Here we are.
#unknown Skyler, you look great.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You must be, what, six, seven months? How goes it? It's great other than waddling to the bathroom every five minutes.
#unknown The baby shower's next week.
#unknown It'll be good to It'll be good to have a day that's just about Skyler.
#unknown Very nice.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Well, Walt, I see you've committed to the hair loss.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown How do you feel?  Oh, okay.
#unknown You know, pretty decent actually.
#unknown His color is better.
#unknown You know, his energy.
#unknown And he's even more physical.
#unknown More physical? Well sexual.
#unknown Frisky, actually.
#unknown I mean, that's got to be a good sign, right? Sure, I'll take that.
#unknown Right, Walt? Couldn't that mean that the chemo is working? Realistically, it may just mean that we've got the antiemetics tuned right.
#unknown Truth is, until Walt's finished this round of chemo and we look at a new PET scan, we just can't say for sure.
#unknown Isn't there anything else we could be doing? I've been wondering about alternative medicine.
#unknown I mean, Eastern healing.
#unknown You know, holistic.
#unknown Well, I can't speak to its efficacy.
#unknown But as long as it doesn't interfere with our treatment, anything that helps my patient have a better outlook, a better comfort, is fine by me.
#unknown So you're saying it's all psychological.
#unknown It doesn't make any real difference.
#unknown Having a better outlook can make a tremendous difference.
#unknown But it's also important that we manage our expectations.
#unknown What? A junkyard? Let me guess, you picked this place? What's wrong with it? It's private.
#unknown This is like a noncriminal's idea of a drug meet.
#unknown This is like, "Oh, I saw this in a movie.
#unknown Oh, look at me.
#unknown " So where do you transact your business? Enlighten me.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown How about Taco Cabeza? Half the deals I've ever done went down at Taco Cabeza.
#unknown Nice and public.
#unknown Open 24 hours.
#unknown Nobody ever gets shot at Taco Cabeza.
#unknown Hell, why not the mall? You know, wait at the Gap.
#unknown "Hey! It's time for the meet.
#unknown " You know, I'll put down the flatfront khakis, head on over, grab an Orange Julius.
#unknown Skip the part where psycho lunatic Tuco comes and steals my drugs and leaves me bleeding to death.
#unknown Look, you don't have to be here for this.
#unknown Okay? I mean, seriously.
#unknown I'm okay.
#unknown Nah, I'm no pussy.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Clean and his boy.
#unknown I'm sorry that I had to tune you up.
#unknown Respect, ese.
#unknown You gotta give it to get it.
#unknown Hey, what are we doing way the hell out here? What, they close the mall or something? Heisenberg, come on, break it out.
#unknown That's it? That's all you got? We had some production problems.
#unknown Point fivethree.
#unknown I thought you was a player.
#unknown You told me two pounds, and now you waste my time with these Chiclets? minus the half for wasting my time.
#unknown Hey, come on.
#unknown What, you're gonna argue? You got something to say? You're doing business like a couple little bitches.
#unknown I want all of it.
#unknown What did you say? You like this product, and you want more.
#unknown Consider it a capital investment.
#unknown Loco bald motherfucker.
#unknown Vig? Interest.
#unknown Weekly.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown That's $65,625 with interest.
#unknown 1.
#unknown 875 pounds.
#unknown No.
#unknown Next Friday.
#unknown And no production problems.
#unknown Can you handle 4 pounds? Listen, old man.
#unknown Talk is talk.
#unknown But owing me money that's bad.
#unknown What did you just do? wasn't bad enough.
#unknown We're talking 200300 boxes of sinus pills.
#unknown There ain't that many smurfs in the world.
#unknown We're not going to need pseudo ephedrine.
#unknown We're going to make phenylacetone in a tube furnace, then we're gonna use reductive amination to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.
#unknown So no pseudo?  No pseudo.
#unknown So you do have a plan.
#unknown Yeah, Mr.
#unknown White! Yeah, science! Okay.
#unknown What's this?  That is a shopping list.
#unknown Getting some of those items may be challenging.
#unknown "One autotransformer, hy hydrous methyl methylamine, two 35 M&amp;M tube furnaces" That's MM: millimeter.
#unknown One 70millimeter would be fine, but they're hard to come by, so "40 grams thorium nitrate"? Yo, Mr.
#unknown White, I can't even pronounce half this shit.
#unknown You know what? Count me out.
#unknown I'm leaving town.
#unknown I'm moving to, like, Oregon or something Jesse, Jesse, listen to me.
#unknown Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
#unknown What are you doing? This is the first day of the rest of your life, but what kind of life will it be? Will be be a life of fear, of "Oh, no, no, no, "I can't do this," of never once believing in yourself?  I don't know.
#unknown Listen.
#unknown These things? We need them.
#unknown And only you can get them for us.
#unknown Okay, it's ready.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown Hi, baby.
#unknown I'm your Aunt Marie.
#unknown Now, you already know that because when you watch this 20 years from now, I will look exactly the same as I do now.
#unknown I know it is amazing.
#unknown I have aged shockingly well, haven't I? Anyway, welcome to your baby shower, Esmeralda! Esmeralda? Esmeralda.
#unknown That's your name, and you heard it here first.
#unknown Now, that is your wonderful, handsome older brother.
#unknown Show her, older brother, your face.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Not right up the nose.
#unknown Not Back to me.
#unknown There's your mommy! Hello, Mommy! And look! There you are, Esmeralda! Wake up, baby! Time to party! Easy.
#unknown Believe it or not, Esmeralda, right after the party, your name was changed to Holly.
#unknown And I believe, Hank, that that was around the time that we took Aunt Marie to the insane asylum.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown I dropped her off at the curb.
#unknown Then I married Shania Twain and lived happily ever after.
#unknown There's Daddy! Speak, Daddy! Say hello to your daughter.
#unknown Holly, I am very proud of you, and I think about you all the time.
#unknown Wherever you go, whatever you do in life, always know that you have a family who loves you very, very much.
#unknown Cheers.
#unknown Cheers! Oh, my God, it's so cute.
#unknown Oh, Carmen, it's Oh, look.
#unknown Look at that.
#unknown It's adorable.
#unknown I love it, Carmen.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You're so welcome, honey.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Look at the little feet.
#unknown From me.
#unknown And Hank.
#unknown What nice wrapping paper.
#unknown Marie always finds the best wrapping paper.
#unknown I do.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Let's see what this is.
#unknown Exciting.
#unknown Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
#unknown It's a a tiara.
#unknown Marie, is this White gold and several carats' worth of zircons.
#unknown Oh, Marie, you spent too much on this.
#unknown You shouldn't have.
#unknown You really, really shouldn't.
#unknown But it's so It's really It's sparkly.
#unknown Sparkly! Like wow! Thank you.
#unknown Hey, listen, Walt You got anything stronger than beer? It's just gor Oh, it's great.
#unknown I love it.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thank you, sweetie, thank you.
#unknown Sorry, man.
#unknown You know, after 200 presents, it just gets kind of old.
#unknown That's nice stuff.
#unknown It is, isn't it? I got just the thing to go with that.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I wasn't thinking.
#unknown No, no, no, no.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown You mind if I have one? You think it's a good idea? Hank, I've already got lung cancer.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown You got me there.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Cuban.
#unknown I did a little favor for an FBI guy.
#unknown Now, I was under the impression that these were illegal, hmm? Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, doesn't it? It's funny, isn't it? How we draw that line.
#unknown Yeah? What line is that? Well, what's legal, what's illegal, Cuban cigars, alcohol.
#unknown You know, if we were drinking this in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.
#unknown Another year, we'd be okay.
#unknown Who knows what will be legal next year? You mean like pot? Yeah.
#unknown Like pot.
#unknown Or whatever.
#unknown Cocaine? Heroin? I'm just saying it's arbitrary.
#unknown Well, you ought to visit lockup.
#unknown You hear a lot of guys talking like that.
#unknown "Hey, man, why'd you bust me with these 14 bales of ganja? "It's all gonna be legal next year when Willie Nelson's president.
#unknown " Shit, buddy, it doesn't only go one way, either.
#unknown Sometimes there's stuff that's legal that shouldn't be.
#unknown I mean, friggin' meth used to be legal.
#unknown Used to sell it over every counter at every pharmacy across America.
#unknown Thank God they came to their senses on that one, huh? Yeah.
#unknown Nice party.
#unknown A tiara.
#unknown A white gold tiara for a newborn baby.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You know, I think she got that at Gertrude Zachary's in Nob Hill.
#unknown I mean, that thing must have cost, like, what, $500 or $600.
#unknown You know what? I think I'm going to return it.
#unknown You sure? She's bound to find out.
#unknown Well, maybe I can explain to her that we need a Diaper Genie more than a white gold baby tiara.
#unknown You know, I've been thinking about what you said to Dr.
#unknown Delcavoli about alternative medicine.
#unknown Don't worry.
#unknown I'm not going to mention that anymore.
#unknown What I mean is that maybe there is something to it.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Look.
#unknown They do this Navajo sweat lodge up by Farmington.
#unknown Healing ceremony.
#unknown It's supposed to be good for your lungs.
#unknown I'm not saying that I believe in it, but you know, it might be an experience.
#unknown Really? You? In a sweat lodge? I was thinking about driving up on Friday, coming back Sunday.
#unknown I mean, if you're okay with it.
#unknown Well, of course I'm okay with that.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Sweat lodge?  Yeah.
#unknown I'm already sweating.
#unknown Help me out.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Excellent.
#unknown This is excellent.
#unknown Very good work.
#unknown Damn straight.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hydrogen.
#unknown Electrolytically produced, yes? Yeah, like you asked.
#unknown I mean, this crap wasn't easy to get.
#unknown It was expensive.
#unknown Methylamine.
#unknown Where's the methylamine? I don't see the methylamine.
#unknown Yeah, well, that's where I ran into some trouble.
#unknown What kind of trouble? Well, half this crap I could just buy, right? But this methylamine not so easy.
#unknown They got it locked down tight.
#unknown But I did find some pros who will rip it off for us.
#unknown But they want 10 grand.
#unknown So what's the problem? You have the money.
#unknown No, had.
#unknown I already spent almost the whole wad.
#unknown I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
#unknown I told you, all this crap was expensive.
#unknown So these thieves, did they say where they would be stealing it from? Yeah, a chemical supply place south of town.
#unknown They got guards and security cameras, big ass steel doors.
#unknown That's why these dudes are charging so much.
#unknown What? So why don't we just steal it ourselves? Yeah? How are we going to do that? With this.
#unknown So what's this stuff called again? Thermite.
#unknown And that will cut through a lock? Because this is supposed to be one big ass lock.
#unknown In World War II, the Germans had an artillery piece, it's the biggest in the world, called the Gustav Gun, and it weighed a thousand tons.
#unknown And the Gustav was capable of firing a 7ton shell and hitting a target accurately 23 miles away.
#unknown I mean, you could drop bombs on it every day for a month without ever disabling it.
#unknown But you drop a commando, one man, with just a bag of this and he could melt right through and destroy that gun forever.
#unknown Jeez! So yes.
#unknown I think it will cut through any lock we're likely to find.
#unknown You'd like to return this? It's very nice, but yes.
#unknown Well, it is from the store, isn't it? Oh, yes.
#unknown It's from this store.
#unknown Do you happen to have a receipt? No.
#unknown I don't.
#unknown It was a gift.
#unknown A gift.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Wilson, could you step over here, please? Mr.
#unknown Wilson, I'd like you to watch this lady while I phone the police.
#unknown Excuse me? Ma'am, this item is stolen, as I'm sure you know.
#unknown Come with me, please.
#unknown Oh, yes.
#unknown I intend to press charges.
#unknown Please do.
#unknown We'll be here.
#unknown Look, I I've never stolen anything in my life, all right? I told you.
#unknown That tiara was a gift.
#unknown A baby shower gift.
#unknown So who gave it to you, then?  I don't think I have to tell you that.
#unknown You don't have to tell me anything.
#unknown You can talk to the police, and I can tell them how my daughterinlaw remembers showing this particular item to a tall blonde woman who, when her back was turned, walked right out the door with it.
#unknown So there.
#unknown Oh, yeah? Then I can talk to the Channel 3 News.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I can tell them how you people, without a shred, without a modicum of evidence, illegally detained an innocent pregnant woman in a dank storeroom.
#unknown This is my office.
#unknown I feel I'm being held hostage.
#unknown Furthermore, I'm not getting enough air back here.
#unknown I don't think I can breathe.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Oh, no.
#unknown I'm going into labor.
#unknown Yes, I Hi.
#unknown You've reached Marie.
#unknown Do the beep thing.
#unknown Marie? It's Skyler.
#unknown I just left Zachary's.
#unknown I need to talk to you immediately.
#unknown Where's the guard? He's supposed to be coming by.
#unknown You think he already passed?  I don't know.
#unknown There he is.
#unknown Yeah, I see him.
#unknown Wait till he passes.
#unknown Okay, it's clear.
#unknown What the hell is this?  It's all they had.
#unknown Then you go to another store.
#unknown If this is all they had, wrong place.
#unknown Just put it on.
#unknown Of course you can Okay.
#unknown This is it.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown Dawm.
#unknown Where Duck.
#unknown Duck.
#unknown What? He's not supposed to come back.
#unknown What's he doing? Oh, God.
#unknown He's going to the crapper.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown Carry your bag.
#unknown What? What are you doing? Okay, there is it.
#unknown Is this going to be loud? We'll find out in about ten seconds.
#unknown Stand back.
#unknown Jesus! What's going on?  Where are the gallon jugs?  I don't know.
#unknown God!  What? Let's just take this.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown What the hell are you doing opening the door? How are we going to take this thing out?  How is it going to be any different?  Can I just try it?  Fine, fine, go ahead.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Yeah, baby.
#unknown See? Eat it, okay? I'm the king.
#unknown I'm the king.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown That didn't sound good.
#unknown Well, this thing's not going anywhere.
#unknown We're not cooking in my damn driveway.
#unknown I tell you that.
#unknown What part of slow it down did you not understand? You talk too much.
#unknown It's heavy, man.
#unknown You got to wait for me.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown That's good, that's good.
#unknown Now just bring it up.
#unknown Easy, easy, easy.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Your real estate agent, when is she supposed to come back? Shit.
#unknown Yo, I don't know.
#unknown I'll make damn sure she doesn't.
#unknown Good call, yo.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Keep the temperature steady at 425 degrees.
#unknown We'll need to run it two more hours to have enough to make 4½ pounds.
#unknown $44,000 ahead each.
#unknown Right on, man.
#unknown Right on.
#unknown With the amount of methylamine that we got last night, we could make well, for the foreseeable future.
#unknown How long is that going to be? I mean in your situation.
#unknown How much cash do you need? More.
#unknown Someone's in my yard.
#unknown Was there, by any chance, scheduled for this afternoon an open house? I left them a message, man.
#unknown It's not my fault.
#unknown I don't care how you do it.
#unknown Just keep them out of here.
#unknown Do you understand?  Yeah.
#unknown Go.
#unknown You know you can't duck me forever.
#unknown What? Come on.
#unknown I left you, like, 15 messages.
#unknown When I went to your office, you snuck out the back way.
#unknown I didn't sneak.
#unknown I was going to lunch.
#unknown Jeez, Skyler, what are you, the paranoid police? Marie, I have never been so humiliated in my life.
#unknown That tiara.
#unknown They accused me at Zachary's of shoplifting it.
#unknown What were you doing at Zachary's? I was returning it.
#unknown You were returning it.
#unknown Why would you return it? It just wasn't Marie, what is wrong with you? Can you please tell me that? Can you tell me why you'd do such a thing? What does that mean? Does that mean you don't know? That means that I have no idea what the hell you're even talking about.
#unknown You have no idea what I'm talking about.
#unknown The shop The shoplifting.
#unknown No idea? You're not going to admit this, are you? I can't really admit to something when I have no knowledge of what it is that I'm admitting.
#unknown Don't forget to sign in.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown I'd just like to see the basement.
#unknown Yeah, well, it's occupied.
#unknown It's not a bathroom.
#unknown I just want to see the basement.
#unknown What's the big deal? Yo, you ain't seeing the basement, bitch.
#unknown You got that? Is that sinking in? Now beat it.
#unknown All of you all.
#unknown House is not for sale.
#unknown Get the hell out! So how was it? Was it a an experience? Yeah.
#unknown It was definitely an experience.
#unknown What's that smell? Yeah.
#unknown It's sacred Navajo herbs and Hey, is everything okay? No.
#unknown Not really.
#unknown Actually, not at all.
#unknown You know that tiara that Marie gave us? Yeah.
#unknown Well, she stole it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I practically got arrested trying to return it at the store.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown She refuses to admit it.
#unknown She refuses to apologize.
#unknown I don't know what to do.
#unknown Oh, well.
#unknown People sometimes do things for their families.
#unknown People sometimes do things for their families? And, what, that justifies stealing? Yeah.
#unknown That must have been some sweat lodge.
#unknown Have you been listening to the words coming out of your mouth? What would you do if it were me? What do you mean if it were you? If it were me, what would you do? Would you divorce me? Would you turn me in to the police? You don't want to find out.
#unknown Do you want something to eat? No, thanks.
#unknown What is this shit? This is blue.
#unknown We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure.
#unknown It may be blue, but it's the bomb.
#unknown Tight! Tight, tight, yeah! Blue, yellow, pink.
#unknown Whatever, man.
#unknown Just keep bringing me that.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown And what did I say, man? This guy can cook! You're all right, man.
#unknown You're all right.
#unknown We're going to make a lot of money together.
#unknown Just remember who you're working for.
#unknown What did you say? I'm just saying they got to know that they're working for you.
#unknown Like they don't already know that? Are you saying that they're stupid? No, I'm just I'm just saying.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown So you're not saying that they're stupid.
#unknown So I don't understand.
#unknown Are you saying that I'm stupid? No.
#unknown Come on, Tuco.
#unknown I'm just saying.
#unknown No, you're just speaking for me! Like I ain't got the damn sense to speak for myself! Is that it? Is that what you're doing? Tuco.
#unknown Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh? Heisenberg says relax.
#unknown Orale, homes.
#unknown I'm relaxed.
#unknown I'm relaxed.
#unknown I'm relaxed.
#unknown Damn, man! Look at that! Look! Yeah.
#unknown That's messed up.
#unknown Okay, Heisenberg! Next week.
#unknown
