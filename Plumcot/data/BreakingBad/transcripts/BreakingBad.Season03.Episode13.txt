#unknown [knock on door] Well, hello again.
#unknown [Skyler] Hi! I hope we're not too late.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Perfect timing.
#unknown Okay, Stan, this is my husband Walt.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Good to meet you, Walt.
#unknown Nice to meet you.
#unknown Sandia Laboratories, huh? Yeah.
#unknown I hear some pretty fascinating stuff goes on out there.
#unknown Ah, well, you know [both chuckle] Working on anything you can talk about? [groans] I'm picturing giant space lasers.
#unknown Am I right? Honestly, what I do would bore you senseless.
#unknown Oh! But giant space lasers? Now, that sounds cool.
#unknown I'll have to bring it up at our next staff meeting.
#unknown Well, just remember I get a cut.
#unknown [chuckles] All right, that's a deal.
#unknown So this is it, honey.
#unknown What do you say? Do you want to take a tour? Sure.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Look, how about I give y'all some privacy? I'll go out to the car and make a few calls.
#unknown Take as much time as you need.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown He's actually a nice guy.
#unknown He doesn't push.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown So, as you can see, there's, uh there's a kind of flow going on here.
#unknown It's a nice big living room.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown And this is the dining area.
#unknown Ah, the dining area.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Oh, and, uh [singsong] It's got a pool.
#unknown Oh, pool is nice.
#unknown Mmhmm.
#unknown Backyard could be a little bigger.
#unknown Um, and Oh, there's a breakfast bar kind of dealie here which is nice.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown And, uh, I don't know, the kitchen's really spacious and, you know, got good appliances, and How many bedrooms? Three.
#unknown Told you.
#unknown There'll all pretty good size, and Oh, this is the first one here.
#unknown And then there's two more at the back.
#unknown Only three bedrooms? I think we're gonna need at least five.
#unknown Don't you think? Five? Yeah.
#unknown What? Do I look like I'm about to drop a litter? No, no, no, no, no, no.
#unknown Dude.
#unknown No, we'll have three kids total, eventually.
#unknown But we'll need a spare room for a study so that I could work at home and you can write.
#unknown Nah, I don't I don't think this is gonna be enough.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Um, what about a wine cellar? I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar.
#unknown Very funny.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown I just think we need to set our sights high is all.
#unknown At least higher than here.
#unknown Walt, this is a good neighborhood.
#unknown It's got a good elementary and supposedly a very good high school.
#unknown And believe me 'cause I have definitely looked everywhere for our price range, this is as good as it gets.
#unknown Well, then let's stretch our price range.
#unknown [scoffs] Truly.
#unknown I mean, why buy a starter house when we'll have to move out in a year or two? Did you win the lottery and not tell me? I'm serious.
#unknown [chuckles] Come on.
#unknown Why be cautious? We've got nowhere to go but up.
#unknown [exhales] [sighs] [ringtone] Yeah.
#unknown [Man] Walter, you see us? Yeah, I see you.
#unknown I'd like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us.
#unknown And then what? I'm gonna need some some kind of assurance.
#unknown I assure you I could kill you from way over here, if it makes you feel any better.
#unknown ["door open" bell dinging] Walter, you've been busy.
#unknown You want to put your arms out to the sides for me, if you would? You know I haven't slept since Thursday? I was out all night cleaning up after you.
#unknown I need my sleep.
#unknown You said no half measures.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Funny how words can be so open to interpretation.
#unknown You get your car fixed? Not yet.
#unknown You're gonna want to get your car fixed.
#unknown Let's see how this goes first.
#unknown Has your condition worsened? Excuse me? Your medical condition, has it grown worse? Not that I know of, no.
#unknown Is there a ringing in your ears? No.
#unknown Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices? I'm quite well, thank you.
#unknown No.
#unknown Clearly you are not.
#unknown No rational person would do as you have done.
#unknown Explain yourself.
#unknown My partner was about to get himself shot.
#unknown I intervened.
#unknown Some worthless junkie For him you intervene and put us all at risk? Some contemptible junkie who couldn't keep the peace for eight hours? That's right.
#unknown He couldn't.
#unknown He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an 11yearold boy.
#unknown I heard about it.
#unknown He should have let me take care of them.
#unknown Maybe.
#unknown Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.
#unknown Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child? I would never ask you that.
#unknown Where is Pinkman now? I wouldn't know.
#unknown A couple of time zones away, at least.
#unknown Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.
#unknown He has enough money to last forever.
#unknown He knows he needs to keep moving.
#unknown You'll never find him.
#unknown I don't know, Walt.
#unknown It's what I do, after all.
#unknown He's out of the picture.
#unknown I saved his life.
#unknown I owed him that.
#unknown But now he and I are done, which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it? [inhales] [exhales] You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man, so if I may, I would like to review options with you of which it seems to me you have two.
#unknown Option A you kill me right here and now.
#unknown Apparently, I have made that very easy for you.
#unknown You can kill me no witnesses and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman, and you kill him too.
#unknown A pointless exercise, it seems to me.
#unknown But that is Option A.
#unknown What is Option B? I continue cooking.
#unknown You and I both forget about Pinkman.
#unknown We forget this ever happened.
#unknown We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement.
#unknown I prefer Option B.
#unknown You'd need a new assistant.
#unknown I could get right on that.
#unknown No.
#unknown This time, I choose.
#unknown Your car.
#unknown Get it fixed.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown [handle rattling, keys jingle] Really? It's good to see you.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown It's good to be back.
#unknown Well, shall we? By all means, Gale, let's cook.
#unknown [Mike] What about that rhinoceros? You think he'd make a good pet? No.
#unknown No? Don't you think if you called to him, he'd come running for his supper? I'll bet he would.
#unknown I bet he'd come running.
#unknown [vocalizes] You're silly, Pop Pop.
#unknown Well, a little.
#unknown But he'd probably knock everything over.
#unknown Plus, there's that big nose of his.
#unknown That's not a nose.
#unknown That's a horn.
#unknown Is that so? His real nose is little.
#unknown Huh.
#unknown I learn all kinds of things being with you.
#unknown Okay, June Bug, these are for you.
#unknown What about the rest? The rest are for me.
#unknown No, they're not.
#unknown You're too old for balloons.
#unknown Oh, you're never too old for balloons.
#unknown Give me a hug.
#unknown Oh, I see your mama.
#unknown Don't keep her waiting.
#unknown Bye, Pop Pop.
#unknown Bye, baby.
#unknown [electricity crackles] [speaks Spanish] [speaks Spanish] [speaking Spanish] [silenced gunshots] [gasp] [speaks Mandarin] Please.
#unknown Please, no.
#unknown [speaking Mandarin] [screaming] Chow, do you have anything you want to tell me? Thank God you're here.
#unknown They keep me prisoner.
#unknown They keep you prisoner.
#unknown I don't do nothing for them ever.
#unknown They try and make me.
#unknown I say no.
#unknown They steal my chemicals.
#unknown I can't stop them.
#unknown I am businessman.
#unknown You're a businessman The lady out front Hey, lady, are you still there? Ask her if she's still there.
#unknown [speaks Mandarin] [Woman speaking Mandarin] [speaking continues] She says yes.
#unknown [sighs] How's her driving? Driving.
#unknown Is she good behind the wheel? Good.
#unknown She's good driver.
#unknown Licensed? Dependable? She has a Camry.
#unknown Good.
#unknown [grunts] [whimpering] The trucks will be here first thing in the morning.
#unknown I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time.
#unknown So have her drive you to the hospital.
#unknown [whimpering] She's gonna need her shoe.
#unknown Where did they cross? Laredo, looks like.
#unknown They didn't exactly send their A players.
#unknown But like you said, it's cartel, all right.
#unknown Probing for weakness.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Well, they didn't find any.
#unknown What about Pinkman? [sighs] I'm making inquiries.
#unknown [door closes] [liquid bubbling] Done.
#unknown That's two? All right.
#unknown Let's close it up.
#unknown Bring it down.
#unknown Ready? [switch clicks] [machinery whirs] Great.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown We're good.
#unknown You can take your mask off now.
#unknown [clatter] [Gale] Does that guy ever leave? Nah.
#unknown When exactly did that start? It's new.
#unknown We had a We had a little drama with the person you replaced.
#unknown I'm sorry to hear that.
#unknown No, it'll be fine.
#unknown Things will continue to smooth out, and, yeah, it'll be fine.
#unknown By the way, if you're at all worried about working with me Mo, I'm not.
#unknown Because whatever my shortcomings last time, I intend for things to go perfectly from here on out.
#unknown So, if there is Gale, you're great.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown I just However you like things to be done is exactly how we are gonna do them.
#unknown Period.
#unknown From here on out.
#unknown So, uh please teach me.
#unknown [chuckles] Okay.
#unknown ["Crapa Pelada"] [singing along with recording]  A voi, miei signori   Io voglio narrare   La storia che tanto mi fa disperare   Con ciocche sebenti che vedo cadere   Dal capo i capelli bianchi   Ormai son pelato, deluso, avvilito   Non so quali cure adottar   Ma senti cosa dice   Quel povero infelice   Non ti lamentar   Ma prova a cantar   Con noi questa canzon   [tempo increases]  Crapa Pelada la fÃ  i turtei   Ghe ne dÃ  minga ai sui fradei   Oh, oh, oh, oh   I s fradei fan la fritada   Ghe ne dan minga a Crapa Pelada   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Crapa Pelada la fÃ  i turtei   Ghe ne dÃ  minga ai s fradei   I s fradei fan la fritada   Ghe ne dan minga a Crapa Pelada   Crapa Pelada la fÃ  i turtei   Ghe ne dÃ  minga ai s fradei   Oh, oh, oh, oh  [knock on door]  [continues] [knocking continues] [stereo off] Gale.
#unknown It's good to see you.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Fring.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown This is, uh I should have called first.
#unknown I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No.
#unknown No, not at all.
#unknown Please come in.
#unknown Can I offer you something? CrÃ¨me de Menthe? Oh, no.
#unknown No, thank you.
#unknown I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
#unknown Oh, no, no.
#unknown It's no inconvenience.
#unknown I need to talk to you about something something rather pressing.
#unknown If push came to shove, I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself.
#unknown You and an assistant.
#unknown Why would Why would push come to shove? Has Walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of work? Uh I guess I assumed it was because it pays so well.
#unknown Oh, it is, but specifically.
#unknown Has he ever spoken to you about his health problems? Oh.
#unknown I'm not surprised.
#unknown He's a very private person.
#unknown What exactly are his health problems? He's dying of cancer.
#unknown It is why he does this, to provide for his family, which he has accomplished.
#unknown They will never want for anything.
#unknown He's seen to that.
#unknown Well how long does he have? That is very much the question.
#unknown He does not want to talk about it, and every time I bring it up with him Hmm.
#unknown I don't know that he's fully accepted the reality of it.
#unknown And not to sound coldblooded, but I am running a business here.
#unknown No, I I understand.
#unknown I have a very large investment in this.
#unknown There is so much overhead that I can't afford to shut down, not even for a week.
#unknown So you understand my concern and my desire for continuity? I do, absolutely.
#unknown Now, I intend to keep Walter on as long as he wants, assuming he's physically up to it.
#unknown But as he cannot or will not tell me how long that might be, I must prepare for the worstcase scenario.
#unknown The worstcase scenario.
#unknown Uh I suppose if we had at least a few more cooks together You don't think you're ready now? Well, he is such a a master.
#unknown There's always more for me to learn.
#unknown But I'm thinking that if we had say, one or two more cooks? One more I guess, would do it.
#unknown I suppose.
#unknown I believe in you, Gale.
#unknown I know that when the time comes, you will be ready.
#unknown What's up? Walt? Hmm.
#unknown Is there, um any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed? No, it's pretty straightforward.
#unknown I'll show you when we get there.
#unknown [sighs] [beeps] Yeah.
#unknown Tell him I'm in conference.
#unknown [beeps] Can't you see I'm in conference? I'm looking to find a client of yours.
#unknown I was hoping you could help me out with an address.
#unknown Which client? Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Jesse Pinkman in the phone book Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown How would one track him down? I wonder.
#unknown [switch clicks] You're still here.
#unknown I need your full attention, Saul.
#unknown Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts.
#unknown The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to whatever the hell this is exactly.
#unknown What am I, eightgrade hall monitor? "Current whereabouts.
#unknown " Let me tell you something, Mike Whoa.
#unknown You are good right there.
#unknown Now, let's both get comfortable.
#unknown Now, when I say I'm looking for Pinkman, we both know why, don't we? And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me.
#unknown [stammering] Mike, uh, there are rules to this lawyer thing.
#unknown Is that right? [laughs] Yeah.
#unknown Attorneyclient privilege.
#unknown That's a big one.
#unknown And that's something I provide for you.
#unknown So if I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking "Old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy.
#unknown What's to keep him from giving me up?" You see? So then where's the trust? I trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in.
#unknown Yeah, it's an argument.
#unknown So don't make me beat you till your legs don't work.
#unknown Now tell me where to find him.
#unknown You know it's the right thing.
#unknown I can't tell you, Mike.
#unknown All right, I Look, if I was to tell you, I just I couldn't live with myself.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown [gasps] But who's to say I didn't write the address down in my day planner? Or on a scratch piece of paper somewhere? Who's to say I didn't write down a location strictly for my own professional use? Do not touch anything on my desk.
#unknown I'm gonna leave the room, make myself a NescafÃ©.
#unknown [door opens] [door closes] I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
#unknown Like a mother hen.
#unknown [chuckles] Believe me, money laundering ain't what it used to be.
#unknown God, do I miss the '80s.
#unknown Wasting your time.
#unknown I'm buying the car wash.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown Well, one look at this place, you're gonna fall in love, so [coughs] Huh? Was I right? Where else are you gonna find a cashonly business that's this much fun? Unless we're talking massage parlors, and I don't see it.
#unknown Shall we? You ever actually play laser tag? It's good cardio.
#unknown Plus you get to shoot at kids.
#unknown [chuckles] [games beeping] You got your bumper cars over there down that way.
#unknown Got your arcade right here.
#unknown All the latest video games.
#unknown Snack bar is over there.
#unknown Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents.
#unknown That's a whole new revenue stream.
#unknown All right, enough.
#unknown We're good.
#unknown [chuckles] Holy Christ.
#unknown We're good? This constitutes good where you're from? My car is bugged.
#unknown I said maybe maybe I'm being followed.
#unknown What the hell have you gotten me into? My very own P.
#unknown I.
#unknown is threatening to break my legs.
#unknown That's like Thomas Magnum threatening that little prissy guy with the mustache.
#unknown Over and above.
#unknown Servicewise, is is over and above.
#unknown You and I survive this, oh, I'm seriously rethinking my pricing.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown And that goes double for you, HipHop.
#unknown My guy's no dummy.
#unknown Right? So I give us maybe 24 hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere.
#unknown You guys do your thing.
#unknown Make it snappy.
#unknown I'll go see if they have Tetris or something.
#unknown How are you holding up? [groans] You? I got my old job back.
#unknown At least until they kill me and Gale takes over.
#unknown He's their boy, huh? He's their boy.
#unknown How long you think you've got? Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process.
#unknown I try to be as vague as possible, but I got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say.
#unknown Maybe the only thing that's saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.
#unknown Once he feels confident that he knows my entire method So what do we do? You know what we do.
#unknown There's got to be some other way.
#unknown Maybe it's better for you to just go to the cops.
#unknown All right? I mean, I can't believe I'm saying that at all, but for your family? The DEA would love you.
#unknown All the shit you could tell them? Federal Witness Protection, that's a good deal.
#unknown As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
#unknown I mean I'll make it.
#unknown We had a We had a good run.
#unknown But it's over.
#unknown Never the DEA.
#unknown The cook can't stop.
#unknown That's the one thing I'm certain of.
#unknown Production cannot stop.
#unknown Gus can't afford to.
#unknown So if I'm the only chemist that he's got, then I've got leverage.
#unknown And leverage keeps me alive.
#unknown It keeps you alive, too.
#unknown I think I can see to that.
#unknown If I'm the only chemist that he's got.
#unknown I I can't do it, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Like you said, I'm I'm not a I can't do it.
#unknown I'll do it.
#unknown I'm gonna I'm gonna need your help.
#unknown I mean, they're watching me day and night.
#unknown They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment.
#unknown Hell, I don't even know where the man lives.
#unknown He's not in the phone book.
#unknown I can't find him on the Internet.
#unknown I can't do it in the lab.
#unknown Victor's always there.
#unknown But if I could just shake Victor for even an hour one night, I think then that I may be able to make it look like an accident.
#unknown There's got to be some other way.
#unknown I'm all ears.
#unknown But when it comes down to you and me versus him I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry but it's gonna be him.
#unknown You are the only edge that I've got, as long as they don't know that you're in town.
#unknown But I need you to track him.
#unknown Get me his address, and I'll do the rest.
#unknown Look, I saved your life, Jesse.
#unknown Are you gonna save mine? [Jesse] Yeah.
#unknown Please tell me you found him.
#unknown 6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard, Apartment 6.
#unknown You there? Uh, yeah.
#unknown Number 6.
#unknown Got it.
#unknown He's home? Yep.
#unknown Anyone watching the place? No.
#unknown Looks pretty much wide open.
#unknown When are you gonna do it? Tonight.
#unknown Once it gets dark.
#unknown [sighs] Don't do this, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Go to the cops.
#unknown [door opens] [door closes] [vehicle approaching] We got a problem.
#unknown Some kind of chemical leaking in your lab.
#unknown You gotta come with me.
#unknown I'll, uh I'll follow you.
#unknown They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
#unknown Come on, get in the car.
#unknown [motor whirring] [machine whirring in distance] [whirring stops] I don't know if it's a barrel leak or what, but you got something mighty stinky down there.
#unknown After you.
#unknown Walter, the sooner you figure out what this is, the sooner we all go home.
#unknown Please don't do this.
#unknown Mike you don't have to do this.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Unfortunately, I do, Walter.
#unknown Downstairs.
#unknown I'll cook I'll cook for free.
#unknown And there won't be any more trouble.
#unknown I promise you.
#unknown Okay, if I could just talk to Gus, I know I can make him understand.
#unknown If I can talk to Gus No.
#unknown Walter? I can convince him, okay? Just let me, please Please.
#unknown Please let me talk to him! Shut up! Shut up.
#unknown I can't do it.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Okay? Like you said, he's the problem.
#unknown He's always been the problem.
#unknown Without him, we would And he's he's in town, all right? He's not in Virginia or wherever the hell you're looking for him.
#unknown He's right here in Albuquerque, and I can take you to him.
#unknown I'll take you right to him.
#unknown Huh? What do you say? Where is he? Right now.
#unknown You give me an address.
#unknown I I don't He moves.
#unknown He moves around, but if you let me call him No, no, please.
#unknown No, I just My phone.
#unknown I'll just It's just my phone.
#unknown I'll call him, and I'll have him meet me.
#unknown All right? Okay? Okay? [lighter clicking] [cell phone buzzing] Did you do it? Mr.
#unknown White? Did you do it? No, I didn't do it.
#unknown I can't now.
#unknown It's gonna have to be you.
#unknown What? No way, man.
#unknown Listen to me.
#unknown You're closer than we are.
#unknown You'll have about a 20minute lead.
#unknown They've got me at the laundry, and they're going to kill me.
#unknown Jesse, do it now! Do it Do it fast! Do it now! Jesse! Oh, my God.
#unknown Huh.
#unknown Just what the hell was that exactly? You might want to hold off.
#unknown Yeah? Why? Because your boss is gonna need me.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown [dialing] [kettle whistling]  [exotic on stereo] [whistling continues]  [continues] [knocking on door] [buzzing]  [stops] Hi.
#unknown How can I help you? [stammering] Take whatever you want.
