walter_white  Ah, well, you know both
stan  Working on anything you can talk about?
stan  groans I'm picturing giant space lasers.
stan  Am I right?
walter_white  Honestly, what I do would bore you senseless. Oh
walter_white  giant space lasers?
walter_white  Now, that sounds cool.
Walter_White  have to bring it up at our next staff meeting.
stan  Well, just remember I get a cut.
walter_white  chuckles All right,

stan  Take as much time as you need.
skyler_white  All right. Good
skyler_white  actually a nice guy.
skyler_white  He doesn't push.
walter_white  Yeah
skyler_white  So, as you can see, there's, uh there's a kind of flow going on here.
skyler_white  It's a nice big living room.
walter_white  Yeah.
skyler_white  And this is the dining area.
walter_white  Ah, the dining area. Right
walter_white  Right. Yes
skyler_white  Yes.
skyler_white  and, uh singsong It's got a pool. Oh
walter_white  pool is nice. Mmhmm.
walter_white  Backyard could be a little bigger.
skyler_white  and Oh, there's a breakfast bar kind of dealie here which is nice.
skyler_white  And, uh, I don't know, the kitchen's really spacious and, you know, got good appliances,
walter_white  How many bedrooms?
skyler_white  Three.
skyler_white  Told you.
Skyler_White  There'll all pretty good size, and Oh, this is the first one here.
skyler_white  And then there's two more at the back
walter_white  Only three bedrooms?
walter_white  we're gonna need at least five. Don't you think? Five? Yeah
walter_white  What
skyler_white  What? Do I look like I'm about to drop a litter?
walter_white  No, no, no, no, no
walter_white  no. Dude. No, we'll have three kids total, eventually.
walter_white  But we'll need a spare room for a study so that I could work at home and you can write.
walter_white  I don't
walter_white  I don't think this is gonna be enough.
skyler_white  Okay. Um, what about a wine cellar?
skyler_white  I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar.
walter_white  Very funny.
walter_white  I just think we need to set our sights high is all.
walter_white  At least higher than here.
skyler_white  Walt, this is a good neighborhood.
skyler_white  It's got a good elementary and supposedly a very good high school. And believe me 'cause I have definitely looked everywhere
skyler_white  for our price range, this is as good as it gets. Well
walter_white  Well, then let's stretch our price range.
walter_white  Truly. I
walter_white  I mean,
walter_white  why buy a starter house when we'll have to move out in a year or two?
skyler_white  Did you win the lottery and not tell me?
walter_white  I'm serious.
walter_white  Come on.
walter_white  Why be cautious
walter_white  We've got nowhere to go but up
walter_white  Yeah, I
walter_white  I see you
mike_ehrmantraut  like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us.
walter_white  And then what?
walter_white  I'm gonna need some
walter_white  some kind of assurance.
mike_ehrmantraut  Walter, you've been busy.
mike_ehrmantraut  You want to put your arms out to the sides for me, if you would?
mike_ehrmantraut  You know I haven't slept since Thursday?
mike_ehrmantraut  I was out all night cleaning up after you.
mike_ehrmantraut  I need my sleep.
walter_white  You said no half measures.
mike_ehrmantraut  Yeah.
mike_ehrmantraut  Funny how words can be so open to interpretation.
mike_ehrmantraut  You get your car fixed?
mike_ehrmantraut  You're gonna want to get your car fixed.
walter_white  see how this goes first.
gustavo_fring  Has your condition worsened?
walter_white  Excuse me?
gustavo_fring  Your medical condition, has it
gustavo_fring  it grown worse?
walter_white  that I know of,
gustavo_fring  Is there a ringing in your ears? No
gustavo_fring  Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices?
walter_white  I'm quite well, thank you.
gustavo_fring  No
gustavo_fring  Clearly you are not.
gustavo_fring  No rational person would do as you have done.
gustavo_fring  Explain yourself.
walter_white  My partner was about to get himself shot.
walter_white  I intervened.
gustavo_fring  Some worthless junkie
gustavo_fring  For him you intervene and put us all at risk?
gustavo_fring  Some contemptible junkie who couldn't keep the peace for eight hours?
walter_white  That's right.
walter_white  He couldn't.
walter_white  He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an 11yearold boy.
gustavo_fring  I heard about it
gustavo_fring  He should have let me take care of them
walter_white  Maybe.
walter_white  Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.
gustavo_fring  Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child?
walter_white  I would never ask you that.
gustavo_fring  Where is Pinkman now?
walter_white  I wouldn't know
walter_white  A couple of time zones away, at least.
walter_white  Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.
walter_white  He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep moving.
walter_white  You'll never find him
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't know, Walt. It's what I do, after all.
walter_white  He's out of the picture.
walter_white  I saved his life. I owed him that. But now he and I are done,
walter_white  which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it?
walter_white  You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man,
walter_white  so if I may, I would like to review options with you
walter_white  of which it seems to me you have two.
walter_white  Option A
walter_white  you kill me right here and now.
walter_white  Apparently, I have made that very easy for you.
walter_white  You can kill me no witnesses and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman, and you kill him too.
walter_white  pointless exercise, it seems to me. But that is Option A.
gustavo_fring  What is Option B?
walter_white  I continue cooking.
walter_white  You and I both forget about Pinkman.
walter_white  We forget this ever happened.
walter_white  We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement.
walter_white  I prefer Option B.
gustavo_fring  You'd need a new assistant.
walter_white  I could get right on that.
gustavo_fring  No.
gustavo_fring  This time, I choose.
mike_ehrmantraut  Your car. Get it fixed.
walter_white  Yeah.
walter_white  It's good to see you.
gale_boetticher  good to be back.
gale_boetticher  Well, shall we?
walter_white  By all means, Gale, let's cook.
mike_ehrmantraut  Mike What about that rhinoceros? You think he'd make a good pet? No
kaylee_ehrmantraut  No. No
mike_ehrmantraut  No? Don't
mike_ehrmantraut  you think if you called to him, he'd come running for his supper?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'll bet he would.
mike_ehrmantraut  I bet he'd come running.
kaylee_ehrmantraut  You're silly, Pop Pop.
mike_ehrmantraut  Well, a little.
mike_ehrmantraut  But he'd probably knock everything over.
mike_ehrmantraut  Plus, there's that big nose of his.
kaylee_ehrmantraut  That's not a nose. That's a horn.
mike_ehrmantraut  Is that so?
kaylee_ehrmantraut  His real nose is little.
mike_ehrmantraut  I learn all kinds of things being with you.
mike_ehrmantraut  Okay, June Bug, these are for you.
kaylee_ehrmantraut  What about the rest
mike_ehrmantraut  rest? The rest are for me.
kaylee_ehrmantraut  No, they're not.
kaylee_ehrmantraut  You're too old for balloons.
mike_ehrmantraut  you're never too old for balloons.
mike_ehrmantraut  Give me a hug.
mike_ehrmantraut  Oh, I see your mama. Don't
mike_ehrmantraut  Don't keep her waiting.
peng  Please.
peng  Please, no.
mike_ehrmantraut  you have anything you want to tell me?
duane_chow  Thank God you're here.
duane_chow  They keep me prisoner.
mike_ehrmantraut  They keep you prisoner.
duane_chow  I don't do nothing for them ever.
duane_chow  They try and make me.
duane_chow  I say no.
duane_chow  They steal my chemicals.
duane_chow  I can't stop them.
duane_chow  I am businessman.
mike_ehrmantraut  You're a
mike_ehrmantraut  The lady out front
mike_ehrmantraut  front Hey, lady, are you still there?
mike_ehrmantraut  Ask her if she's still there.
duane_chow  She says yes.
mike_ehrmantraut  sighs How's her driving?
mike_ehrmantraut  Driving. Is
mike_ehrmantraut  Is she good behind the wheel?
duane_chow  Good.
duane_chow  She's good driver.
mike_ehrmantraut  Licensed?
mike_ehrmantraut  Dependable?
duane_chow  She has a Camry.
mike_ehrmantraut  Good.
mike_ehrmantraut  The trucks will be here first thing in the morning.
mike_ehrmantraut  I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time.
mike_ehrmantraut  So have her drive you to the hospital.
mike_ehrmantraut  She's gonna need her shoe.
mike_ehrmantraut  Laredo, looks like.
mike_ehrmantraut  They didn't exactly send their A players.
mike_ehrmantraut  like you said, it's cartel, all right.
gustavo_fring  Hmm.
mike_ehrmantraut  didn't find any.
gustavo_fring  Pinkman?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm making inquiries.
walter_white  That's two? All right
walter_white  Let's close it up.
walter_white  Bring it down. Ready? switch clicks machinery whirs Great. Okay.
walter_white  good.
walter_white  You can take your mask off now
gale_boetticher  that guy ever leave?
gale_boetticher  When exactly did that start?
walter_white  It's new.
walter_white  We had
walter_white  a little drama with the person you replaced.
walter_white  I'm sorry to hear that. No, it'll be fine.
walter_white  Things will continue to smooth out
gale_boetticher  be fine. By the way, if you're at all worried about working with me
walter_white  me Mo, I'm not
gale_boetticher  whatever my shortcomings last time, I intend for things to go perfectly from here on out
gale_boetticher  So, if there
walter_white  there is Gale,
gale_boetticher  I just
gale_boetticher  However you like things to be done is exactly how we are gonna do them.
gale_boetticher  Period.
gale_boetticher  From here on out.
gustavo_fring  Gale.
gustavo_fring  It's good to see you
gale_boetticher  Mr. Fring.
gale_boetticher  This is,
gustavo_fring  I should have called first.
gustavo_fring  I'm
gale_boetticher  not interrupting
gale_boetticher  No. No, not at all.
gale_boetticher  Please come in.
gale_boetticher  Can I offer you something?
gale_boetticher  CrÃ¨me de Menthe? Oh, no.
gustavo_fring  No
gustavo_fring  No, thank you.
gustavo_fring  I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
gale_boetticher  Oh, no, no.
gale_boetticher  It's no inconvenience.
gustavo_fring  I need to talk to you about something
gustavo_fring  something rather pressing.
gustavo_fring  If push came to shove, I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself.
gustavo_fring  You and an assistant.
gale_boetticher  Why would
gale_boetticher  Why would push come to shove?
gustavo_fring  Has Walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of
gale_boetticher  I guess I assumed it was because it pays so well.
gustavo_fring  it is, but specifically. Has he ever spoken to you about his health problems?
gustavo_fring  not surprised.
gustavo_fring  He's a very private
gale_boetticher  What exactly are his health problems
gustavo_fring  He's dying of cancer.
gustavo_fring  It is why he does this, to provide for his family, which he has accomplished.
gustavo_fring  They will never want for anything. He's seen to that.
gale_boetticher  Well how long does he have?
gustavo_fring  That is very much the question.
gustavo_fring  He does not want to talk about it,
gustavo_fring  and every time I bring it up with him Hmm. I don't know that he's fully accepted the reality of
gustavo_fring  it. And not to sound coldblooded, but I am running a business here.
gale_boetticher  No, I I understand.
gustavo_fring  I have a very large investment in this. There
gustavo_fring  There is so much overhead that I can't afford to shut down,
gustavo_fring  not even for a week.
gustavo_fring  So you understand my concern and my desire for continuity
gustavo_fring  I do, absolutely.
gustavo_fring  I intend to keep Walter on as long as he wants, assuming he's physically up to it.
gustavo_fring  But as he cannot or will not tell me how long that might be, I must prepare for the worstcase scenario.
gale_boetticher  scenario. Uh I suppose if we had at least a few more cooks together
gustavo_fring  You don't think you're ready now?
gale_boetticher  Well, he is such a
gale_boetticher  There's always more for me to learn.
Gale_Boetticher  But I'm thinking that if we had say, one or two more cooks?
gale_boetticher  One more I guess, would do it
gale_boetticher  I
gustavo_fring  I believe in you, Gale.
gustavo_fring  when the time comes, you will be ready.
walter_white  Hmm
gale_boetticher  any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed?
walter_white  No, it's pretty straightforward.
walter_white  I'll show you when we get there.
saul_goodman  beeps Yeah. Tell him I'm in conference.
saul_goodman  Can't you see I'm in conference?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm looking to find a client of yours.
mike_ehrmantraut  I was hoping you could help me out with an address.
saul_goodman  Which client?
mike_ehrmantraut  Jesse Pinkman.
saul_goodman  Jesse Pinkman in the phone book Jesse Pinkman.
saul_goodman  How would one track him down? I wonder.
saul_goodman  You're still here.
mike_ehrmantraut  I need your full attention, Saul.
mike_ehrmantraut  Jesse Pinkman current
mike_ehrmantraut  current whereabouts.
mike_ehrmantraut  The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to whatever the hell this is exactly.
saul_goodman  What am I, eightgrade hall monitor?
saul_goodman " Current whereabouts.
saul_goodman  Let me tell you something
mike_ehrmantraut  something, Mike Whoa. You are good right there.
mike_ehrmantraut  let's both get comfortable.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, when I say I'm looking for Pinkman, we both know why, don't we?
mike_ehrmantraut  And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me.
saul_goodman  stammering Mike, uh, there are rules to this lawyer thing.
mike_ehrmantraut  Is that right
saul_goodman  laughs Yeah
saul_goodman  Attorneyclient privilege.
saul_goodman  That's a big one.
saul_goodman  And that's something I provide for you.
saul_goodman  So if I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking" Old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy.
saul_goodman  What's to keep him from giving me up?"
saul_goodman  You see?
saul_goodman  So then where's the trust?
mike_ehrmantraut  trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in.
saul_goodman  Yeah, it's an argument.
mike_ehrmantraut  So don't make me beat you till your legs don't work.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now tell me where to find him.
mike_ehrmantraut  You know it's the right thing.
saul_goodman  I can't tell you, Mike. All right
saul_goodman  if I was to tell you, I just I couldn't live with myself.
saul_goodman  I'm sorry
saul_goodman  gasps But who's to say I didn't write the address down in my day planner?
saul_goodman  Or on a scratch piece of paper somewhere?
saul_goodman  Who's to say I didn't write down a location strictly for my own professional use?
saul_goodman  Do not touch anything on my desk.
saul_goodman  I'm gonna leave the room, make myself a NescafÃ©.
saul_goodman  I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
saul_goodman  Like a mother hen.
saul_goodman  Believe me, money laundering ain't what it used to be.
saul_goodman  God, do I miss the '80s.
walter_white  Wasting your time. I'm
walter_white  I'm buying the car wash. End of story.
saul_goodman  Well, one look at this place, you're gonna fall in love, so coughs
saul_goodman  Was I right?
saul_goodman  Where else are you gonna find a cashonly business that's this much fun?
saul_goodman  Unless we're talking massage parlors, and I don't see it.
saul_goodman  Shall we?
saul_goodman  You ever actually play laser tag?
saul_goodman  It's good cardio.
saul_goodman  Plus you get to shoot at kids.
saul_goodman  got your bumper cars over there down that way.
saul_goodman  Got your arcade right here. All the latest video games.
saul_goodman  Snack bar is over there.
saul_goodman  Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents. That's
saul_goodman  That's a whole new revenue stream.
walter_white  All right, enough.
walter_white  We're good.
saul_goodman  Holy Christ.
saul_goodman  We're good?
saul_goodman  This constitutes good where you're from?
saul_goodman  My car is bugged.
walter_white  I said maybe maybe
walter_white  maybe I'm
saul_goodman  I'm being followed. What
saul_goodman  What the hell have you gotten me into?
saul_goodman  My very own P. I. is threatening to break my legs. That's
saul_goodman  That's like Thomas Magnum threatening that little prissy guy with the mustache. Over
saul_goodman  Over and above.
saul_goodman  Servicewise, is is over and above. You
saul_goodman  You and I survive this, oh, I'm seriously rethinking my pricing. Yeah.
saul_goodman  And that goes double for you, HipHop.
saul_goodman  My guy's no dummy. Right?
saul_goodman  So I give us maybe 24 hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere.
saul_goodman  guys do your thing. Make it snappy.
saul_goodman  I'll go see if they have Tetris or something.
walter_white  you holding up?
jesse_pinkman  You?
walter_white  I got my old job back.
walter_white  At least until they kill me and Gale takes over.
jesse_pinkman  He's their boy, huh?
walter_white  He's their boy.
jesse_pinkman  long you think you've got?
walter_white  Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process.
walter_white  try to be as vague as possible, but I got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say.
walter_white  Maybe the only thing that's saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.
walter_white  Once he feels confident that he knows my entire method So
jesse_pinkman  You
walter_white  You know what we do.
jesse_pinkman  got to be some other way.
jesse_pinkman  Maybe it's better for you to just go to the cops
jesse_pinkman  All right
jesse_pinkman  I mean, I can't believe I'm saying that at all, but for your family?
jesse_pinkman  The DEA would love you. All the shit you could tell them
jesse_pinkman  Federal Witness Protection, that's a good deal.
jesse_pinkman  As for me, I'll hit the road, yo. I
jesse_pinkman  I mean I'll make it.
jesse_pinkman  We had a We had a good run.
walter_white  it's over. Never the DEA. The cook can't stop. That's the one thing I'm certain of. Production cannot stop.
walter_white  Gus can't afford to.
walter_white  So if I'm the only chemist that he's got, then I've got leverage. And leverage keeps me alive.
walter_white  It keeps you alive, too.
walter_white  I think I can see to
walter_white  If I'm the only chemist that he's got.
jesse_pinkman  I I can't do it, Mr.
jesse_pinkman  White.
walter_white  said, I'm I'm not a I can't do it. I'll do it. I'm gonna I'm gonna need your help.
walter_white  they're watching me day and night.
walter_white  They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment.
walter_white  Hell, I don't even know where the man lives.
walter_white  He's not in the phone book. I can't find him on the Internet. I can't do it in the lab. Victor's always there
walter_white  if I could just shake Victor for even an hour one night, I think then that I may be able to make it look like an accident.
jesse_pinkman  be some other way
walter_white  I'm all ears.
walter_white  But when it comes down to you and me versus him I'm sorry
walter_white  I'm truly sorry but it's gonna be him.
walter_white  You are the only edge that I've got, as long as they don't know that you're in town.
walter_white  But I need you to track him. Get me his address,
walter_white  and I'll do the rest.
walter_white  Look, I saved your life, Jesse.
walter_white  Are you gonna save mine?
walter_white  Please tell me you found him.
