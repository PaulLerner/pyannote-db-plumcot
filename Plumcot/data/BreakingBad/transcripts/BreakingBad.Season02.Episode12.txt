#unknown Back at work soon? Since you're scheduled for surgery I just thought it might be a good idea to have some money coming in.
#unknown Well, Skyler, we need to think about what's best for the baby.
#unknown And I think having her mother around for at least the first few years.
#unknown Moneywise, we'll manage.
#unknown I promise you that.
#unknown What? You guys got, like, a printing press in the garage churning out 50s? I wish.
#unknown Mom's even talking about me getting a job.

#unknown Why don't you have computers and shit? It's the 20th century.
#unknown What the hell are you doing here? Get out.
#unknown No.
#unknown You took the stash.
#unknown I heard all those messages, figured it out.
#unknown You figured it out, huh? Well, congratulations, Einstein.
#unknown You left me to freak out all day long like I dropped the ball or something and you were the one who took it! Shut up.
#unknown You lower your voice.
#unknown "Like you dropped the ball"? When have you ever not dropped the ball, Jesse? Blasted out of your mind on whatever the hell that was.
#unknown What was that, heroin? Jesus.
#unknown I was on my day off, man.
#unknown What I do on my day off "Day off"? We were on call, you junkie.
#unknown On call for the biggest deal of our lives.
#unknown I just managed to pull it off by the skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.
#unknown And you made me miss the birth of my daughter.
#unknown Son of a bitch.
#unknown How much? How much what? How much did you get for the deal? Onepointtwo million.
#unknown Six hundred thousand each.
#unknown Four hundred and eighty thousand.
#unknown Saul's cut is 20 percent.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So where's my money? What? You are joking, right? If I gave you that money you would be dead inside of a week.
#unknown Man, look, I'm off the heroin.
#unknown I didn't even like it anyway.
#unknown It made me sick.
#unknown And the.
#unknown And the meth.
#unknown You know, I could take it or leave it.
#unknown I'm clean, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown For real.
#unknown Prove it.
#unknown Pee in that.
#unknown How gay are you, seriously? Pee in it.
#unknown They're selling testing kits at the drugstores.
#unknown If you are clean, I will give you every last dime.
#unknown No, huh? Well, I guess, until then you'll just have to depend on the kindness of strangers to get high.
#unknown That and your little junkie girlfriend.
#unknown Not on her tummy, Walt.
#unknown I'm not putting her on her tummy.
#unknown I'll put her on her side.
#unknown Do you wanna hold her back? Yeah.
#unknown Right there.
#unknown Just in case she decides to do a little spitup I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel like this and put it under.
#unknown Hammacher Schlemmer makes a proper one of those.
#unknown It's hypoallergenic.
#unknown Oh, yeah? Well, I think a towel will do.
#unknown Skyler, what is it? Your son.
#unknown He is just unbelievable.
#unknown Come see what he did.
#unknown I told you it's not ready yet.
#unknown Honey, just show it to them.
#unknown My God, son.
#unknown That's wonderful.
#unknown Flynn.
#unknown This is beautiful.
#unknown SaveWalterWhite.
#unknown com.
#unknown Well, l, for one, am telling everybody.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown You're not asking for money, are you, son? Yeah.
#unknown That's the whole idea.
#unknown Louis helped me set up a PayPal account and everything.
#unknown See? But we can't ask for money.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I appreciate it.
#unknown I really do.
#unknown Show me what else you put on.
#unknown This was all his idea.
#unknown He worked so hard on it.
#unknown Just let him help.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown It's You can't ask him to take it down.
#unknown lt'll crush him.
#unknown Skyler, it's charity.
#unknown Why do you say that like it's some sort of dirty word? This is insane.
#unknown I have so much cash on hand that I actually count it by weighing it on my bathroom scale.
#unknown And yet, I can't spend it.
#unknown I can't tell my family about it.
#unknown All of whom think that I am right on the edge of bankruptcy.
#unknown I mean, it's It's insane.
#unknown Well, I guess that's why gangsters had molls.
#unknown What? Gun molls.
#unknown Haven't you ever seen White Heat? Yeah, I've seen White Heat but I don't see how that pertains.
#unknown Maybe you need a moll more than a wife who you can't trust with your secrets.
#unknown Just What good is money that doesn't spend? The tree falls in the forest.
#unknown You know, you get the point.
#unknown So communicating is out? Out.
#unknown Let's see.
#unknown What else is there? There's always, "Hey, I found a big bag of money down by the railroad tracks.
#unknown " No? No? Works for me.
#unknown Uncle Murray.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown Yeah, "Oh, many is the happy memory of Uncle Murray bouncing me on his knee.
#unknown We lost track of the old pervert years ago but he kicked it, left me millions.
#unknown " No, no.
#unknown It cannot be blind luck or some imaginary relative who saves us.
#unknown No, I earned that money, me.
#unknown And now my son created his own website SaveWalterWhite.
#unknown com, soliciting anonymous donations.
#unknown Do you have any idea how that makes me feel? Yeah, look at that.
#unknown It's got PayPal and everything.
#unknown Cyberbegging.
#unknown That's all that is.
#unknown Just rattling a little tin cup to the entire world.
#unknown Yeah, there's no deepseated issues there.
#unknown Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
#unknown It's staring me in the face.
#unknown Do I have to spell it out for you? I know.
#unknown I know.
#unknown You're thinking that I should be funnelling money into my son's website, but absolutely not.
#unknown I am not going to have my family think that some mystery benefactor saved us.
#unknown Not some mystery benefactor, singular.
#unknown That would raise too many questions.
#unknown However Stay with me here.
#unknown zombies.
#unknown I got a guy, who knows this guy, who knows this Rain Mantype.
#unknown He lives with his mother in her basement in Belarus, all right? So good luck extraditing his fat Russian ass.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown He's a hackercracker extraordinaire.
#unknown This guy can hijack random desktops all around the world, turn them into zombies that do his bidding.
#unknown For instance, he can make it so 20 or 30,000 Iittle donations come in from all over the U.
#unknown S.
#unknown and Canada.

#unknown Always acting like I'm his indentured servant.
#unknown Now the cotton.
#unknown Needle? I don't understand why you need him.
#unknown Exactly.
#unknown My point exactly.
#unknown Flat against your skin so it doesn't wiggle around too much.
#unknown How much does he owe you, anyway? Four hundred and eighty.
#unknown Oh, hell, I'd be mad too if somebody owed me 500 bucks.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Four hundred and eighty thousand.
#unknown What? What? Thousand.
#unknown Not on your back, in case you throw up.
#unknown On your side.

#unknown Eighteen months.
#unknown You have been clean for 18 months, Jane.
#unknown Why? Why do you do it? I backslid, okay? Like, what? What, you think I'm proud of this? Like I do it on purpose? Lying to me shacking up and using with this scumbag, this loser.
#unknown It takes one to know one.
#unknown His name is Jesse.
#unknown You don't know the first thing about him.
#unknown We talk about rehab every night.
#unknown It's his idea.

#unknown Oh, just let it ring.
#unknown No, I'm gonna go see who it is.
#unknown It's okay, Holly.
#unknown It's okay, sweetie.
#unknown Good luck with that.

#unknown This is Walter White.
#unknown Hello, Walter White.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I'm having a little trouble recalling It's Jane.
#unknown You know, of Jesse and Jane.
#unknown Jesse's "junkie girlfriend.
#unknown " Oh, yes, yes.
#unknown Of course.
#unknown It really has been a long time.
#unknown Get somewhere where you can talk.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown I am looking into that as we speak.
#unknown How the hell did you get this number? Did Jesse give it to you? All Jesse wants is what's coming to him.
#unknown No more, no less.
#unknown What are you talking about? Four hundred and eighty thousand.
#unknown He told you about the money.
#unknown He told me everything.
#unknown So, what is this? What, some kind of blackmail or something? This is me telling you to do right by Jesse.
#unknown Bring him what you owe him.
#unknown I don't call that blackmail.
#unknown I call that you getting off your ass, and being a decent human being.
#unknown Well, I call it blackmail.
#unknown Dialling my number.
#unknown Talking to my wife.
#unknown And what's your end of this? How much heroin does a half a million dollars buy? For your information, I am holding Jesse's money for him and he will receive every last dollar of it.
#unknown He will, not you at a time when I see fit.
#unknown But I will not contribute to his overdose.
#unknown Now you tell him, if he gets clean lf you both get clean You know what? I take that back.
#unknown This is blackmail.
#unknown Because what I know about you, highschool teacher turned drug dealer, with a brotherinlaw in the DEA that would make one hell of a story.
#unknown National news, I'll bet.
#unknown Do right by Jesse tonight or I will burn you to the ground.
#unknown Shit.
#unknown He's a highschool teacher.
#unknown What's he gonna do, give you a Bminus? Send you outside to clap the erasers? You wouldn't really go to the cops, would you? We won't have to.
#unknown He'll pay.
#unknown And what if he doesn't? Jesse, it's your money.
#unknown You're in the right here.
#unknown He's in the wrong.
#unknown He's not stupid.
#unknown He'll pay.
#unknown What is it, really? You don't want your half a million dollars? You wanna renounce your earthly possessions and become a monk? No, it's just, I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.
#unknown And by extension, you know, neither are you.
#unknown I mean, he's my partner.
#unknown I'm your partner.
#unknown The largest land animal in all the planet Iives in a tightly knit matriarchal society Ied by the eldest female in the herd.
#unknown Close your eyes and go to sleep.
#unknown She is finally asleep.
#unknown What you doing, learning about elephants? Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
#unknown Would you mind going out? Jesse.
#unknown Not you.
#unknown Nice job wearing the pants.
#unknown How do I know she'll keep quiet? I guess you don't.
#unknown You'll never hear from either of us again.
#unknown You're not seeing straight, Jesse.
#unknown You are making a mistake.
#unknown Do you know what this is? It's a whole lot of cheddar.
#unknown This is freedom.
#unknown This is saying, "l can go anywhere I want.
#unknown I can be anybody.
#unknown " Who do you wanna be? Where do you wanna go? South America? Europe? Australia? ls New Zealand part of Australia? New Zealand is New Zealand.
#unknown Right on.
#unknown New Zealand.
#unknown That's where they made Lord of the Rings.
#unknown I say we just move there, yo.
#unknown I mean, you can do your art.
#unknown Right? Like, you can paint, like, the local castles and shit.
#unknown And I can be a bush pilot.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown New Zealand.
#unknown I can get behind that.
#unknown But I guess I'm good anywhere as long as it's the two of us.
#unknown But first, we gotta get clean.
#unknown And not because anybody is telling us to.
#unknown We do this for us, right? Yeah.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown For us.
#unknown All this here, we're not gonna just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.
#unknown We're not.
#unknown Hell, no.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown We're better than that.
#unknown We're way better than that.
#unknown I say.
#unknown I say we flush what we've got left and we start tonight.
#unknown Yeah, we can do that.
#unknown Definitely.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown What can I get you? Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown Hey, honey.
#unknown No.
#unknown I don't know what to tell you.
#unknown Three stores I've been to so far, and not one of them have it in stock.
#unknown Well, do they have to be diapers for newborns? What if we went up a size and just kind of.
#unknown All right, all right.

#unknown Ostensibly, turning Mars into a giant gas station.
#unknown So it's a.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown We live in an amazing time.
#unknown To water on Mars.

#unknown I've got a 16yearold boy.
#unknown Well, he's almost 16.
#unknown Jeez.
#unknown Oh, there's a spread, huh? But he helps out, though.
#unknown He's even changing some diapers now, so.
#unknown It's more than I managed to do when I was his age.
#unknown Kids today grow up faster, I think.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown Yeah, maybe so.
#unknown So, any advice? Having a daughter.
#unknown Any advice? No, not really.
#unknown Just love them.
#unknown Just Yeah.
#unknown I mean, they are who they are.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I've got this nephew.
#unknown This nephew who is I mean, he's an adult.
#unknown But you can't infantilize them, you can't live their life for them.
#unknown But still, I mean, there is that frustration.
#unknown You know, that.
#unknown God, that frustration that goes along with, you know: "Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know what is best for you, so listen.
#unknown " But of course, they don't.
#unknown I mean, what do you do with someone like that? Family? Yeah.
#unknown Family.
#unknown You can't give up on them.
#unknown Never.
#unknown I mean, what else is there? Jesse, it's me.
