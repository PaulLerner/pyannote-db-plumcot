#unknown [Buzzing] Mr.
#unknown White? Hello? [Buzzing] Mr.
#unknown White, the, uh, car's been dealt with, sir.
#unknown No one tailed you? No.
#unknown I stayed off the main streets and kept checking, so Joe ask any questions? I told him RV job, just like you said, and he totally knew.
#unknown It's pretty cool the way they do that Turn a car into a cube.
#unknown So, should we deal with this other thing now? [Buzzing] [Sighs] Yeah.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown [Car alarm chirps] I don't want to talk about this.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown It had to be done.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I need to talk to you.
#unknown In private.
#unknown So what's the story? You get to Mike? Mmhmm.
#unknown He get out safe? He's gone.
#unknown [Sighs] All right.
#unknown Well, what about those nine guys in jail? They got no reason not to talk now.
#unknown So what do we do? "We"? Who's "we"? There is no "we," Jesse.
#unknown I'm the only vote left, and I'll handle it.
#unknown [Door closing] Gliding Over All My client will supply vital information relating to the organization, distribution, and production of Fring's methamphetamine enterprise.
#unknown In exchange, we expect all charges to be dropped, and Dennis not only walks out of here a free man, but also receives blanket immunity.
#unknown [Scoffs] For what he's gonna be furnishing, this deal is plenty fair.
#unknown [Scoffs] Best I'd be willing to do is queen for a day and reduced charges.
#unknown All charges dropped.
#unknown Queen for a day and a fiveK.
#unknown That's the best you're gonna get.
#unknown No way.
#unknown Guys, come on.
#unknown You can be a fairy princess, for all I care.
#unknown Where you going? I'm going shopping for someone who can tell me something I don't already know.
#unknown Hey, hey.
#unknown I got plenty you don't know.
#unknown You seem a little confused.
#unknown This here is a buyer's market.
#unknown I got eight other assholes just like you, four of them within I also got Dan the douche bag lawyer who's gonna give me the money and Ehrmantraut.
#unknown So settle in, Dennis.
#unknown Enjoy your new home.
#unknown I'm gonna go rattle some cages.
#unknown [Door opens, closes] So? Maybe you should order something.
#unknown Do you want a coffee or something? Not just now.
#unknown I think this would play better if you ordered something.
#unknown I think this will play just fine, and I'm not thirsty.
#unknown So let's take a look at the list.
#unknown Lydia, you've come all this way.
#unknown You do have the list?  Yes, I have it.
#unknown Good.
#unknown It's just not written down.
#unknown And why is that? It's in my head.
#unknown Safer there.
#unknown I see.
#unknown Then I suggest you pick up a pen.
#unknown Not just yet.
#unknown It was my understanding that attending to these nine names was precisely what you wanted.
#unknown Ten names now.
#unknown Ten, counting the lawyer.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Ten, counting the lawyer.
#unknown So, what, am I not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit? You're tying up loose ends, and I don't wanna be one of them.
#unknown Once I give you that list, I've served my purpose, and then maybe I'm just one more person who knows too much.
#unknown So, you put that list in my hands, and in your mind, I immediately just murder you,  just right here in this restaurant?  No.
#unknown Right here in this public place, immediately?  Not right here.
#unknown That is not what I  Listen, Lydia.
#unknown You made me promise on my children's lives that I guaranteed your safety.
#unknown From Mike.
#unknown You guaranteed I'd be safe from Mike.
#unknown There's no way he'd ever go for this You getting rid of his guys.
#unknown You wouldn't be doing this The names if Mike were still a factor.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That's what I thought.
#unknown What do you want, exactly? Because if you don't want to give me that list, then I've truly got no use for you.
#unknown I can grow your business exponentially.
#unknown Just give me the list.
#unknown I can do that by helping you expand into a larger, highly active, highly profitable marketplace.
#unknown What do you know about the Czech Republic? The Czech Republic? Did you know there's a higher demand for meth there than anywhere else in Europe? Five percent of its ten million people, which is roughly the population of the Southwest from Western Texas to Phoenix, are using meth.
#unknown You keep your market here, but by adding overseas sales, you can more than double your current profits.
#unknown And I checked.
#unknown The average purity is only about 60 percent.
#unknown They've never seen anything like your product.
#unknown You'll blow their hair back.
#unknown Shipping internationally seems like courting disaster.
#unknown Not if you're Madrigal.
#unknown Madrigal is under investigation by the DEA.
#unknown The restaurant division, mostly.
#unknown We've got 46,000 employees spread across 14 divisions.
#unknown And once Mike's people are no longer a factor, things should tidy up nicely.
#unknown This is what I do, you understand? I move things from point A to point B all over the globe.
#unknown a month, and all of it right at my fingertips, a laptop click away.
#unknown The Czech Republic Who's there on the other end? People I ship to regularly.
#unknown People I've worked with for years.
#unknown They're professional and very amenable.
#unknown I'm very careful who I work with.
#unknown And if this is such a slam dunk, then why didn't you pitch it to Fring? I did.
#unknown He said yes.
#unknown We were in the final stages of working it out when somebody killed him.
#unknown You don't think Gus Fring built his distribution network all by himself? There are considerable advantages to diversification of distribution, like putting 6,000 miles between you and your product.
#unknown At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating you'll gross about two million.
#unknown Give me ten pounds to start, and we'll see how it goes.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Now, with Fring, my end was gonna be 30 percent,  which I believe is more than fair.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Trust me, if you do this  Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer.
#unknown Now, first things first.
#unknown Shake on it? We're going to make a lot of money together.
#unknown [Door opens] [Door closes] [Beeps] Todd, I think it's time I meet your uncle.
#unknown [Man] No iron pile.
#unknown There's too many muscleheads flexing their shit.
#unknown Too many eyes.
#unknown [Man #2] Okay, so no chow line, no yard.
#unknown Gonna keep it simple.
#unknown Passbyes.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Hallways, shower room, cells.
#unknown The easy stuff.
#unknown [Man #3] I say we go with a riot.
#unknown Our boys get it done in a riot.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown No chaos.
#unknown I don't want the goon squad rolling in and stealing our shot, you know? This has gotta be fast and quiet.
#unknown Just boom, boom, boom.
#unknown You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.
#unknown Surgical.
#unknown Surgical.
#unknown That's what it's gotta be.
#unknown So how many guys we got at MDC? Three, counting Shaddock.
#unknown And he makes the schedule now, so we can put who we need where we need them.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So MDC's covered.
#unknown What about the rest? We need G block in Valencia, right? Our guy's on the night shift.
#unknown Have him pull a double.
#unknown Nah.
#unknown His supervisor's got some hardon about OT.
#unknown Have him switch with somebody.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Just get it done.
#unknown Regardless, you know, we got enough guys in Valencia right now? Might have to hire out.
#unknown You high? Mix blood with chuntaros?  No way.
#unknown Well There's no need.
#unknown We got enough.
#unknown Hitters ain't the problem.
#unknown It's that short walking window after lunch.
#unknown Mmhmm.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's gonna be tight.
#unknown Real tight.
#unknown You know, I gotta be straight with you, man.
#unknown Taking out all these guys is doable.
#unknown But hitting them in three separate jails all within two minutes? Whacking Bin Laden wasn't this complicated.
#unknown [Chuckling] Where do you suppose these come from? I've seen this one before.
#unknown I wonder, are they all in some giant warehouse someplace? Hey.
#unknown It can be done, just not the way you want it.
#unknown It can be done exactly how I want it.
#unknown The only question is, are you the man to do it? Figure it out.
#unknown That's what I'm paying you for.
#unknown [Chuckling] [Sighs] [Ticking]  [Lounge music] [Crying out] [Door rattles] [Blows landing] Aah! [Men grunting] [Grunting] [Ticking continues] [Alarm blaring] [Men grunting] [Thud] [Alarm continues] [Muffled yelling] What's happening? Oh! Oh! No, man! Help me! Help me! Help! Help me! [Ticking stops] [Sighs] [Laughter] Excuse me a second.
#unknown Grab more photos, will you? [Phone ringing] Yes? [Man] It's done.
#unknown New details have emerged in the spate of jail deaths that rocked central New Mexico three days ago.
#unknown As of yet, no names of victims have been released, but authorities continue to investigate what appears to be a carefully coordinated sequence of attacks that occurred within minutes of one another in three different correctional facilities  Is it okay if I turn this off?  Oh, sure.
#unknown I don't want the news on right now.
#unknown Hank just pulled up, and he's not in the best mood.
#unknown Oh, all right.
#unknown Well, I'll get out of your hair.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hi, honey.
#unknown Mwah! Dinner will be in about an hour.
#unknown And I thought we could have that chicken that you like.
#unknown Or or we could order Chinese?  Sure.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown There you are.
#unknown Wanna play with your toys? I'll see you in a little bit, okay? See you in a little bit.
#unknown Hey, Hank.
#unknown I was just getting ready to leave.
#unknown Want a drink? Um, yeah, sure.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown [Coos] Perfect.
#unknown [Mutters]  Rocks, right?  Rocks, yes.
#unknown [Holly cooing] [Sighs] Been thinking about this summer job I used to have.
#unknown Oh, yeah? Back in college, I'd spend my days marking trees in the woods with this this orange spray can.
#unknown Marking trees? Yeah.
#unknown Crews would come in later and find the trees I tagged and cut them down.
#unknown First, you go in, and you mark locations for skid trails and landings.
#unknown Then you choose specific trees all within a selected grid.
#unknown [Sighs] Every day, I'd go back, hike in, pick up where I left off.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Sounds nice, being out in the woods all day.
#unknown Nah, it wasn't so great.
#unknown I got sunburned.
#unknown There were mosquitoes.
#unknown I just wanted to make a few bucks.
#unknown Buy beer.
#unknown Been thinking about that job more and more lately.
#unknown Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.
#unknown Tagging trees is a lot better than chasing monsters.
#unknown I used to love to go camping.
#unknown [Pop rock]  [Continues] [Song fades out] This way.
#unknown Here, baby girl.
#unknown Come see your brother.
#unknown There you go, sweetie.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown [Cooing] Oh, my God! Look at her go! Good job! [Walter, Jr.
#unknown ]  Peekaboo.
#unknown This way.
#unknown [Skyler]  Good job! Here.
#unknown Let's go see your brother.
#unknown Let's get him.
#unknown Get him!  Where'd you go? I can't see you.
#unknown Where'd you go? There you are! [Chuckling] [Laughing] You're really good with her.
#unknown [Coughing] Come here, my baby girl.
#unknown You're gonna be a handful, aren't you? Yeah.
#unknown Mama's gonna get her exercise.
#unknown Aw.
#unknown [Cooing] [Cooing continues] [Sighs] Hey, do you, uh You wanna watch a movie? [Phone ringing] Hey, Louis.
#unknown Uh [Clears throat] One moment.
#unknown Uh, nothing.
#unknown [Chuckles] What's up? [Sighs] Oh, well.
#unknown [Sighs] [Chuckles] It's nice to see you smile again.
#unknown I mean, you seem good.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm hanging in there.
#unknown To see you laugh like that just now It's such an improvement, don't you think? I don't I don't really [Stammers] We've been thinking, Hank and I, that it may be time to take the kids home.
#unknown It's been almost three months, right? Almost three? Um Ddoes Hank not want Oh, no, no, no.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Hank's crazy for these kids.
#unknown You know that.
#unknown It goes without saying, we love having them.
#unknown And we're always here for you and wanna help you any way that we can.
#unknown But We're starting to worry that maybe Maybe we're enabling you.
#unknown Sweetie, you've had a lot on your plate, and you and Walt have had a lot so much to contend with.
#unknown And I'm so proud of you for going to therapy, by the way.
#unknown You know that, right? It can be so helpful, such a good tool.
#unknown And I'm very, very proud of you, but I We Maybe at this point, the best way to help repair the family would be to repair the family, you know? [Crickets chirping] [Water lapping softly] Take a drive with me.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown This is it.
#unknown This is what you've been working for.
#unknown I rented this place, and I started bringing it here, because I didn't know what else to do.
#unknown I gave up counting it.
#unknown I mean, I had to.
#unknown It was just so much, so fast.
#unknown I I tried weighing it.
#unknown I figured one bill of any denomination weighs a gram.
#unknown There are 454 grams to a pound, but [Exhales forcefully] there's a variety of denominations, so How much is this? I have no earthly idea.
#unknown I truly don't.
#unknown I just stack it up, keep it dry, spray it for silverfish.
#unknown There is more money here than we could spend in ten lifetimes.
#unknown I certainly can't launder it, not with 100 car washes.
#unknown Walt I want my kids back.
#unknown I want my life back.
#unknown Please tell me How much is enough? How big does this pile have to be? [Soft whirring] [Click] [Mechanical humming] [Clacking] [Towel dispenser clicks] [Door opens] Ow! Aw, shit! [Sighs] [Knocking on door] [Knocking] Hi.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Um, I I hope I'm not disturbing you or anything.
#unknown I tried calling, but, uh Yeah.
#unknown No, I, uh, tossed all my burners.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown And you didn't answer your home line, so It's disconnected.
#unknown Oh, um, unplugged, I mean.
#unknown Did you leave a message, or Uh, no.
#unknown So, what's up? I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.
#unknown You, uh, wanna come in, or Uh, sure.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown You know, I'd offer you a a beer or something, but No, no.
#unknown No, I'm I'm I'm I'm fine, thanks.
#unknown You, uh, didn't wind up moving, I see.
#unknown Didn't have to.
#unknown Saul told me what you did.
#unknown Anyways, uh, I'm not in jail.
#unknown You aren't either, so there you go.
#unknown There was no other option, Jesse.
#unknown It had to be done.
#unknown I'm not coming back.
#unknown I know.
#unknown So why are you here, exactly? [Chuckles] It's funny.
#unknown I I saw a Bounder the other day.
#unknown Bounder?  Yeah.
#unknown Our RV? A Bounder? Oh.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Oh, you saw the same one as ours? Yeah.
#unknown Well, within a couple years, I guess.
#unknown Early '80s.
#unknown It was certainly in a lot better shape than our old hunk of junk.
#unknown A much nicer paint job.
#unknown No bullet holes in the door.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That thing was a nightmare, huh? Oh, it was primitive.
#unknown You know, whenever I hit a red light, I used to pray it wouldn't crap out on me.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown And then, suddenly, it would sometimes have that that screeching sound that just out of the blue, like we hit a pack of cats.
#unknown Power steering belt.
#unknown That's what that was.
#unknown I always had this this whole system strategy to not let it idle too low.
#unknown Remember that time we ran out of gas coming back from a cook? Ah, the gauge.
#unknown The gauge always said halffull, so Yeah, you had to walk three miles with a jerry can while I waited on the side of the road, praying the whole time that no cop would show up, no good samaritan.
#unknown God.
#unknown We had money.
#unknown Why'd we keep it? Why did we have to have the world's shittiest RV?  Inertia?  Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Inertia.
#unknown So, hey, um, you know, I gotta get going.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown No, me too.
#unknown I'm just meeting up with some friends, and I gotta get going as well.
#unknown I left something for you.
#unknown [Car door opens, closes] [Engine starts] [Car departing] [Panting] [Door opens] [Door closes] Hey.
#unknown I'm out.
#unknown I'm out.
#unknown [Marie] With some big earrings, it could be really nice.
#unknown Perhaps some big hoops.
#unknown I feel like I just want to mix it up with my hair this summer.
#unknown You know, like color [Hank]  Yeah.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown [Walt] Did you have a coin collection? I had coins.
#unknown have the time to do hobbies.
#unknown Coins and baseball cards.
#unknown Those were the ones.
#unknown You can play around with it and take them in and out Not enough hours in the day, right?  Not enough hours [Marie]  My hairstylist told me to take prenatal vitamins.
#unknown For your hair? He said they work, so I figure why not? Oh, uh, Flynn, could you put some more sunscreen on Holly? Yeah.
#unknown Is it over there?  Yeah, it's right here.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown for a home brew, though.
#unknown Papafree.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown Although I don't know why it would be bad.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I know.
#unknown Me neither.
#unknown Oh, do you I used to squeeze lemon juice in my hair.
#unknown You remember that? You wanted to be a beach bum so badly.
#unknown I did.
#unknown Ohh.
#unknown You and your stiff hair.
#unknown [Groaning]  Stiff what?  Hey, hey.
#unknown I was interested to see you get into that.
#unknown Borage oil is supposed to be good.
#unknown It's like chemistry.
#unknown Is it really? Better than flaxseed?  I don't know.
#unknown That's cool.
#unknown I like your style.
#unknown There is no Christmas.
#unknown There is no Christmas Maybe I should brew up a batch.
#unknown What do you think?  Ooh, Schraderbrau?  Yeah.
#unknown I vote yes.
#unknown I second that.
#unknown Well, there you go.
#unknown It's unanimous.
#unknown Well, who am I to fly in the face of public demand, right? [Chuckling] All right.
#unknown Hold on.
#unknown [Grunts] Anybody, uh anybody want anything? Want anything? No, I'm good.
#unknown I'm good, thank you.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Does it look glossier?  Do I have a halo?  I don't know.
#unknown How's she doing?  She's good.
#unknown I used to have that halo.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown [Conversation continues, faint] [Sighs] Ahhh.
#unknown [Cracks knuckle] [Sighs] [Hank's voice] "To W.
#unknown W.
#unknown , my star, my perfect silence.
#unknown " [Chuckles] W.
#unknown W.
#unknown [Chuckling] I mean, who do you figure that is, you know? Woodrow Wilson? Willy Wonka? Walter White? [Chuckles] You got me.
#unknown
