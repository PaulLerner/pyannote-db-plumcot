#unknown Operation Icebreaker.
#unknown How we liking that? We never used that before, did we?  Isn't it the name of a breath mint?  What? "Icebreakers", right? Breath mint? Nobody's gonna be thinking that.
#unknown They'll think about a big ass ship in the North Pole, breaking ice.
#unknown Says you.
#unknown I'm gonna be thinking "Operation Breath Mint.
#unknown " I'm thinking "Operation Breath Mint" every time we're on a stakeout together.
#unknown Your breath could knock a buzzard off a shit wagon.
#unknown All right.
#unknown "Operation TBD.
#unknown " Thanks for nothing, Gomie.
#unknown Anyway.
#unknown Say hello to Domingo Gallardo Molina, AKA "Krazy 8.
#unknown " Smarter than your average cheeseeater.
#unknown I turned him out at the streetlevel, but this dude's like the Jeffersons: movin' on up.
#unknown Every smalltime dealers he'd throw at us, he'd end up snaking their customers.
#unknown It turns out he's missing, presumed dead.
#unknown Found his car out in the boonies.
#unknown Last guy he ratted out was none other than his cousin, Emilio Koyama.
#unknown You thinking the cousin found out and took revenge? Could be.
#unknown Turns out he's missing, too.
#unknown Normally, I'd say someone did the world a favor.
#unknown But our snitch's car? Turns out we find two grams of meth in it, we take it to the lab.
#unknown They come back, they tell us it is the purest they have ever seen.
#unknown Our chemist was blown away.
#unknown He said he couldn't do the same thing better.
#unknown Worse yet, it didn't come out of some superlab in Mexico.
#unknown We're thinking this was cooked right here, in the Land of Enchantment.
#unknown Car was abandoned at what appears to be a cook site.
#unknown This is the only other thing left behind.
#unknown We're sending it off to Quantico, see if they can pull something off it.
#unknown Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter element and found the same 99.
#unknown 1 meth.
#unknown So be on notice.
#unknown We got new players in town.
#unknown We don't know who they are, where they come from but they possess an extremely high skillset.
#unknown Me personally? Jesus.
#unknown Walt, you're burning the shit out of them.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken? Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack.
#unknown All right, looking good.
#unknown Is this lowfat mayonnaise in the cole slaw? I don't know.
#unknown It's storebought.
#unknown Hank, you need another beer? Does the Pope shit in his hat? I don't think that he does, Hank.
#unknown And I think everybody would like it if you'd stop saying that.
#unknown Marie, some more wine, maybe?  I'm all right, thanks.
#unknown Hey, I want a beer.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I want Shania Twain to give me a tuggie.
#unknown Guess what? That ain't happening, either.
#unknown How about some more soda?  Yeah, sure.
#unknown Honey, do you need anything?  No, Walt.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'll be right back.
#unknown What, are you kidding me? You look like a damn movie star, man.
#unknown Girls gotta be lining up left and right.
#unknown Tell him how goodlooking he is.
#unknown He's adorable.
#unknown He don't wanna be friggin' adorable.
#unknown He wants to be hot.
#unknown You see what I'm talking about? That's a female perspective.
#unknown She supposed to say that.
#unknown Look, a guy doesn't have to look like, uh Charlton Heston I'm talking "Moses" days to get a girl, all right? You just gotta have confidence.
#unknown Confidence and and persistence.
#unknown That's what I'm talking about.
#unknown I chased your Aunt Marie here all over creation.
#unknown I kept bugging her for a date.
#unknown She kept saying no.
#unknown What, did I ask you like 50 times? It was before they tightened the stalking laws.
#unknown Anyway, how about your dad here? Right there's a good story, Walt.
#unknown Tell him how you met Skyler.
#unknown Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos.
#unknown And Dad said that thing to you Actually, your mother wasn't a waitress.
#unknown It was a summer job, and she was the hostess, and she also worked the cash register.
#unknown And I used to go in there a lot because it was close enough to the lab where I could ride my bicycle.
#unknown And once I noticed her it got to be so that I would only go in when I knew she was working.
#unknown When it was slow, she would lean against the counter, doing her crossword puzzles, but kind of hiding it, right, pretending that she was still working.
#unknown And once I caught on to that, I would do crossword puzzles while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.
#unknown It got so that everyday at lunch, we would both be doing the New York Times crossword puzzle ten feet from each other.
#unknown Eventually, I caught her looking over at me.
#unknown So, I began saying, "Excuse me.
#unknown "Fourteen across, sevenletter word for whatchamacallit.
#unknown "May I ask what you wrote down?" That got us talking.
#unknown Boy, I tell you, I was I was terrible at those puzzles.
#unknown I don't think that I finished even one of them.
#unknown But your mother would do them in ink.
#unknown Very smooth.
#unknown I'll bet you didn't think your old man had it in him? But that's what I'm talking about.
#unknown That's persistence.
#unknown You see? Once you set your cap for something, or somebody, you gotta just, you know Skyler? Mom, are you all right? Shh, honey.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown What's the matter? What is it? Ask him.
#unknown What's she talking about? Walt.
#unknown I have cancer.
#unknown Lung cancer.
#unknown It's bad.
#unknown Ask him how long he's known.
#unknown I guess a month, maybe, or For God sakes, Walt.
#unknown We're just sitting out there having a cookout like nothing's going on? He made me promise not to tell anybody.
#unknown Christ, these last 48 hours.
#unknown And it's the weekend, so I couldn't even get his doctor on the phone.
#unknown Buddy, why I mean, why wouldn't you want to tell anybody? Don't you see? Everybody just wants to help you.
#unknown We're family.
#unknown We get through these things together.
#unknown I mean, I don't get You know Lung cancer? How could that happen? You don't smoke.
#unknown I'm thinking that this goes back to the applications lab.
#unknown All those chemicals they had you working around? We always took the proper precautions.
#unknown One time you complained they didn't give you the right kind of I don't know, some kind of ventilation hood or something.
#unknown And then the headaches.
#unknown Honey, it wasn't that.
#unknown How do they think they can get away with this? We should hire a lawyer.
#unknown First, let's deal with this.
#unknown Okay? So what's the next step for Walt? Certainly a second opinion, right? Right.
#unknown Right.

#unknown There's no denying it's very serious.
#unknown But is it It is curable? I prefer the word "treatable.
#unknown " But the treatments we have at our disposal can be very effective.
#unknown Without making any promises, I can tell you that the specific course of radiation and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest has been successful.
#unknown In certain cases, it prolonged patients' lives and even resulted in remission.
#unknown What about the side effects? Well, they can be mild to practically nonexistent, or they can be pretty darn awful.
#unknown It varies from patient to patient.
#unknown Typically, there's hair loss, which begins a couple of weeks after the start of chemotherapy.
#unknown You may find yourself unusually fatigued, not much energy.
#unknown You won't want to get out of bed.
#unknown You may lose weight due to reduced appetite and certain intestinal issues.
#unknown Muscle aches and pains, gums get sore and bleed.
#unknown And, of course, there's the possibility of nausea.
#unknown Although, we'll prescribe an antiemetic and try to counteract that.
#unknown Possible kidney or bladder irritation.
#unknown You may wind up with increased bruising and bleeding.
#unknown There may be sexual side effects.
#unknown Your skin may become dry and irritated Got anything to say? What do you know about that?  Nothing.
#unknown That's not going to fly this time.
#unknown How many chances have we given you? How many times have we sat right here and had the same conversation over and over again where you look us in the eye and you plead ignorance, and you play on our emotions, and you tell us anything you think we want to hear just so we'll give you another chance? And it makes us feel like fools, every time.
#unknown Enough, Jesse.
#unknown Enough.
#unknown We are not going to have this in our house.
#unknown We need you to leave.
#unknown Thanks for not telling on me.

#unknown You know, this is actually very hopeful.
#unknown Did you hear me? I said this is really very, very hopeful.
#unknown Can I call them and tell them you'll start next week? I just think that we need to discuss it a little more, that's all.
#unknown What is there to discuss? You're going to get the best treatment and he's the best.
#unknown Well, there's the money discussion.
#unknown $90,000 out of pocket.
#unknown Maybe more.
#unknown There's a way, Walt.
#unknown There's financing, there's installment plans.
#unknown I could always go back to work.
#unknown Walt, there's always a way.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Skyler, say that there is a way.
#unknown And we spend all that money, and Am I supposed to leave you with all that debt? I just don't want emotions ruling us.
#unknown Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.
#unknown Then why don't you just fucking die already? Just give up and die.
#unknown Come on, move your ass.
