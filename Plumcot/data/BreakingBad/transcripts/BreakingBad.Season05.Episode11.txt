#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad Have Skyler bring the kids here.
#unknown That is not going to happen.
#unknown I don't even know who I'm talking to.
#unknown Tread lightly.
#unknown Hank, are you arresting me? Am I under arrest!? Okay boys, take it all, let's get everything.
#unknown Do you know about that money thing? Involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Hey, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown It's me.
#unknown Um, I know you're probably real busy with retirement, but I just I got some news I think that you should maybe know about.
#unknown Me and Declan had some differences of opinion, and it got a little messy.
#unknown Um, any It's all straightened out now, but just a headsup there's been a kind of change in management.
#unknown Anyway, um, just thought you should know.
#unknown Feel free to give me a call if you want the details, but, you know, it's cool.
#unknown So whatever.
#unknown Okay then.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Right, so there I am, I'm on top of the train, pumping the water in, and he's watching to make sure we put in exactly what he calculated.
#unknown And we gotta be real precise, because water and methylene weigh different, and he, like, figured it all out to the, like, milliliter.
#unknown Anyway, I'm up there with my hose, and we're going as fast as we can.
#unknown 'Cause we only got a few minutes.
#unknown At the crossing, we got this guy who's smoothtalking the engineer.
#unknown And it's all just going great, until this other dude shows up in this monster truck, so we're pretty much screwed, because he can just push the entire dump truck off the tracks, which, you know, is what he does.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown What's your guy doing? You can't stop him? Yeah.
#unknown But what's he gonna say? "Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends are still stealing cargo back there"? Anyway, so I'm looking all around, 'cause I know we're not done, but the gallons are just slowly ticking away.
#unknown And finally Mr.
#unknown White tells me to cut it.
#unknown And so I fling the hose, I'm grabbing the cap, I'm screwing in the bolts.
#unknown Just, like, busting ass, you know? And, um, and then I feel the train start moving.
#unknown You're  I'm on top.
#unknown Did you piss your pants? Yeah, right? So the thing starts speeding up, so I jump off the moving train.
#unknown Like, total stuntman stuff.
#unknown It's like Hooper.
#unknown You ever see Hooper? Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.
#unknown Good movie.
#unknown But he jumped out of a helicopter, not a train.
#unknown Well, whatever, man.
#unknown It's a good movie.
#unknown And this guy Jesse, he's underneath the thing, and the train just drives right over him.
#unknown And luckily he's he's this skinny little guy.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown That's a tight operation.
#unknown It was it was perfect.
#unknown No one even knew they got robbed, just like we planned.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White told me it was, like, the biggest train heist ever, like, potential moneywise.
#unknown So that's how that happened.
#unknown Can I get you anything else? Nope.
#unknown Thanks, darlin'.
#unknown I'm ready for the check.
#unknown You feeling good about cooking? Yeah.
#unknown You'll be able to run your own lab? Do it up right? Yeah.
#unknown For sure.
#unknown I got this.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let's make some money, then.
#unknown I gotta hit the head.
#unknown Ever been on a plane and find yourself looking down at the armrest next to you, looking at the little plug where the ashtray used to go? I look at that and I say, "What the hell happened to this country?" Nanny state.
#unknown I see a kid with a bicycle helmet on, I wanna smack the shit out of him.
#unknown Like, for his own good.
#unknown _ Mr.
#unknown Pinkman.
#unknown How are you today? Not so good, huh? 'Course, uh, I might be able to help you out.
#unknown I wanna talk to you about your partner, Heisenberg.
#unknown See, I know he's my brotherinlaw, Walt.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown That's the look.
#unknown Lucky for you, I'm more interested in him.
#unknown So I got an offer.
#unknown If you help me out here, tell me all about you and him and your little meth business, maybe I talk to my friends at the APD and make all this go away.
#unknown I know he's the mastermind here.
#unknown Plus I'm thinking based on your recent activities that, uh maybe there's a little trouble in paradise? Maybe you guys aren't, uh, getting along so good? I'm right, aren't I? Eat me.
#unknown Sure that's how you want to play this? Why don't you try and beat it out of me? That's your thing, right? He really did a number on you, didn't he? I don't know, but happy people usually don't go around throwing millions of dollars away.
#unknown I don't think, uh, Walt's gonna be patting you on the back for that.
#unknown But maybe that's the point.
#unknown 'Cause, you see, I get that.
#unknown My own brotherinlaw lying to me for over a year, using me.
#unknown Maybe you understand that feeling.
#unknown Help me out here, Jesse and we can put him away.
#unknown I know you want that.
#unknown I think you wanna talk.
#unknown Not to you.
#unknown Agent Schrader.
#unknown Beat any good suspects lately? Hey, tall and taller, ask him his history with my client.
#unknown He knocked the poor kid unconscious last time they were alone together.
#unknown So what'll it be, gentlemen, a civil rights lawsuit the size of Montana? 'Cause I'll oblige you.
#unknown Oh, so long, Rocky.
#unknown Keep your left up.
#unknown Detectives, I'm inviting you to leave.
#unknown Okay, I'm gonna try to remain calm, but will you do me a favor and tell me what is up with you? My guys are busting their asses trying to hide Walt's money from the feds, and you're tossing yours out a window? And I have to hear about your little act of philanthropy on the news? Did you hit your head or something? Why didn't you call me the second you got arrested? What did you say to Schrader? Nothing.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Just chill out.
#unknown Chill out? No no, I don't chill out right now, 'cause things have gone nuclear.
#unknown I imagine Schrader shared with you his recent discovery.
#unknown Okay, well, then you get my complete lack of chill.
#unknown Just use the money that I gave you.
#unknown No, Saul.
#unknown Saul.
#unknown I Sto Saul.
#unknown Stop talking.
#unknown I don't care.
#unknown Just just make it happen.
#unknown Work your magic.
#unknown And call me when he's out.
#unknown Hey, dad.
#unknown I'm home.
#unknown Oh, okay.
#unknown I'll be right out.
#unknown Hey, you go to work today? You were out late last night.
#unknown Huh? I Well, I, uh I, uh, I guess I just lost track of time.
#unknown Hello?  Dad.
#unknown Huh? I'm, um, I'm gonna head out, okay? Where you going? Uh, Aunt Marie just called.
#unknown She, uh, she wants me to help her with some computer thing and asked me to stay for dinner.
#unknown That cool? Uh, I guess that, uh Cool.
#unknown All right.
#unknown See you later.
#unknown Wait, uh Son? Junior? Hang on a second.
#unknown Yeah? Oh, good.
#unknown Come on back inside.
#unknown What happened? Oh, this? Nothing.
#unknown No, I'm fine.
#unknown It's fine.
#unknown Really.
#unknown I do wanna talk to you, though.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Are you okay? Yeah.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Sit down for a second.
#unknown I just don't wanna keep things from you, okay? I mean, you deserve to know what's happening.
#unknown Yesterday I passed out.
#unknown Briefly.
#unknown Very very briefly.
#unknown And I did this.
#unknown Why why did you pass out? Well, my latest scans show a little shadow on my lung.
#unknown But my doctor put me right on a new round of chemo, which is why I've been so tired lately.
#unknown But I I was pushing myself too hard.
#unknown I know it.
#unknown I just don't want you to worry.
#unknown I learned my lesson.
#unknown Well, um, what's the What now? What now is that we go on.
#unknown Like always.
#unknown Right? Hey, don't worry about this, okay? I know that's hard.
#unknown But I beat this once.
#unknown There's no reason to think I won't again.
#unknown And my doctor says I'm doing great.
#unknown I'm responding really well to the treatment.
#unknown And I'm I'm feeling very very good about this, all right? And what would really help me out is if we all stayed positive.
#unknown Can we do that? Yeah? Hmm? Okay.
#unknown So why don't you go on and help your Aunt Marie, and and we'll talk about this later with your mom.
#unknown No.
#unknown No no way.
#unknown I'm staying.
#unknown I'm not leaving.
#unknown Flynn's not with you, is he?  No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Why would he be? How'd it go? That bad, huh? How bad are we talking, Hank? I didn't tell them.
#unknown Why not? It's just not time yet.
#unknown No, it's past time.
#unknown Way past time.
#unknown We talked about this.
#unknown You've got to tell them now.
#unknown It's just gonna be worse if they find out that you've kept this from them.
#unknown Look, it's just I've got some things I gotta chase down.
#unknown What? What things? Leads, you know.
#unknown What leads? What? Something new? I'm not keeping anything from anybody, Marie, okay? Jesus.
#unknown Don't tell me how to do my job.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Are you sure about this? It's the only way.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'm ready.
#unknown My name is Walter Hartwell White.
#unknown I live at Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
#unknown This is my confession.
#unknown They're here.
#unknown Thank you for coming.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'll start.
#unknown Skyler and I Welcome to Garduno's! My name's Trent.
#unknown I'll be taking care of you today.
#unknown Can I start anybody off with some beverages? Margarita? How about some of our tableside guacamole? I I think we're fine.
#unknown We need some time with the menu.
#unknown No worries.
#unknown Be right back with some water.
#unknown So you here to confess? There's nothing to confess.
#unknown We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.
#unknown Flynn and Holly should be living with us.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown And while we respect your opinion, we think that your concern is misplaced.
#unknown Skyler and I feel due to Marie's attempt to lure him to your house I wasn't trying to lure him.
#unknown Regardless of what you might call it, Skyler and I would like to ask you to please leave our children out of this.
#unknown Junior has been through a lot already this year.
#unknown You are just This investigation, Hank Do you realize what this will do to him? Hearing these things? He's gonna hear it when I kick in your front door and arrest you.
#unknown If that day ever comes, so be it.
#unknown You have no evidence to support your claims.
#unknown Why tear this family apart? So, how about that guacamole? We make it right here at the table.
#unknown I'll just give you guys a few more minutes.
#unknown How can you sit there and listen to this? All we want is for those kids to be safe.
#unknown You are putting them in danger, keeping them under the same roof as this They are safe, Marie.
#unknown You yourself sent them out of the house.
#unknown And I brought them back.
#unknown Look, whatever you think he did, this is not an ongoing situation.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown No.
#unknown They need to understand.
#unknown It's in the past.
#unknown It's over.
#unknown There is nothing to go after here.
#unknown There's nothing to accomplish.
#unknown How can we believe anything you say? There's no telling where the lies begin and end.
#unknown That affair of yours? Did that even happen? Please.
#unknown Look, Junior just found out that my cancer is back.
#unknown He's already facing the idea of living without his father.
#unknown To put this on top of that? It's just not right.
#unknown I swear to God, you start throwing the word "right" at me What I mean Was it right to run a drug empire? There is no drug empire.
#unknown Lying to your son, to all of us is that right? What do I have to do to make you believe me? Why don't you kill yourself, Walt? What? Just kill yourself.
#unknown This whole thing dies with you, right? That's what you're saying here? Is that Hank should just let it go and wait for you to die.
#unknown Well, maybe you should just go ahead and die then.
#unknown That is not a solution.
#unknown No, it's not a solution.
#unknown He's not getting off that easy.
#unknown Jesus, Hank.
#unknown And the same goes for you if you stick with him.
#unknown Both of you think you're just gonna walk away from this thing? Never gonna happen.
#unknown That is not what we're saying Enough with the bullshit.
#unknown You're not gonna negotiate your way out of this thing.
#unknown There's only one solution step up, be a man, and admit what you've done.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown There is no other option.
#unknown Let's go.
#unknown My name is Walter Hartwell White.
#unknown I live at Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.
#unknown This is my confession.
#unknown If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw, Hank Schrader.
#unknown Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist.
#unknown Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA.
#unknown I was astounded.
#unknown I I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of.
#unknown I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family.
#unknown Hank took me on a ridealong and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make.
#unknown And I was weak.
#unknown I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed.
#unknown Hank had a partner, a businessman, named Gustavo Fring.
#unknown Hank sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family.
#unknown I didn't know where to turn.
#unknown Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out, and things escalated.
#unknown Fring was able to arrange, uh, I guess I guess you call it a hit on Hank, and failed, but he was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000.
#unknown Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge.
#unknown Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring.
#unknown The bomb that he used was built by me.
#unknown And he gave me no option in that.
#unknown I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward.
#unknown I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened.
#unknown Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA to keep me in line, he took my children.
#unknown For three months he kept them.
#unknown My wife, who had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done.
#unknown I was in hell.
#unknown I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family.
#unknown Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this.
#unknown I can't take this anymore.
#unknown I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family.
#unknown I All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.
#unknown Who do you think he's shown this to? No one.
#unknown It's a threat.
#unknown It's what he will do if I don't back off.
#unknown I think you should show this to Ramey.
#unknown Just get ahead of it.
#unknown That video is a bunch of lies, Hank.
#unknown Anybody who knows you will know.
#unknown $177,000? Hell's he talking about? Marie? They told me it was gambling money.
#unknown What was gambling money? Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.
#unknown Oh, God, no.
#unknown How was I supposed to know? How was I supposed to know where it really came from? Why were they paying for my medical bills? What about my insurance? Insurance wouldn't have covered the treatment that you needed, and I I just wanted the best for you.
#unknown Why didn't you tell me? Because I knew that you would refuse it, and without it, you may never have been able to walk again.
#unknown Oh, Christ, Marie.
#unknown You killed me here.
#unknown I mean, it's the that's the last nail.
#unknown That's the last nail in the coffin.
#unknown What do we do? If I were you, I'd be more nervous.
#unknown Ugh.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown It's always a desert.
#unknown Uh, I already checked it.
#unknown It's clean.
#unknown I wouldn't have driven it here if it wasn't.
#unknown Um, get one of these, by the way.
#unknown Reads radio signals.
#unknown Much easier.
#unknown What does he know? I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.
#unknown But I figure not much else, otherwise, you know, you'd be locked up.
#unknown What did he say, exactly? He wants me to inform on you for him.
#unknown Tell him everything we did.
#unknown Anything else? I don't think he's told the rest of the DEA.
#unknown Why do you say that? Just him being there all by himself, and plus he was acting kinda shady.
#unknown Seemed like he didn't want the other cops hearing what he had to say.
#unknown Are we gonna talk about the rain of caca the kid brought down upon us? Do you want to hazard a guess what his little charity drive cost you? Why don't you go take a walk, Saul? Jesse, will you let me help you? I don't like to see you hurting like this.
#unknown Maybe it's time for a change.
#unknown What kinda change? I don't know.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Maybe Maybe it's time for you to just leave all of this behind.
#unknown Just get out of town.
#unknown Don't look back.
#unknown Saul knows a man.
#unknown He specializes in giving people new identities.
#unknown He would move you someplace far away and set you up with a whole new life.
#unknown Yeah, I know.
#unknown Sounds a little extreme.
#unknown But maybe it's exactly what you need.
#unknown You know, I really think that would be good for you.
#unknown A clean slate.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Just think about it.
#unknown You get a job.
#unknown Something legitimate.
#unknown Something you like.
#unknown Meet a girl.
#unknown Start a family, even.
#unknown Hell, you're still so damn young.
#unknown And what's here for you now anyway? I tell ya.
#unknown If I could, I'd trade places.
#unknown A whole lifetime ahead of you with a chance to hit the reset button.
#unknown In a few years, this might all feel like nothing more than a bad dream.
#unknown Would you just, for once, stop working me? What are you talking about? Can you just, uh, stop working me for, like, ten seconds straight? Stop jerking me around? Jesse, I am not working you.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes, you are.
#unknown All right? Just drop the whole concerned dad thing and tell me the truth.
#unknown I mean, you're you're acting like me leaving town is is all about me and turning over a new leaf, but it's really it's really about you.
#unknown I mean, you need me gone, 'cause your dickhead brotherinlaw is never gonna let up.
#unknown Just say so.
#unknown Just ask me for a favor.
#unknown Just tell me you don't give a shit about me, and it's either this it's either this or you'll kill me the same way you killed Mike.
#unknown I mean, isn't that what this is all about? Huh? Us meeting way the hell out here? In case I say no? Come on.
#unknown Just tell me you need this.
#unknown Your change.
#unknown And if you'll hand this to your car wash professional, and have an A1 day.
#unknown Skyler? Skyler, I've got my chemo in about 45 minutes.
#unknown Can you take over the register for me? Skyler? It worked and we're fine.
#unknown Okay? We're fine.
#unknown _ So, Palmer and Castanares are sitting on that jerkoff Saul Goodman's office, keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I put them on it.
#unknown You wanna explain that to me? Yeah.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Why the hell should I know anything? They're just my guys, after all.
#unknown You gotta tell me what's going on.
#unknown Pinkman is APD's problem, not ours.
#unknown You got a history with this kid.
#unknown He catches wind that you're trailing him, and this explodes, he could sue.
#unknown Look, if I can't explain this to Ramey, I gotta pull my guys.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Take them off.
#unknown I said take them off.
#unknown What else you want? I'm going out for awhile.
#unknown Well, you have that 3:00.
#unknown Will you be back? You know what? It's gonna have to be another day.
#unknown Reschedule it.
#unknown Last chance.
#unknown You sure there's nobody you wanna say bye to? Nobody at all? No.
#unknown This is it.
#unknown Once I make the call, there's no takebacks.
#unknown Uh, I need a new dust filter for my Hoover Max Extract PressurePro, model 60.
#unknown Can you help me with that? Yeah.
#unknown Pickup.
#unknown He's hot.
#unknown Uh, not hot hot, just a little hot.
#unknown Currently out on bail.
#unknown Yeah, he knows the rules.
#unknown One hour.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown He'll be there.
#unknown And done.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown This guy's fee is one twentyfive.
#unknown Your benefactor asked me to send you out with something extra.
#unknown Get you started, you know? Keep you sitting pretty until you get into the groove of your new life.
#unknown Provided, of course, you don't toss it out the window on the way.
#unknown Seriously, this is the last of it, so you might wanna think about making a budget.
#unknown Hey, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? You can't fire up a doob in here! Put that out! I mean it! Put it out! Look, Mr.
#unknown Natural, I'm not gonna let you sabotage this thing.
#unknown This guy is not gonna take you if you show up high, so stop screwing around, or it's both our asses.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Well, that's a start.
#unknown Now give with the dope.
#unknown Christ.
#unknown Some people are immune to good advice.
#unknown I'm gonna get a bag for this cash.
#unknown Don't even think about lighting up again.
#unknown Francesca, we got any bags? For money.
#unknown Moneysized bags.
#unknown Huell's gonna drop you at the pickup spot then he's gonna get the hell out of there.
#unknown You got that? Guy won't pick up the kid if he's got company.
#unknown You got a phone? Cops took it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown In case something goes wrong guy doesn't show, whatever you give me a call.
#unknown Seriously? Hello Kitty? "Seriously?" It's free.
#unknown Uh, we got a beggarschoosers situation here, so stop busting my balls.
#unknown Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.
#unknown You, you're gonna sit and wait.
#unknown This guy's punctual with a capital P.
#unknown Okay? So don't move.
#unknown Don't get up and get an ice cream.
#unknown Just stay put like a good boy.
#unknown He'll pick you up.
#unknown You'll pay him.
#unknown He'll take your ID.
#unknown He'll give you a new one.
#unknown Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Hello, Mr.
#unknown Credit to Society.
#unknown So, do I get to pick where I go? Well, it's your life.
#unknown I imagine you get a say.
#unknown Want a suggestion? How about Florida? You get a tan, meet the Swedish bikini team, you know, swim with the dolphins.
#unknown What about Alaska? Alaska.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, that's a different vibe.
#unknown I never figured you for a big moose lover, but whatever floats your boat.
#unknown Alaska.
#unknown Alaska's good.
#unknown Anywhere you can get a fresh start is gonna be good.
#unknown You ready? Yeah.
#unknown Take care, Jesse.
#unknown All right.
#unknown 'Scuse me.
#unknown Hey, man, you can't go in there! He a noshow? Why didn't you call? Why didn't you Stop! Code Red!  Huell!  No! Hey!  Hey! No!  Get in here! No, no.
#unknown Back off! You, stay where you are.
#unknown What? I don't know what happened here.
#unknown What did I do? You stole it off of me.
#unknown You and him you took it right out of my pocket, didn't you? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Calm down.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I had Huell lift your dope.
#unknown I told you I couldn't risk the guy not taking you.
#unknown No! Before! The cigarette! You stole the cigarette.
#unknown What?  The ricin cigarette! You had him steal it off of me! And all for that asshole Mr.
#unknown White! He poisoned Brock! He poisoned Brock, and you you helped him!  Okay, Jesse.
#unknown Calm down.
#unknown Say it again! Tell me one more time to calm down! Come on! I'm sorry.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I had Huell lift your cigarette, but Walt made me! He told me he was helping you, he was saving you.
#unknown I never would've agreed to it if I'd known what he was gonna do.
#unknown Jesse, you gotta believe me.
#unknown I didn't want any of this! Back up! Agh! Get off me! What do I pay you for? Hey, it's me.
#unknown We got a big problem.
#unknown 18, 19, and 20.
#unknown Actually, you gave me a five, not a one.
#unknown Oh, I I did.
#unknown I'm I'm so sorry.
#unknown Um, here you go.
#unknown Thank you for your honesty.
#unknown Oh, and, uh, please give this to your car wash professional.
#unknown Have an A1 day.
#unknown God.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown What's going on?  Not much.
#unknown Yeah? Nothing?  No.
#unknown Things are fine.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Why? Oh, no reason.
#unknown You know what I found the other day is that the the the latch on the soda machine wasn't latching.
#unknown It's it's catching every time that I stock that darn thing.
#unknown So I thought I'd check it out.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Oh! Exact change.
#unknown I like that.
#unknown Thank you very much.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown And please give this to your car care professional, and have an A1 day.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You know what I just remembered is that they gave me a prescription to go pick up.
#unknown So I forgot.
#unknown I'm gonna go head on over to the drugstore, okay?  Yeah.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown _
