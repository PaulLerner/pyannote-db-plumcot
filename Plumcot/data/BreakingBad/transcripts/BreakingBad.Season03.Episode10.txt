#unknown No, it's not that.
#unknown It's our output.
#unknown We're off.
#unknown We're .
#unknown 14% off.
#unknown Point onefour, that's what, like What does that mean? It means we should be netting more than we're netting.
#unknown So how far off are we? It's not negligible.
#unknown Ballparking it, I'd say we're quarter to a half a pound shy.
#unknown That's weird.
#unknown What about spillage? Spillage? Yeah, you know, like, just stuff gets spilled.
#unknown Nothing gets spilled.
#unknown A little maybe.
#unknown Nothing gets spilled.
#unknown What about evaporation? It wouldn't account for this much.

#unknown Condensation? Yeah.
#unknown No.
#unknown What about the crap that gets left behind, you know, all the gunk we scrape out of the vats? I add up, like, a gallon each.

#unknown You little bastard.
#unknown Shut the door! My ears are popping.
#unknown Shut the door.
#unknown Move.
#unknown It's like I'm on an airplane, yo.
#unknown What the hell's doing that? Positive pressure.
#unknown Positive what? God, friggin' kills, yo.
#unknown Well, just move your jaw around.
#unknown Move it around.
#unknown I am moving it around.
#unknown It's not working.
#unknown Then just yawn or something.
#unknown Stop acting like such a baby.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown WWWhat positive? Positive what? Pressure.
#unknown I've turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out.
#unknown There's been a contamination.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown What? Whoa whoa whoa, hey, hold up.
#unknown Something got into the lab.
#unknown So what do we do? I mean, do we Wait.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown I mean, shouldn't we be wearing masks? No, no, it's not that that kind of contaminant.
#unknown So it's, like, not dangerous? Mr.
#unknown White, talk to me here.
#unknown Not to us particularly.
#unknown No.
#unknown What the hell is that? This is, uh I made it.
#unknown So exactly what kind of contaminant are we dealing with here? A fly.
#unknown What do you mean? A fly, like like what do you mean? I mean a fly, a house fly.
#unknown Like, uh, one fly? Singular? What did it do? It got into the lab, and I'm trying to get it out.
#unknown Okay? Understand? No, man, not really.
#unknown I can't say that I'm really following you here.
#unknown Dude, you scared the shit out of me.
#unknown I mean, when you say it's contamination, I mean, I'm thinking, like an Ebola leak or something.
#unknown Ebola? Yeah, it's a disease on The Discovery Channel, where all your intestines sort of just slip right out of your butt.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown I know wt Ebola is.
#unknown Uhhuh.
#unknown Now, tell me.
#unknown What would a WestAfrican virus be doing in our lab? Hmm? So you're chasing around a fly, and in your world I'm the idiot.
#unknown Jesse, listen.
#unknown This fly any fly cannot be in our lab.
#unknown It's It's a problem.
#unknown It's a contamination, and that is in no way a misuse of the word.
#unknown Okay? So in terms of keeping our cook clean and our product unadulterated, we need to take this.
#unknown Now do you understand? So is that your fly saber? This is a swatter.
#unknown It happens to work quite well, thank you.
#unknown Uhhuh.
#unknown Hey, what happened to your head? Nothing.
#unknown I'm fine.
#unknown You didn't hit it, like really really hard? My head is not the problem, Jesse.
#unknown The fly is the problem.
#unknown You didn't happen to maybe try our product, did you? Jess I know this seems unusual to you, a layman.
#unknown A fly I get it seems insignificant, right? But trust me.
#unknown In a highly controlled environment such as this anyollutant no matter how small could completely Hello.
#unknown What? Were you here all night? Have you even slept? No.
#unknown Jesse, look.
#unknown I'm fine.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Will you just please focus Okay, look.
#unknown We're running late, so let's just get started.
#unknown Shall we? The sooner we do it, the sooner we're done.
#unknown Frickin' finally.
#unknown Whoa.
#unknown Whoa, whoa, whoa.
#unknown What are you doing? It's time to alkaline.
#unknown Have you not heard a word I said? No cooking until this fly is dealt with.
#unknown Have I been speaking to self? The mer went off, yo.
#unknown How long is this batch going to be good for? An hour? Two? The batch will be good for nothing if we don't clear the contaminant.
#unknown Clear the contaminant? We're making meth here, not space shuttles.
#unknown We're making nothing until we catch this fly.
#unknown What fly? Where the hell is this fly? Not like I've even seen the thing.
#unknown Maybe your positive pressure blew it out the door or something.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown It is here.
#unknown It is around.
#unknown Okay? He's around, and am not going to expose this batch to the open air and contamination.
#unknown Now, you can leave me to deal with this myself, or you can help me, but you are right.
#unknown We are running out of time, so I need your answer right now.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hey, ticktock.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown Look, I like making cherry products, but let's keep it real.
#unknown All right, we make poison for people who don't care.
#unknown We probably have the most UNpicky customers in the world.
#unknown No, no, no, no, no.
#unknown No rationalizing.
#unknown We'll find it any minute now.
#unknown Don't give up.
#unknown Did you Did you know that there's an acceptable level of rat turds that can go into candy bars? That's the government, Jack.
#unknown Even the government doesn't care that much about quality.
#unknown You know what is okay to put in hotdogs? Huh? Pig lips and assholes, but I say, hey, have at it, bastard, because I love hotdogs, and, you know, see what I'm What are you doing? Oh.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Look, let me just top it off, all right, really quick.
#unknown A little sodium hydroxide, shut the lid, No harm done.
#unknown Then we're golden.
#unknown It stays closed.
#unknown That's an order.
#unknown You can't order shit, Adolf.
#unknown We're 5050 partners.
#unknown Remember? Ow! God, what is your problem, bro? Freakin' psycho.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Oh, God, it, like, hit bone.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown You see it, right? You see it? Yeah.
#unknown Get it.
#unknown You want me to get it? Yes.
#unknown Whoa, whoa, whoa.
#unknown Slow.
#unknown Move slowly.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I'm moving slowly, yeah.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown I'm just going to need your swatter thing.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown It's okay, come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Make it count.
#unknown Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna I'm going to make it count, all right.
#unknown Ok.
#unknown Now.
#unknown On three.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown One Ow! Yeah.
#unknown You like that? Hurts, huh? Did you get it? I think so, yeah.
#unknown Where is it? I don't know.
#unknown It doesn't matter.
#unknown Who cares? I got it.
#unknown Oh, Jesus, seriously? Where is it? It's, uh, right there.
#unknown Look.
#unknown Look.
#unknown See? I told you I got it.
#unknown This is a raisin.
#unknown Look, I definitely got it, man.
#unknown All right Oh, man.
#unknown He's got some skills, yo.
#unknown I'll give him that.
#unknown Look I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you, but once more I shall try.
#unknown This fly is a major problem for us.
#unknown It will ruin our batch.
#unknown Now, we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook.
#unknown Failing that we're dead.
#unknown There is no more room for error.
#unknown Not with these people.
#unknown All right, how about we go get some air? Get some air? Your answer to "We're sliding headfirst into a massive crap " Mister Mr.
#unknown White, I understand that the fly is a serious thing.
#unknown Now, all right? I'm on board.
#unknown I'm just saying maybe if we went and got some air, it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it.
#unknown Then come back down here and subtract his ass.
#unknown Oh, wait, do you have your keys? Yeah.
#unknown You're sure? Last thing we need is to get locked out.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Hey! If you're not going to help me, stay out of my way! Hey! Yo.
#unknown Yo, does somebody have an ax I can use? El axo! Peligroso! El axo! There we go.
#unknown Say good night.
#unknown Son of a bitch! Son of a Shit! Damn it! Where in the hell is that What the hell? Need some juice maybe? Knock yourself out.
#unknown It's a real one.
#unknown Yeah, like yours was working.
#unknown No, no No, no Look, we're trying to decontaminate.
#unknown You don't decontaminate by contaminating further.
#unknown What the hell is all this? Here, how about this? "Nontoxic glue strips.
#unknown " Yeah, baby, it's got pheromones.
#unknown I got a buttload.
#unknown We hang them up all over the place.
#unknown It won't be able to resist.
#unknown I sure hope we have enough.
#unknown I'm going to go out on a limb and say yeah.
#unknown Do you see him? How long do you think you've been awake? Why do you keep asking me that? Just figure you could use some coffee, is all.
#unknown I know I could.
#unknown How about it? Yeah.
#unknown You take cream and sugar? Black is fine.
#unknown Why don't you just leave him be? Let the traps do the work.
#unknown These pheromones are supposed to kick ass.
#unknown I bet we catch this mofo any second.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You ever have, like, a wild animal trapped our house? Not that I can recall, no.
#unknown We did, this one time, back when it was my aunt's house, back before she died of cancer.
#unknown Possum.
#unknown Big, freakylooking bitch.
#unknown Hey, since when did they change it to "opossum"? What's up with that? I mean, when I was coming up, it was just "possum.
#unknown " "Opossum" makes it sound like he's Irish or something.
#unknown Why they gotta go changing everything? Whatever.
#unknown They're just big rats anyways, giant pinktailed rats with their pink rat faces, totally freaky, like alien rats.
#unknown Actually, it's not so much that he got trapped, but he was living there under the house.
#unknown You could hear him going from, like, room to room, always scurrying around.
#unknown Sometimes I'd see him outside at night, and he would just, you know, freeze.
#unknown And it's like you're not looking right at it.
#unknown Right? I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.
#unknown That's what they do.
#unknown They play dead or whatever.
#unknown It's just so lame.
#unknown Is there a discernible point to this story, a point that you'll be arriving at sometime in the near future? It was just a total bitch to get out.
#unknown It took forever.
#unknown A guy came, set all these traps and all, and he finally got it, but my aunt, she didn't believe it.
#unknown She kept insisting she could still hear the thing.
#unknown I mean, you could not tell her any different.
#unknown She started keeping an old umbrella by her chair.
#unknown Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it, even gave it a name.
#unknown It was, uh, Sc Scrabble.
#unknown Yeah, that was it.
#unknown "Scrabble, just knock it off.
#unknown " Bang, bang, bang.
#unknown She got like that toward the end.
#unknown Got obsessive about stuff, just got mad about stuff.
#unknown We didn't know what was up.
#unknown It wasn't like her to be that way.
#unknown But it turned out that the the cancer had spread to her brain, and that was why.
#unknown It metastasized.
#unknown But it was good that that was when we decided to take her to the doctor because then we knew what was up and got her some treatment and meds so she wasn't stressing all the time.
#unknown It was a lot better after that.
#unknown She was a lot happier.
#unknown Where the hell is he? I've been to my oncologist, Jesse, just last week.
#unknown I'm still in remission.
#unknown I'm healthy.
#unknown Okay, so good.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Well, no end in sight.
#unknown Well, I missed it.
#unknown There was some perfect moment, and it passed me right by.
#unknown Yeah, I had to have enough to leave them.
#unknown That was the whole point.
#unknown None of this makes any sense if I didn't have enough.
#unknown But it had to be before she found out Skyler.
#unknown It had to be before that.
#unknown Perfect moment For what? To drop dead? What, are you saying you want to die? I'm saying I've lived too long.
#unknown You want them to actually miss you.
#unknown You know? You want their memories of you to be But she just won't understand.
#unknown She just No matter how well I explain it, these days she just has this this I mean, I truly believe there exists some combination of words.
#unknown There must exist certain words in a certain, specific order that would explain all of this, but with her I just I just can't ever seem to find them.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, how about you just sit down? I was thinking maybe before the fugue state, but before the fugue state they didn't have enough money, so no, not then.
#unknown And plus my daughter wasn't born yet.
#unknown It had to be Afr Holly was born.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White Definitely before the surgery.
#unknown Oh, Christ.
#unknown That damn second cell one.
#unknown How could I possibly Ah, I know the moment.
#unknown It was the night Jane died.
#unknown And we needed diapers, and so I said I'd go, but it was just an excuse.
#unknown Actually, that was the night I I brought you your money, remember? Yeah, I remember.
#unknown But afterward I stopped at a bar.
#unknown It was odd.
#unknown I never do that, go to a bar alone.
#unknown I just walked in, sat down.
#unknown I never told you.
#unknown That you went to a bar? I sit down, and this man, this stranger, he engages me in conversation.
#unknown Now, he's a complete stranger.
#unknown But he turns out to be Jane's father, Donald Margolis.
#unknown What are you talking about? Of course I didn't know it at the time.
#unknown I mean, it was just some guy in a bar.
#unknown Didn't put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news.
#unknown Jane's dad.
#unknown I mean, think of the odds.
#unknown Once I tried to calculate them, but they're astronomical.
#unknown I mean, think of the odds of me going in, sitting down that night in that bar next to that man.
#unknown What did you talk about? Oh, water on Mars.
#unknown Family.
#unknown What about family? I told him that I had a daughter, and he told me he had one, too.
#unknown Then he said, "Never give up on family.
#unknown " And I didn't.
#unknown I I took his advice.
#unknown The universe is random.
#unknown It's not inevitable.
#unknown It's simple chaos.
#unknown It's subatomic particles in endless, aimless collision.
#unknown That's what science teaches us, but what is this saying? What is it telling us, when on the very night that this man's daughter dies, it's me who's having a drink with him? How can that be random? Hey, listen, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Hey Hey, sit down.
#unknown No No.
#unknown No, it's Oh.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown No, that that was the moment.
#unknown That night.
#unknown I should never have left home.
#unknown Never gone to your house.
#unknown Maybe things would have Oh, thought I was I was at home watching TV.
#unknown Some Some nature program about elephants.
#unknown Skyler and Holly were in another room.
#unknown I could hear them on the baby monitor.
#unknown She was singing a lullaby.
#unknown Ah If had just lived right up to that moment and not one second more that would've been perfect.
#unknown He's not coming down.
#unknown Must be Thailandhot up there.
#unknown That's why he likes it.
#unknown Thailand's hot, right? Yeah.
#unknown See? That's why.
#unknown Oh, Jesus.
#unknown Hey, wait.
#unknown Here.
#unknown He's not coming down.
#unknown He's staying up there forever.
#unknown What are you What are you doing? What do you think? I'm going to get that bitch.
#unknown Uh No, you're going to break your neck.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Just No, seriously, you're This is a bad idea.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Just hold onto it.
#unknown Hold it still? Jesse.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Sorry for what? Being a lunatic? I'm sorry about Jane.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Me, too.
#unknown No, I mean, uh I'm very sorry.
#unknown It's not your fault.
#unknown But it's not mine either.
#unknown It's no one's fault, not even hers.
#unknown Sucker's just sitting there.
#unknown We are who we are, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown You know, just two junkies with a duffel bag full of cash.
#unknown Like you said, we both would've been dead within a week.
#unknown But I miss her, though.
#unknown God, I do.
#unknown Jesse, come down.
#unknown Wait, I am so close.
#unknown Let it go.
#unknown We need to cook.
#unknown What about the contamination? It's all contaminated.
#unknown I definitely scared him.
#unknown Probably stay out of our way God.
#unknown Yeah! Zap! Somebody got got, yo! You see that, Mister Bins are packed? Bins are packed.
#unknown How's the yield? Twoohtwo and change.
#unknown You okay getting home? Yeah.
#unknown Better.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown MaÃ±ana, then.
#unknown Jesse, come here.
#unknown I couldn't chance saying it inside.
#unknown For all I know, the lab's wired for sound.
#unknown That half a pound that I said we're off by Now, I'm not accusing you, but if You understand? And if they ever found out I didn't take shit.
#unknown I'm just saying that I won't be able to protect you.
#unknown Who's asking you to?
