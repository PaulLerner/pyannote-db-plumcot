jesse_pinkman  Bad His name is Jessy dad, and you don't know the first thing about him. You're going back to rehab, today. I have a daughter. Family. Can't give up on them. 201. 6 Better over than under. What are you? Running a charity? Maybe I know a whole new market. Maybe all's we need is the map. The yield, come on. Surprised he doesn't make us do that.
jesse_pinkman  The pack totally has a pecking order.
jesse_pinkman  And the head Hyena, he's the man. All
jesse_pinkman  All the other ones have to, like, kiss his ass. I
jesse_pinkman  I mean, literally.
jesse_pinkman  It's so gross. They
jesse_pinkman  They have to lick his junk.
jesse_pinkman  III can't believe they even showed it on TV.
jesse_pinkman  Yo, if this is supposed to be all, like, Major League and all, we should have equipment maintainer guys.
jesse_pinkman  And water boys. You know?
jesse_pinkman  Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.
jesse_pinkman  Get us a couple flunkies in here.
jesse_pinkman  us right.
jesse_pinkman  Okay, 15 hours starts now.
jesse_pinkman  I'm going to hit it, if that's cool with you.
walter_white  I don't understand. What
jesse_pinkman  What?
walter_white  These numbers, they just don't add up.
jesse_pinkman  Told you. Dude's
jesse_pinkman  Dude's totally boning us.
walter_white  No, it's not that.
walter_white  It's our output. We're
walter_white  We're off.
walter_white  We're
walter_white  14% off.
jesse_pinkman  Point onefour,
jesse_pinkman  that's what,
jesse_pinkman  like What does that mean?
walter_white  means we should be netting more than we're netting.
jesse_pinkman  So how far off are we?
walter_white  It's not negligible.
walter_white  Ballparking it, I'd say we're quarter to a half a pound shy
jesse_pinkman  That's weird.
jesse_pinkman  What about spillage?
walter_white  Spillage?
jesse_pinkman  you know, like, just stuff gets spilled.
walter_white  Nothing gets spilled.
jesse_pinkman  little maybe.
walter_white  Nothing gets spilled
jesse_pinkman  What about evaporation?
walter_white  It wouldn't account for this much.
walter_white  The materials aren't out that long.
jesse_pinkman  What about the other one
jesse_pinkman  The drops, like on
jesse_pinkman  on that, like, cold beer.
walter_white  Condensation?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah.
jesse_pinkman  What about the crap that gets left behind,
jesse_pinkman  all the gunk we scrape out of the vats?
jesse_pinkman  I add up, like, a gallon each.
jesse_pinkman  Did you work that in?
walter_white  Yeah
jesse_pinkman  Vestiges
jesse_pinkman  Vestiges.
jesse_pinkman  Bet that's it.
jesse_pinkman  that's totally it.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, Mr. White.
jesse_pinkman  Mr. White.
jesse_pinkman  Are you okay?
walter_white  Yeah Yeah
walter_white  Yeah, why?
jesse_pinkman  you coming?
walter_white  Yeah, in a minute.
jesse_pinkman  right, see you tomorrow.
walter_white  of a Okay
walter_white  Oh
jesse_pinkman  What
jesse_pinkman  the hell's doing that? Positive pressure. Positive what? God, friggin' kills, yo.
walter_white  Well, just move your jaw around.
jesse_pinkman  I am moving it around. It's
jesse_pinkman  It's not working. Then just
walter_white  just yawn or something.
walter_white  Stop acting like such a baby.
jesse_pinkman  Damn
jesse_pinkman  Damn. WWWhat positive?
jesse_pinkman  Positive what?
walter_white  Pressure. I've
walter_white  I've turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out.
walter_white  There's been a contamination.
jesse_pinkman  Wait.
jesse_pinkman  What?
jesse_pinkman  whoa whoa, hey
jesse_pinkman  hey, hold up.
walter_white  Something got into the lab.
jesse_pinkman  So what do we do?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, do we
jesse_pinkman  Wait.
jesse_pinkman  Wait.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, shouldn't we be wearing masks?
walter_white  No, no, it's not that that kind of contaminant.
jesse_pinkman  So it's, like, not dangerous?
jesse_pinkman  Mr. White, talk to me here.
walter_white  Not to us particularly.
jesse_pinkman  the hell is that?
walter_white  This is, uh I made it.
jesse_pinkman  exactly what kind of contaminant are we dealing with here?
jesse_pinkman  What do you mean?
jesse_pinkman  fly, like like what do you mean?
walter_white  I mean a fly,
walter_white  a house
jesse_pinkman  Like, uh, one fly?
jesse_pinkman  Singular?
jesse_pinkman  What did it do?
walter_white  It got into the lab,
walter_white  and I'm trying to get it out.
walter_white  Okay? Understand
walter_white  Understand?
jesse_pinkman  No, man, not really. I can't
jesse_pinkman  can't say that I'm really following you here.
jesse_pinkman  you scared the shit out of me.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, when you say it's contamination, I mean, I'm thinking, like an Ebola leak or something.
walter_white  Ebola?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, it's a disease on The Discovery Channel, where all your intestines sort of just slip right out of your butt.
walter_white  Thank you. I
walter_white  I know wt Ebola is. Uhhuh.
walter_white  Now, tell me.
walter_white  What would a WestAfrican virus be doing in our lab?
jesse_pinkman  So you're chasing around a fly, and in your world I'm the idiot.
walter_white  This fly any fly cannot be in our lab.
walter_white  It's It's a problem.
walter_white  It's a contamination,
walter_white  and that is in no way a misuse of the word.
walter_white  Okay?
walter_white  So in terms of keeping our cook clean and our product unadulterated, we need to take this.
walter_white  Now do you understand?
jesse_pinkman  is that your fly saber?
walter_white  This is a swatter.
walter_white  It happens to work quite well, thank you.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, what happened to your head?
walter_white  Nothing.
walter_white  I'm fine.
jesse_pinkman  You didn't hit it, like really really hard?
walter_white  My head is not the problem, Jesse.
walter_white  The fly is the
jesse_pinkman  problem. You didn't happen to maybe try our product, did you?
walter_white  Jess I know this seems unusual to you, a layman.
walter_white  A fly I
walter_white  I get it
walter_white  seems insignificant, right?
walter_white  But trust me. In a highly controlled environment such as this anyollutant no matter how small could completely
jesse_pinkman  Hello.
jesse_pinkman  Were you here all night?
jesse_pinkman  Have you even slept?
walter_white  Jesse, look. I'm
walter_white  I'm fine. Okay.
walter_white  you just please focus Okay,
walter_white  We're running late, so let's just get started. Shall we
walter_white  The sooner we do it, the sooner we're done.
jesse_pinkman  Frickin' finally. Whoa.
walter_white  What are you
jesse_pinkman  doing? It's time to alkaline.
walter_white  Have you not heard a word I said?
walter_white  No cooking until this fly is dealt with.
walter_white  Have I been speaking to self?
jesse_pinkman  The mer went off, yo.
jesse_pinkman  How long is this batch going to be good for?
jesse_pinkman  An hour?
jesse_pinkman  Two?
walter_white  The batch will be good for nothing if we don't clear the contaminant.
jesse_pinkman  Clear the contaminant? We're
jesse_pinkman  We're making meth here, not
jesse_pinkman  not space shuttles.
walter_white  We're making nothing until we catch this fly.
jesse_pinkman  What fly?
jesse_pinkman  Where the hell is this fly? Not
jesse_pinkman  Not like I've even seen the thing.
jesse_pinkman  Maybe your positive pressure blew it out the door or something.
walter_white  No, no. It is here. It
walter_white  It is around. Okay?
walter_white  He's around, and am not going to expose this batch to the open air and contamination. Now
walter_white  Now, you can leave me to deal with this myself, or you can help me,
walter_white  but you are right. We
walter_white  We are running out of time,
walter_white  so I need your answer right now.
walter_white  Okay.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, ticktock. Yo.
jesse_pinkman  Look, I like making cherry products, but let's keep it real. All
jesse_pinkman  All right, we make poison for people who don't care.
jesse_pinkman  We probably have the most UNpicky customers in the world.
walter_white  No, no, no, no, no. No
walter_white  No rationalizing.
walter_white  We'll find it any minute now
walter_white  Don't give up.
jesse_pinkman  you Did you know that there's an acceptable level of rat turds that can go into candy bars
jesse_pinkman  That's the government, Jack.
jesse_pinkman  Even the government doesn't care that much about quality.
jesse_pinkman  know what is okay to put in hotdogs? Huh
jesse_pinkman  Pig lips and assholes,
jesse_pinkman  but I say, hey, have at it, bastard, because I love hotdogs, and,
jesse_pinkman  know, see what I'm What
walter_white  What are you doing?
jesse_pinkman  Oh. Hey
jesse_pinkman  let me just top it off, all right, really quick.
jesse_pinkman  A little sodium hydroxide, shut the lid,
jesse_pinkman  No harm done.
jesse_pinkman  Then we're golden.
walter_white  It stays closed. That's
walter_white  That's an order.
jesse_pinkman  You can't order shit, Adolf. We're
jesse_pinkman  We're 5050 partners. Remember?
jesse_pinkman  God, what is your problem, bro?
jesse_pinkman  Freakin' psycho.
walter_white  Oh
jesse_pinkman  Oh, God,
jesse_pinkman  like, hit bone. Jesse
walter_white  Jesse.
walter_white  You see it,
jesse_pinkman  You see it? Yeah. Get it. You want me to get it?
walter_white  Slow.
walter_white  Move slowly. I
jesse_pinkman  know.
jesse_pinkman  moving slowly, yeah.
jesse_pinkman  Absolutely. I'm
jesse_pinkman  I'm just going to need your swatter thing. Yeah. Come on. Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on. Come on. Make it count. Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna I'm going to
jesse_pinkman  right.
jesse_pinkman  Ok.
walter_white  On three
jesse_pinkman  three.
jesse_pinkman  Okay.
walter_white  One Ow!
walter_white  You
walter_white  like that
jesse_pinkman  Hurts,
jesse_pinkman  huh?
walter_white  I
jesse_pinkman  I think so, yeah.
walter_white  Where is it? I
jesse_pinkman  I don't know. It
jesse_pinkman  It doesn't matter.
jesse_pinkman  Who cares? I
jesse_pinkman  I got it.
jesse_pinkman  Oh, Jesus, seriously?
walter_white  Where is it?
jesse_pinkman  It's, uh, right there. Look. Look
jesse_pinkman  Look.
jesse_pinkman  See
jesse_pinkman  See?
jesse_pinkman  I told you I got it.
walter_white  This is a raisin.
jesse_pinkman  Look, I definitely got it, man. All right Oh, man.
jesse_pinkman  He's got some skills, yo
jesse_pinkman  yo. I'll give him that.
walter_white  I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you, but once more I shall try.
walter_white  This fly is a major problem for us.
walter_white  It will ruin our batch.
walter_white  Now, we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook.
walter_white  Failing that we're dead.
walter_white  There is no more room for error.
walter_white  Not with these people.
jesse_pinkman  All right, how about we go get some air?
walter_white  Get some air?
walter_white  Your answer to" We're sliding headfirst into a massive crap"
jesse_pinkman  Mister Mr. White,
jesse_pinkman  I understand that the fly is a serious thing. Now,
jesse_pinkman  all right?
jesse_pinkman  I'm on board.
jesse_pinkman  I'm just saying maybe if we went and got some air, it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it.
jesse_pinkman  Then come back down here and subtract his ass.
walter_white  Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
walter_white  You're sure?
walter_white  Last thing we need is to get locked out.
jesse_pinkman  If
walter_white  you're not going to help me, stay out of my way! Hey
jesse_pinkman  Say good night.
jesse_pinkman  Son
walter_white  Damn it!
jesse_pinkman  Need some juice maybe?
jesse_pinkman  Knock yourself out.
jesse_pinkman  It's a real one.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, like yours was working.
walter_white  No, no No
walter_white  No, no Look, we're trying to decontaminate.
walter_white  You don't decontaminate by contaminating further.
walter_white  What the hell is all this?
jesse_pinkman  Here, how about this?
walter_white  Nontoxic glue strips.
jesse_pinkman " Yeah, baby,
jesse_pinkman  it's got pheromones. I
jesse_pinkman  I got a buttload. We
jesse_pinkman  We hang them up all over the place.
jesse_pinkman  It won't be able to resist.
walter_white  I sure
jesse_pinkman  have enough. I'm going to go out on a limb and say yeah.
walter_white  see him
jesse_pinkman  do you think you've been awake?
walter_white  do you keep asking me that?
jesse_pinkman  Just figure you could use some coffee, is all.
jesse_pinkman  I know I could.
jesse_pinkman  How about it?
jesse_pinkman  take cream and sugar?
jesse_pinkman  Black is fine. Why don't you just leave him be?
jesse_pinkman  the traps do the work.
jesse_pinkman  pheromones are supposed to kick ass.
jesse_pinkman  we catch this mofo any second.
jesse_pinkman  You ever have, like, a wild animal trapped our house?
walter_white  no.
jesse_pinkman  We did, this one time, back when it was my aunt's house, back before she died of cancer.
jesse_pinkman  Possum. Big, freakylooking bitch.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, since when did they change it to" opossum"
jesse_pinkman  What's up with that?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, when I was coming up, it was just" possum.
jesse_pinkman " Opossum" makes it sound like he's Irish or something.
jesse_pinkman  Why they gotta go changing everything?
jesse_pinkman  They're
jesse_pinkman  They're just big rats anyways,
jesse_pinkman  giant pinktailed rats with their pink rat faces,
jesse_pinkman  totally freaky, like alien rats.
jesse_pinkman  Actually, it's not so much that he got trapped, but he was living there under the house.
jesse_pinkman  You could hear him going from, like, room to room, always scurrying around. Sometimes
jesse_pinkman  Sometimes I'd see him outside at night, and he would just, you know, freeze.
jesse_pinkman  And it's like you're not looking right at it. Right? I
jesse_pinkman  I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.
jesse_pinkman  That's what they do.
jesse_pinkman  They play dead or whatever.
jesse_pinkman  It's just so lame.
walter_white  Is there a discernible point to this story
walter_white  point that you'll be arriving at sometime in the near future?
jesse_pinkman  just a total bitch to get out.
jesse_pinkman  It took forever. A guy
jesse_pinkman  guy came, set all these traps and all, and he finally got it
jesse_pinkman  but my aunt, she didn't believe it.
jesse_pinkman  She kept insisting she could still hear the thing.
jesse_pinkman  mean, you could not tell her any different.
jesse_pinkman  She started keeping an old umbrella by her chair.
jesse_pinkman  Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it,
jesse_pinkman  even gave it a name.
jesse_pinkman  Sc Scrabble.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, that was it.
jesse_pinkman  Scrabble, just knock it off." Bang, bang, bang.
jesse_pinkman  She got like that toward the end.
jesse_pinkman  obsessive about stuff,
jesse_pinkman  just got mad about stuff.
jesse_pinkman  We didn't know what was up.
jesse_pinkman  It wasn't like her to be that way.
jesse_pinkman  But it turned out that the the cancer had spread to her brain, and that was why.
jesse_pinkman  It metastasized.
jesse_pinkman  it was good that that was when we decided to take her to the doctor because then we knew what was up
jesse_pinkman  her some treatment
jesse_pinkman  meds so she wasn't stressing all the time.
jesse_pinkman  It was a lot better after that.
jesse_pinkman  She was a lot happier.
walter_white  Where the hell
walter_white  I've been to my oncologist, Jesse, just last week.
walter_white  I'm still in remission.
walter_white  I'm healthy.
jesse_pinkman  Okay, so good.
jesse_pinkman  Great.
walter_white  Well, no end in sight.
jesse_pinkman  it. There
walter_white  some perfect moment, and it passed me right by.
walter_white  Yeah, I had to have enough to leave them
walter_white  That was the whole point.
walter_white  None
walter_white  this makes any sense if I didn't have enough.
walter_white  it had to be before she found out
walter_white  had to be before that.
jesse_pinkman  Perfect moment For what?
jesse_pinkman  To drop dead?
jesse_pinkman  are you saying you want to die?
walter_white  I'm saying I've lived too
walter_white  long. You want them to actually miss you. You know?
walter_white  You want their memories of you to be
walter_white  she just
walter_white  just won't understand.
walter_white  She just No matter how well I explain it, these days she just has this this
walter_white  this I mean, I truly believe there exists some combination of words.
walter_white  must exist certain words in a certain, specific order that would explain all of this, but with her I just I just can't ever seem to find them.
jesse_pinkman  White, how about you just sit down
walter_white  I was thinking maybe before the fugue state, but before the fugue state they didn't have enough money,
walter_white  no, not then.
walter_white  And plus my daughter wasn't born yet.
walter_white  had to be Afr Holly was born.
jesse_pinkman  White
walter_white  Definitely before the surgery.
walter_white  damn second
walter_white  one.
walter_white  How could I possibly Ah, I know the moment. It was the night Jane died. And we needed diapers, and so I said I'd go, but it was just an excuse.
walter_white  Actually, that was the night I I brought you your money, remember?
walter_white  Yeah
walter_white  Yeah, I remember. But afterward I stopped at a bar. It was odd. I never do that, go to a bar alone.
walter_white  I just walked in, sat down.
walter_white  I never told
jesse_pinkman  That
walter_white  you went to a bar? I sit down, and this man, this stranger, he engages me in conversation.
walter_white  Now, he's a complete stranger.
walter_white  But he turns out to be Jane's father,
jesse_pinkman  Margolis. What are you talking about?
walter_white  Of course I didn't know it at the time.
walter_white  I mean, it was just some guy in a bar.
walter_white  Didn't put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news.
jesse_pinkman  Jane's dad. I
walter_white  I mean, think of
walter_white  Once I tried to calculate them, but they're astronomical.
walter_white  I mean, think of the odds of me going in, sitting down that night in that bar next to that man.
jesse_pinkman  What did
walter_white  water on Mars.
jesse_pinkman  What about family?
walter_white  I told him that I had a daughter, and he told me he had one, too.
walter_white  Then he said,
walter_white  Never give up on family.
walter_white  And I didn't.
walter_white  I
walter_white  universe is random.
walter_white  It's not inevitable. It's simple chaos.
walter_white  It's
walter_white  It's subatomic particles in endless, aimless collision.
walter_white  That's what science teaches us
walter_white  us, but what is this saying?
walter_white  What is it telling us, when on the very night that this man's daughter dies, it's me who's having a drink with him?
walter_white  How can that be random?
jesse_pinkman  Hey
walter_white  Hey, listen,
walter_white  Hey Hey, sit down. No No. No, it's Oh. Oh. No, that that was the moment.
walter_white  That night.
walter_white  I should never have left home.
walter_white  Never gone to your house.
walter_white  Maybe things would
walter_white  thought I was I was at home watching TV.
walter_white  nature program about elephants.
walter_white  Skyler and Holly were in another room.
walter_white  I could hear them on the baby monitor.
walter_white  She was singing a lullaby.
walter_white  If had just lived right up to that moment and not one second
walter_white  that would've been perfect.
jesse_pinkman  He's not coming down. Must be Thailandhot up there
jesse_pinkman  That's why he likes it.
jesse_pinkman  Thailand's hot
jesse_pinkman  See
jesse_pinkman  That's
jesse_pinkman  That's why
walter_white  He's not coming down.
walter_white  He's
walter_white  I'm going
jesse_pinkman  get that bitch
walter_white  No, you're going to break your neck. Yeah, yeah.
walter_white  seriously, you're This
walter_white  This is a bad idea.
jesse_pinkman  it.
walter_white  Jesse.
jesse_pinkman  Just hold onto it
jesse_pinkman  Hold it still
walter_white  I'm sorry
jesse_pinkman  Sorry for what? Being a lunatic?
walter_white  sorry about Jane.
jesse_pinkman  Me
jesse_pinkman  Me, too.
walter_white  I mean, uh I'm very sorry.
jesse_pinkman  It's not your fault.
jesse_pinkman  it's not mine either.
jesse_pinkman  It's no one's fault, not even hers.
jesse_pinkman  We are who we are, Mr. White.
jesse_pinkman  just two junkies with a duffel bag full of cash.
jesse_pinkman  Like you said, we both would've been dead within a week.
jesse_pinkman  miss her, though.
walter_white  Jesse,
walter_white  I am so close. Let it go.
walter_white  We need to cook.
jesse_pinkman  What about the contamination?
walter_white  It's all contaminated.
jesse_pinkman  I definitely scared
jesse_pinkman  him. Probably stay out of our way God
jesse_pinkman  Yeah! Zap! Somebody got got, yo! You
jesse_pinkman  You see that, Mister
walter_white  Bins are packed.
jesse_pinkman  How's
walter_white  How's the
jesse_pinkman  the yield? Twoohtwo and change.
jesse_pinkman  You okay getting home?
walter_white  Better
walter_white  Better.
walter_white  Thanks.
jesse_pinkman  then.
walter_white  Jesse, come here
walter_white  I couldn't chance saying it inside.
walter_white  all I know, the lab's wired for sound
walter_white  That half a pound that I said we're off by
walter_white  I'm not accusing you, but if
walter_white  understand?
walter_white  if they ever found out I
walter_white  I'm just saying that I won't be able to protect you
