#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad I need you all outside to do some wipe outs.
#unknown Wipe down this! I heard you broke new ground today.
#unknown I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes.
#unknown Yeah, I guess I broke new ground.
#unknown You worked here four years.
#unknown It's a story people would believe.
#unknown This is what we buy.
#unknown Slow down.
#unknown Oh God! At the first opportunity Gus will kill us.
#unknown So? How does it look? You mean, in do I see it? Yes.
#unknown Do you see it? Basically, any lawman worth his salt's going to spot that, yeah.
#unknown Assuming that's a deal breaker? Yes.
#unknown It's a deal breaker.
#unknown Well, if stealth is what you're aspiring to, you best go with something more compact .
#unknown 38 Special, snub nose.
#unknown Got a concealed hammer so it doesn't catch on your belt when you draw.
#unknown Tried and true, no nonsense about it.
#unknown Five shots? Yep.
#unknown Automatic has how many? Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.
#unknown If you can't get it done with five, then you're into spraying prey, in which case I wouldn't count on another six closing the deal.
#unknown You load that with 158 grain hollow points instead of your standard wad cutters.
#unknown It's got plenty of stopping power.
#unknown Can't get more dependable than a wheel gun.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Um Try it on with this.
#unknown That snub, you'll conceal real nice if you carry it IWB.
#unknown Little harder to draw from, but there's really no substitute if you're intent of fooling a vigilant eye.
#unknown Comes in polymer, too.
#unknown I prefer the feel of leather.
#unknown Old school, I guess.
#unknown Yeah, um You sure it's on the correct side? If you're righthanded, it is.
#unknown I don't know, ma Are you sure because maybe it'll feel better on the left side.
#unknown General rule You don't want to cross draw, not unless you're going to be sitting, you know, store clerks, card gamers and such.
#unknown Either way you're going to want to practice your draw a lot because if you're all fingers, well, it might could be him keeping a piece instead of you.
#unknown Catch my drift? What's this? That there is why you're going to pay me five times what you'd pay your neighborhood gun store.
#unknown Serial number has been filed off.
#unknown So to state the obvious, I don't want to be caught with this on me.
#unknown No, sir, to state the obvious, you don't.
#unknown You know, Mister, I've been providing my services for the past 30odd years.
#unknown You'd think in that time I'd learn better than to ask a man his business, especially about one referred by the lawyer, but I do feel the urge to ask you, we strictly talking defense here? Yes, absolutely defense.
#unknown Why? Because if it's just personal protection, aside from a bucket of money, you'd save yourself a potential felony twospot for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number if you'd just buy it legally.
#unknown Yeah, but if you did have to use it, wouldn't it still be better to use one that couldn't be traced? This is the west, boss.
#unknown New Mexico's not a retreat jurisdiction.
#unknown Man steps to you bent on doing bodily harm, you've got every right to plant your feet and shoot to kill.
#unknown Some call it a moral right, and I do include myself within that class.
#unknown All this to say I'm happy to take your money, but if you're not a convicted felon, you might best be advised to bear your arms within the confines of the law.
#unknown It's for defense.
#unknown Defense.
#unknown I'll take it.
#unknown Thanks, Bonnie.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown What's up, brother? Dude, it sounds like an earthquake out there.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown New sound system.
#unknown Whoa! Check it out.
#unknown Bodacious subwoofers, yo! Serious cannons.
#unknown six of them.
#unknown Aluminum columns so they're really, really like, uh, sonically neutral.
#unknown Tweeters are killers, too.
#unknown Dig all them lines jumping around.
#unknown Psychedelic.
#unknown Kind of like just want to stare at them.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Yeah, man.
#unknown Totally makes me want to crank old Savage and blaze one.
#unknown It's got, like, parametric equalization.
#unknown Automatically adjusts the levels to changes in, like, air pressure and whatnot.
#unknown It's a totally digital vacuum tube amp which is by far the best antidistortionwise.
#unknown It's 120 decibels without breaking a sweat.
#unknown Hold on to your hats, bitches.
#unknown Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting yesterday.
#unknown She asked about you.
#unknown Thanks, man, but, uh Seriously? Maybe just a little bump.
#unknown Left 4 Dead, yo, the way them bitches get all cranial when you cap them in the head.
#unknown It's like booyah! No, no, no, man.
#unknown Resident Evil 4 takes it by a long shot.
#unknown Aw, please, brother, you're fronting.
#unknown No, man, seriously.
#unknown That chick, the one you got to rescue, she's smokin', bro, and then you're, like, the last undead dude on earth, so how can you not be dipping into that? Talk about inspiring a brother to kick some zombie ass! They're trying to eat your brain, bro.
#unknown A dude don't need no more motivation.
#unknown That's a fair point, I guess.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Call of Duty, World at War Zombie mode.
#unknown Now, that's the bomb, man.
#unknown Think on it, bro.
#unknown They're not just zombies.
#unknown They're Nazi zombies.
#unknown Nazi zombies.
#unknown Yeah, man.
#unknown S.
#unknown S.
#unknown Waffen troopers, too, which are, like, the baddest ass Nazis of the whole Nazi family! Zombies are dead, man.
#unknown What difference does it make what their job was when they was living? Dude, you are so historically retarded.
#unknown Nazi zombies don't want to eat you just because they're craving the protein.
#unknown They do it because They do it because they hate Americans, man.
#unknown Talibans They're the Talibans of the zombie world.
#unknown I played the game, bro.
#unknown They ain't exactly fleet of foot.
#unknown Ohh! I'm saying where's the challenge? At least the zombies in Left 4 Dead clock a respectable 40.
#unknown You got to lead them and shit.
#unknown Dude, that's because they're not even zombies! They're just infected.
#unknown They got, like, this rage virus.
#unknown Amps them up like they've been smoking the schwag! Apples and oranges, bro.
#unknown Totally unfair to compare the two.
#unknown Yo, Jesse, where do you come out on all this? Ha ha! Ohh Agree, totally.
#unknown Did that just happen? Damn, man.
#unknown It's quiet.
#unknown You know what this This place needs? Ohh.
#unknown You okay? Fine.
#unknown Can't you sleep? Actually, yes, Marie.
#unknown This is me sleeping.
#unknown What's it look like? Looks like you're looking at a rock at2:24 in the morning.
#unknown This is not a rock.
#unknown This is a mineral, for, like, the tenth time.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Got it.
#unknown Blue corundum, to be precise.
#unknown Blue corundum.
#unknown Well, it's very pretty.
#unknown It's encrusted with igneous biotite in a mica schist.
#unknown Would you like some more detail? Because I can give it to you.
#unknown You keep acting like you give the first shit, and I'll Hank.
#unknown Found in the Central Cordillera of Irian Jaya.
#unknown Blue corundum.
#unknown I'm just saying it's 2 in the morning.
#unknown I'm justasking if maybe You know, when last I counted, Marie, there were four bedrooms in this house.

#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Walt? Hello? Walt? Um, okay, Walt, could you, uh, could you call me back, please? Hank's bills are really starting to pile up here, and, uh, in the meantime, I haven't received a check from you in quite a while, so there's that.
#unknown Uh, second order of business is, uh, is the car wash.
#unknown Ohh! God! Take the next step here.

#unknown Now you think that was wise? Proof of our what? What are you talking about? Skyler, we should not even be mentioning the words "car wash" on the phone at all, period.
#unknown Walt, it is a car wash, not a brothel.
#unknown I mean, if we can't even say what it is, why are we buying it at all? God, look, Skyler, please, just Hey, Mom.
#unknown Hey, hon.
#unknown Look, there's some cereal on the breakfast table.
#unknown I'm telling you, if you're not willing to pull the trigger on this, I am more than happy to call Goodman myself.
#unknown No, no, no, no, no.
#unknown I will handle it, okay? I could so use a brain transplant right now.
#unknown Hey, uh, I'm going to work.

#unknown Yo, what's up with the pie, man? It ain't cut.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Right.
#unknown That's the gimmick.
#unknown What gimmick? This place.
#unknown They don't cut their pizza, and they pass the savings on to you.
#unknown What savings? How much can it be to cut a damn pizza? Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro, you know? Cut your own Christmas tree.
#unknown Cut your own pizza.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's democratic.
#unknown What am I supposed to do with this? Don't sweat it, yo.
#unknown You got some, like, scissors? I will cut this bitch up good.

#unknown We'll catch up later.
#unknown Guess you know I've been calling.
#unknown Yeah, um, I'm really busy at work and Jesse, I'm not here to make you come up with excuses.
#unknown You got other things going on.
#unknown I get it.
#unknown There's just one thing you and me got to talk about.
#unknown And that's this.
#unknown After TomÃ¡s was murdered, two dudes from the block, a couple bangers he used to hang with, get run over, one of them shot in the head.
#unknown Same night, I get this in my mailbox.
#unknown This was you? You know what? Whatever it is you had to do with my brother's killers, I don't want to know.
#unknown But you got to tell me one thing.
#unknown Is someone gonna come looking for this? No.
#unknown What exactly am I supposed to do with this? Use it to get you and Brock out of that shit hole of a neighborhood.
#unknown Or you can go out and spend it on glass, and I'd have no way of stopping you.
#unknown But I got to believe you won't do that.
#unknown Go home, Walter.
#unknown How you doing? Hi.
#unknown Ton of bricks? Rocks.
#unknown You, uh, want me to wheel them inside for you? Thank you.
#unknown Marie, is that my minerals? Yes, Hank.
#unknown How many boxes? I don't know Three, four, a hundred, a million.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Did you check them for damage? Oh, my God.
#unknown They're rocks, Hank.
#unknown No, they're minerals.
#unknown Jesus, Marie, I got some geodes coming that are very delicate, all right? And I will not accept any boxes that have damage.
#unknown Those delivery jackoffs, I'm telling you I'm not getting ass raped by those bastards, all right? Just Honey, would you check? Just check, please? Hey, you, too much wax.
#unknown Stop wasting it.
#unknown Look, tell your brother that if he doesn't show up tomorrow, I'm going to have to fire him.
#unknown So now go back.
#unknown And no more excuses.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Wolynetz, my name is Skyler White.
#unknown How do you do? You want to buy my car wash.
#unknown I do.
#unknown And I am prepared to talk numbers right now, if you'd like.
#unknown Do you think this is an easy job? You are willing to get down on your hands and knees and scrub like a house maid with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin and stinging in your eyes? Well, I know a thing or two about scrubbing.
#unknown Any other advice for me? Because I am serious about this.
#unknown Good.
#unknown I am serious, too.
#unknown I have worked 30 years of building this business from nothing, with my own hands and my own sweat and blood.
#unknown I can appreciate that, truly.
#unknown So, with that in mind, is there a figure you can quote me? One which you think would adequately $10 million.
#unknown Well, let's try 879,000.
#unknown Where do you come up with this number? You pull it from your behind? On a typical day, you manage 19 cars per hour.
#unknown Extrapolating, I added the extra revenues for hand waxes and detailing, subtracted your overhead and salary and maintenance, operating fees, depreciation, which I obtained from comparable businesses in the Albuquerque area, giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here, to which I applied the industry standard multiplier and added the market value of your real estate, giving me a total estimated value of $829,000, on top of which I generously added an extra $50,000 so as not to be insulting.
#unknown $20 million.
#unknown Okay, Mr.
#unknown Wolynetz, this This is the price for Walter White.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown Oh, yes.
#unknown You don't think I know who you are? I remember.
#unknown Well, I have not pretended to be any Your husband, he quit without giving me notice.
#unknown He broke my air fresheners.
#unknown He cursed at me and grabbed himself.
#unknown And now he wants to buy my car wash.
#unknown But he's not man enough to come in here and face me himself.
#unknown Instead, he sends his woman.
#unknown Excuse me? Walter White wants to buy my car wash.
#unknown The price he pays is $20 million.
#unknown Now please leave.
#unknown Have you recently lost a loved one on an aviation disaster? Have you suffered injury, shock to the senses, or property damage as a result of airplane debris or, God forbid, falling body parts? Then call me, Saul Goodman.
#unknown It goes without saying that the six, seven, perhaps even eightfigure cash settlement that I can win for you will never fill the hole in your heart caused by your tragic loss, but you deserve justice.
#unknown So if you want to tip the scales back in your favor, better call Saul.
#unknown Saul Goodman, attorney at law.
#unknown (505)5034455.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Se habla espaÃ±ol.
#unknown You might want to learn how to tail better if you're planning on making a habit of it.
#unknown May I buy you a drink? Next round, when you're done.
#unknown Why not? You make a hell of a lot more than I do.
#unknown Uh, another round for him, and I'll have the same.
#unknown No ice.
#unknown I feel like I need to explain myself.
#unknown There were some actions that I took which I want you to understand.
#unknown I didn't want any of this to happen.
#unknown Everything I did I did out of loyalty to my partner, and then, later, of course, it was purely out of selfdefense.
#unknown I hope you can appreciate that just like I appreciated that, uh I appreciate that when you were going to kill me you were simply following orders.
#unknown I get that completely.
#unknown And I harbor no ill will.
#unknown Well, there's a load off my mind.
#unknown Mike, I'm trying to tell you I get it.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Drink up, Walter.
#unknown Hell of a last couple of weeks.
#unknown Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.
#unknown Huh.
#unknown I mean, I I cannot be alone in feeling this way.
#unknown Not after what happened to Victor.
#unknown So what's with the piece? Right hip inside your waistband.
#unknown I noticed it the other day at the lab.
#unknown You wear it if it makes you feel better, but if push comes to shove, it's not going to help.
#unknown Mike, do I have to come right out and say this? You and I, we're in the same boat.
#unknown Drink your drink.
#unknown If it happened to Victor, it could happen to you.
#unknown And And what the hell was that anyway? Hmm? A message? He cuts a man's throat just to send a message? You won, Walter.
#unknown You got the job.
#unknown Do yourself a favor and learn to take yes for an answer.
#unknown Yeah, I got the job, but for how long? Get me in a room with him.
#unknown Mike, just get me in a room, and I'll do the rest.
#unknown You done? Yeah.
#unknown Ohh! Oof! Ohh! Thanks for the drink.
#unknown Ahh.
#unknown Hey, my man, you know how to party, brother.
#unknown Epic! Epic! Uh, seriously, where are you two going? Jesse, I've been awake for, like, three straight days.
#unknown I'm turning into a Sleestak.
#unknown So crash here.
#unknown It's not like I ain't got the space.
#unknown Yeah, that's cool and all, but I think I got, like, this cat.
#unknown I think I'm, like, supposed to feed it.
#unknown Whatever, you little bitch.
#unknown What about you? You sticking, or do I got to flip you over and check you for a slizz? Bro, I'm kind of pushing flowers here, yo.
#unknown I ain't proud of it, but it's God's honest truth.
#unknown Hell, brother, you know we got man love for you.
#unknown Now that you're back in the mix, it's like nothing but good days ahead.
#unknown Plenty of time to pace it out is all I'm saying.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, man.
#unknown Totally.
#unknown I was thinking, like, next week? Yeah, sure, man.
#unknown Next week.
#unknown Are we cool? We are cool.
#unknown
