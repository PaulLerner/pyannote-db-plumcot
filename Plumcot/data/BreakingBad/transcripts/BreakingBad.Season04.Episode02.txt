walter_white  This is what we buy. Slow down. Oh God! At the first opportunity Gus will kill us. So? How does it look?
lawson  mean, in do I see it
walter_white  you see it
lawson  Basically, any lawman worth his salt's going to spot that, yeah.
lawson  Assuming that's a deal breaker?
walter_white  Yes. It's a deal breaker.
lawson  Well, if stealth is what you're aspiring to, you best go with something more compact.
lawson  38 Special,
lawson  snub nose.
lawson  Got a concealed hammer so it doesn't catch on your belt when you draw.
lawson  Tried and true,
lawson  no nonsense about it.
lawson  Five shots?
walter_white  Yep.
walter_white  Automatic has how many?
lawson  Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.
lawson  you can't get it done with five, then you're into spraying prey, in which case I wouldn't count on another six closing the deal.
lawson  You load that with 158 grain hollow points instead of your standard wad cutters. It's got plenty of
lawson  power. Can't get more dependable than a wheel gun.
lawson  it on with this.
lawson  That snub, you'll conceal real nice if you carry it IWB.
lawson  Little harder to draw from, but there's really no substitute if you're intent of fooling a vigilant eye.
lawson  Comes in polymer, too.
walter_white  I prefer the feel of leather.
lawson  Old school, I guess.
walter_white  sure it's on the correct side?
lawson  you're righthanded, it is.
walter_white  don't know, ma Are
walter_white  you sure because maybe it'll feel better on the left
lawson  General rule You don't want to cross draw,
lawson  not unless you're going to be sitting,
lawson  know, store clerks, card gamers and such.
lawson  Either way you're going to want to practice your draw
lawson  because if you're all fingers, well, it might could be him keeping a piece instead of you.
lawson  Catch my drift?
lawson  That there is why you're going to pay me five times what you'd pay your neighborhood gun store.
walter_white  Serial number has been filed off
walter_white  So to state the obvious, I don't want to be caught with this on me.
lawson  No,
lawson  sir, to state the obvious, you don't.
lawson  You know, Mister, I've been providing my services for the past 30odd years.
lawson  You'd think in that time I'd learn better than to ask a man his business, especially about one referred by the lawyer,
lawson  but I do feel the urge to ask you, we strictly talking defense here?
walter_white  Yes, absolutely defense. Why?
walter_white  Because
lawson  Because if it's just personal protection, aside from a bucket of money, you'd save yourself a potential felony twospot for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number if you'd just buy it legally.
walter_white  Yeah, but if you did have to use it, wouldn't it still be better to use one that couldn't be traced?
lawson  This is the west, boss.
lawson  New Mexico's not a retreat jurisdiction.
lawson  Man steps to you bent on doing bodily harm, you've got every right to plant your feet and shoot to kill.
lawson  Some call it a moral right, and I do include myself within that class.
lawson  All this to say I'm happy to take your money
lawson  if you're not a convicted felon, you might best be advised to bear your arms within the confines of the law.
walter_white  It's for defense. Defense.
mike_ehrmantraut  Thanks, Bonnie.
badger  Jesse. What's
skinny_pete  What's up, brother?
badger  Dude, it sounds like an earthquake out there
jesse_pinkman  New sound system.
jesse_pinkman  it out. Bodacious
badger  Bodacious subwoofers, yo!
skinny_pete  Serious cannons.
jesse_pinkman  six of them
jesse_pinkman  Aluminum columns so they're really, really like, uh, sonically neutral.
jesse_pinkman  Tweeters are killers, too.
skinny_pete  Dig all them lines jumping around. Psychedelic
skinny_pete  Psychedelic.
skinny_pete  Kind of like just want to stare at them.
badger  Yeah, man. Totally makes me want to crank old Savage and blaze one.
jesse_pinkman  It's got, like, parametric equalization.
jesse_pinkman  Automatically adjusts the levels to changes in, like, air pressure and whatnot.
jesse_pinkman  It's a totally digital vacuum
jesse_pinkman  vacuum tube amp which is by far the best antidistortionwise. It's
jesse_pinkman  It's 120 decibels without breaking a sweat.
jesse_pinkman  on to your hats, bitches.
skinny_pete  Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting yesterday.
skinny_pete  She asked about you.
skinny_pete  Thanks, man, but, uh
jesse_pinkman  Seriously?
badger  Maybe just a little bump.
skinny_pete  Left 4 Dead,
skinny_pete  bitches get all cranial when you cap them in the head. It's like booyah
badger  no, man.
badger  Resident Evil 4 takes it by a long shot. Aw,
skinny_pete  brother,
skinny_pete  you're fronting. No,
badger  man, seriously.
badger  That chick, the one you got to rescue,
badger  she's smokin', bro,
badger  and then you're, like, the last undead dude on earth, so
badger  so how can you not be dipping into that?
badger  Talk about inspiring a brother to kick some zombie ass! They're
skinny_pete  They're trying to eat your brain, bro.
skinny_pete  A dude don't need no more motivation.
badger  a fair point, I guess.
badger  Okay. Okay. Okay.
badger  Call of Duty, World at War Zombie mode.
badger  Now, that's the bomb, man.
badger  Think on it, bro.
badger  They're not just zombies. They're Nazi zombies. Nazi
skinny_pete  Nazi zombies. Yeah
badger  Yeah, man. S.
badger  S. S. Waffen troopers, too, which are, like, the baddest ass Nazis of the whole Nazi family!
skinny_pete  Zombies are dead, man. What difference does it make what their job was when they was living? Dude
badger  Dude, you are so historically retarded.
badger  Nazi zombies don't want to eat you just because they're craving the protein.
badger  They do it because They
badger  They do it because they hate Americans, man.
badger  Talibans They're
badger  They're the Talibans of the zombie world.
skinny_pete  I played the game,
skinny_pete  bro. They ain't exactly fleet of foot.
skinny_pete  I'm saying where's the challenge?
skinny_pete  At least the zombies in Left 4 Dead clock a respectable 40. You
skinny_pete  You got to lead them and
badger  Dude, that's because they're not even zombies!
badger  They're just infected. They
badger  They got, like, this rage virus. Amps them up like they've been smoking the schwag!
badger  Apples and oranges, bro.
badger  Totally unfair to compare
skinny_pete  Yo, Jesse, where do you come out on all this?

jesse_pinkman  No.
andrea_cantillo  What exactly am I supposed to do with this?
jesse_pinkman  Use it to get you and Brock out of that shit hole of a neighborhood
jesse_pinkman  Or you can go out and spend it on glass, and I'd have no way of stopping you.
jesse_pinkman  But I got to believe you won't do that.

hank_schrader  I will not accept any boxes that have damage. Those
hank_schrader  Those delivery jackoffs, I'm telling you I'm not getting ass raped by those bastards,
hank_schrader  Honey, would you check?
hank_schrader  Just check, please?
bogdan_wolynetz  Hey, you, too much wax.
bogdan_wolynetz  Stop wasting it
bogdan_wolynetz  Look, tell your brother that if he doesn't show up tomorrow, I'm going to have to fire him.
bogdan_wolynetz  So now go back.
bogdan_wolynetz  And no more excuses.
skyler_white  Mr. Wolynetz, my name is Skyler White.
bogdan_wolynetz  You want to buy my car wash.
skyler_white  I do.
skyler_white  And I am prepared to talk numbers right now, if you'd like.
bogdan_wolynetz  you think this is an easy job?
bogdan_wolynetz  You are willing to get down on your hands and knees and scrub like a house maid with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin and stinging in your eyes?
skyler_white  Well, I know a thing or two about scrubbing.
skyler_white  Any other advice for me?
skyler_white  Because I am serious about this.
bogdan_wolynetz  Good.
bogdan_wolynetz  I am serious, too.
bogdan_wolynetz  I have worked 30 years of building this business from nothing, with my own hands and my own sweat and blood.
skyler_white  I can appreciate that,
skyler_white  truly.
skyler_white  So, with that in mind, is there a figure you can quote me?
skyler_white  One which you think would adequately $10
bogdan_wolynetz  $10 million.
skyler_white  Well, let's try 879,000. Where
bogdan_wolynetz  Where do you come up with this number?
bogdan_wolynetz  You pull it from your behind?
skyler_white  On a typical day, you manage 19 cars per hour.
skyler_white  Extrapolating, I added the extra revenues for hand waxes and detailing,
skyler_white  subtracted your overhead and salary and maintenance, operating fees, depreciation, which I obtained from comparable businesses in the Albuquerque area, giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here
skyler_white  which I applied the industry standard multiplier and added the market value of your real estate,
skyler_white  giving me a total estimated value of $829,000,
skyler_white  on top of which I generously added an extra $50,000
skyler_white  so as not to be insulting.
bogdan_wolynetz  $20 million.
skyler_white  Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this This
bogdan_wolynetz  This is the price for Walter White.
bogdan_wolynetz  Oh, yes.
bogdan_wolynetz  You don't think I know who you are?
bogdan_wolynetz  I remember.
skyler_white  Well, I have not pretended to be any
bogdan_wolynetz  any Your husband,
bogdan_wolynetz  he quit without giving me notice.
bogdan_wolynetz  He broke my air fresheners. He cursed at me and grabbed himself.
bogdan_wolynetz  And now he wants to buy my car wash.
bogdan_wolynetz  But he's not man enough to come in here and face me himself.
bogdan_wolynetz  Instead, he sends his woman.
skyler_white  Excuse me? Walter
bogdan_wolynetz  Walter White wants to buy my car wash.
bogdan_wolynetz  The price he pays is $20 million.
bogdan_wolynetz  Now please leave.
saul_goodman  Have you recently lost a loved one on an aviation disaster
saul_goodman  Have you suffered injury, shock to the senses, or property damage as a result of airplane debris or, God forbid, falling body parts? Then
saul_goodman  Then call me, Saul
saul_goodman  Saul Goodman. It goes without saying that the six, seven, perhaps even eightfigure cash settlement that I can win for you will never fill the hole in your heart caused by your tragic loss, but
saul_goodman  but you deserve justice.
saul_goodman  So if you want to tip the scales back in your favor, better call Saul.
unknown  Saul
unknown  Saul Goodman, attorney at law. (505)5034455. Hmm.
unknown  Se habla espaÃ±ol.
mike_ehrmantraut  You might want to learn how to tail better if you're planning on making a habit of it.
walter_white  buy you a drink?
walter_white  Next round, when you're done
mike_ehrmantraut  Why not?
mike_ehrmantraut  You make a hell of a lot more than I do.
walter_white  another round for him, and I'll have the same.
walter_white  No ice.
walter_white  I feel like I need to explain myself.
walter_white  There were some actions that I took which I want you to understand.
walter_white  I didn't want any of this to happen.
walter_white  Everything I did I did out of loyalty to my partner
walter_white  then, later, of course, it was purely out of selfdefense.
walter_white  I hope you can appreciate
walter_white  just like I appreciated that, uh I appreciate that when you were going to kill me you were simply following orders.
walter_white  I get that completely
walter_white  completely.
walter_white  And I harbor no ill will.
mike_ehrmantraut  Well, there's a load off my mind.
walter_white  Mike, I'm trying to tell you
mike_ehrmantraut  you I get it.
mike_ehrmantraut  Fine.
mike_ehrmantraut  Drink up, Walter.
walter_white  Hell of a last couple of weeks.
walter_white  Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.
walter_white  I mean, I I cannot be alone in feeling this way
walter_white  Not after what happened to Victor.
mike_ehrmantraut  So what's with the piece?
mike_ehrmantraut  Right hip inside your waistband.
mike_ehrmantraut  I noticed it the other day at the lab.
mike_ehrmantraut  You wear it if it makes you feel better,
mike_ehrmantraut  but if push comes to shove, it's not going to help.
walter_white  Mike, do I have to come right out and say this?
walter_white  You and I, we're in the same boat.
mike_ehrmantraut  Drink your drink.
walter_white  If it happened to Victor, it could happen to you.
walter_white  And what the hell was that anyway?
walter_white  A message?
walter_white  cuts a man's throat just to send a message? You
mike_ehrmantraut  You won, Walter.
mike_ehrmantraut  You got the job.
mike_ehrmantraut  Do yourself a favor and learn to take yes for an answer.
walter_white  Yeah
walter_white  Yeah, I got the job, but for how long? Get me in a room with
walter_white  Mike, just get me in a room, and I'll do the rest.
mike_ehrmantraut  You done?
mike_ehrmantraut  Thanks for the drink.
biker_#1  Hey, my man, you know how to party, brother. Epic! Epic! Uh, seriously, where
biker_#1  where are
jesse_pinkman  are you
jesse_pinkman  two going?
badger  Jesse, I've been awake for, like, three straight days.
badger  I'm turning into a Sleestak.
jesse_pinkman  So crash here.
jesse_pinkman  It's not like I ain't got the space.
badger  Yeah, that's cool and all, but I think I got, like, this cat.
badger  I think I'm, like, supposed to feed it
jesse_pinkman  Whatever, you little bitch.
jesse_pinkman  What about you?
jesse_pinkman  You sticking, or do I got to flip you over and check you for a slizz?
skinny_pete  Bro, I'm kind of pushing flowers here, yo.
skinny_pete  I ain't proud of it, but it's God's honest truth.
skinny_pete  Hell, brother, you know we got man love for you.
skinny_pete  Now that you're back in the mix, it's like nothing but good days ahead.
skinny_pete  of time to pace it out is all I'm saying.
