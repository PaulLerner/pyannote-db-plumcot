#unknown You can do this.
#unknown You have reached Walter White.
#unknown Please state your name number, and the reason for your call.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Third try.
#unknown Walt, if you're there, please pick up.
#unknown I realty wanted to do this together but I can hear him getting up.
#unknown It's not like I can keep him from seeing the thing.
#unknown So, I'm sorry, but I've waited as long as possible and I  I guess I'm gonna have to go ahead without you.
#unknown So call me.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Happy birthday, sweet 16.
#unknown Thanks, Mom.
#unknown Of course, I thought you might sleep through it.
#unknown So since it's almost, oh, noon I think your first big birthday decision is breakfast or lunch?  Pancakes?  Pancakes it is.
#unknown Oh, could you do me a favour? I forgot to get the paper.
#unknown Can you grab it for me?  Sure.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Surprise.
#unknown It's from me and your dad.
#unknown It's pretty slick, huh? Yeah.
#unknown Thanks, Mom.
#unknown it's  it's great.
#unknown I really did a lot of research and, I don't know, this car just really stood out to me.
#unknown It's got a ton of great features, power everything, solid engine.
#unknown It's really roomy so you can, you know, carpool with all your friends.
#unknown And, of course, it is safe because I'm still your mother.
#unknown And it has a CD player so you can listen to tunes while cruising around.
#unknown So you know what? Breakfast can wait.
#unknown You wanna take it for a spin? Maybe later.
#unknown I'm kind of starving.
#unknown Yeah, okay.
#unknown Well, let's  Let's get those pancakes going.
#unknown Saul, he's here.
#unknown Bad idea.
#unknown This is a bad idea.
#unknown Saul? Send him in.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Beneke.
#unknown Saul Goodman.
#unknown Thank you for coming down.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Yeah, hi.
#unknown Have a seat, please.
#unknown I I don't understand why I'm here.
#unknown Something to do with my creditors?  Creditors? No.
#unknown Your Greataunt Birgit passed away.
#unknown I'm sorry, who? Apparently she passed away in Diekirch, Luxembourg.
#unknown And this was Wow, eight years ago.
#unknown I just assumed you two were close, given that  Well, maybe this is good news.
#unknown Birgit left behind a sizable estate of which you, Mr.
#unknown Beneke, are the primary beneficiary.
#unknown What? She had no immediate relatives so the estate's just been sitting while the folks over in the EU searched for a living heir.
#unknown Well, I don't know of any relatives in Luxembourg.
#unknown Definitely no one who would name me in their will.
#unknown Well  Well, here we go.
#unknown She left no will.
#unknown So that's probably why it took so long.
#unknown They traced the inheritance to your father.
#unknown But having passed" My condolences.
#unknown you are the next in line to the tune of $621,552.
#unknown 33.
#unknown And when does Don Eladio arrive? Let's see how the cook goes first.
#unknown Who's the chemist? Is this a joke? He's asking if you're the chemist.
#unknown I'm one of them.
#unknown Okay, we've all met.
#unknown Let's get to work.
#unknown Where's the phenyl:acetic acid? Please show him the phenyl:acetic acid.
#unknown We synthesize it ourselves.
#unknown All the ingredients are here.
#unknown They synthesize their own.
#unknown What? I don't do that.
#unknown What's the problem? Look, I get my phenylacetic acid from the barrel with the bee on it.
#unknown That's how I know how to do it.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Pinkman was under the impression that the phenylacetic acid would already be synthesized upon his arrival.
#unknown Any sophomore chemistry student can make it.
#unknown What kind of amateur have you brought us?  What's he saying?  We're working it out.
#unknown This is ridiculous.
#unknown I'm not letting some infant who can't even synthesize phenylacetic acid teach me my business.
#unknown Tell this asshole if he wants to learn how to make my product he's gotta do it my way.
#unknown The right way.
#unknown I speak English.
#unknown So you understand what "asshole" means.
#unknown Now, go get me my phenylacetic acid, asshole.
#unknown How long is it gonna take to get him what he needs? I don't know.
#unknown I have no idea.
#unknown Several hours, at least.
#unknown I can wait.
#unknown Gives us time to talk about the state of this lab.
#unknown Don't you have standards? I mean, this place is disgusting.
#unknown All right, we're gonna scour every vat, every tank, every cook surface.
#unknown We clean up every possible source of contamination.
#unknown And then we cook.
#unknown Who do you think you are? I'm the guy your boss brought here to show you how it's done.
#unknown And if this is how you run your lab, no wonder.
#unknown You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
#unknown Now, if you don't want that to happen I suggest you stop whining like a little bitch, and do what I say.
#unknown Clean up! You have reached Walter White.
#unknown Please state your name number, and the reason for your call.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Dad, you there? I'm outside.
#unknown Are you okay? I know you're home, your car is here.
#unknown You missed my party which feels like something's gotta be really wrong.
#unknown I I'm gonna have to call 911.
#unknown I don't know what else to do.
#unknown Dad? Come in, if you're coming in.
#unknown What happened to you? What happened? I got into a fight.
#unknown What do you mean, a fight? Like? What fight? Are you gonna talk to me here? What are you doing?  I'm calling Mom.
#unknown Don't do that.
#unknown Look, I  I appreciate that you're concerned, but I'm fine.
#unknown Just do not call your mother.
#unknown Why not? Because I was gambling.
#unknown If you tell your mother, I just I will never, never hear the end of it.
#unknown So please.
#unknown Can we just keep this between us? Would you do that for me? Just  Just keep it to yourself.
#unknown I don't understand.
#unknown How'd you get into a fight? And with who? I made a mistake.
#unknown It's my own fault.
#unknown I had it coming.
#unknown Dad it's okay.
#unknown It's all my fault.
#unknown I just  I'm sorry.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Dad.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Dad, it's okay.
#unknown No.
#unknown Hey, hey, no.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown Come on, please.
#unknown it's okay.
#unknown No.
#unknown Look at me.
#unknown Look at me.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It is.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown It's it's okay.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown How was your birthday? Good.
#unknown Get some rest.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown The new car did you drive it here? Yeah.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown You like it? Sure.
#unknown I do.
#unknown It drives great.
#unknown That's good, Jesse.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Well done.
#unknown The first of many.
#unknown Yeah? What's that mean? You're staying.
#unknown You belong to the cartel now.
#unknown You can't come to my work like this.
#unknown You're too recognizable.
#unknown Your face is plastered on every bus bench within a fivemile radius.
#unknown Celebrities have to get their cars washed just like everybody else.
#unknown I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important.
#unknown Okay?  What is it? Well, I went ahead and met with your Mr.
#unknown Beneke.
#unknown Right? Which, I will say again, loudly and for the record, bad idea.
#unknown Yes, but it is better than prison, correct? Marginally.
#unknown Which is why I disbursed the funds as you requested.
#unknown All right, good.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I can't believe he actually bought it.
#unknown Greataunt Birgit.
#unknown What? But you called it.
#unknown People see zeros dance before their eyes it's like highway hypnosis.
#unknown So, what's the problem? Let's just say, you and I don't wear the same rosecolored glasses where Johnny Fabulous is concerned.
#unknown So I kept an eye on his bank accounts, and pulled his credit report.
#unknown If you would, note the time on that.
#unknown Three fiftyfour p.
#unknown m.
#unknown yesterday.
#unknown Three hours after leaving my office.
#unknown He bought a Mercedes SL550.
#unknown He's actually leasing it, but he put 4500 down.
#unknown He's gonna pay 1830 a month.
#unknown Fully loaded.
#unknown He even got the heated steering wheel.
#unknown But that's upwards of 6300 that won't be going to the IRS.
#unknown I just thought you might like to know, loath as I am to say, I told you so.
#unknown Where is he now? Hey.
#unknown How you doing? Good.
#unknown How are you? I'm fine, but your mother is going to be worried sick.
#unknown I called her last night.
#unknown On, God.
#unknown I told her I was spending the night at Louis'.
#unknown It's cool.
#unknown So  How are you? I'm fine, son.
#unknown I  I Well, I  I took these painkillers that I had leftover from my surgery and I made the brilliant decision to wash them down with a couple of beers.
#unknown Not my most sterling moment, I admit.
#unknown But I'm fine.
#unknown I wish I could take back last night.
#unknown It was your birthday.
#unknown This shouldn't be on your mind.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown No, it's not okay.
#unknown I'm your father, and I don't want last night to be  I mean, you really can't think of me like Like what? I don't understand.
#unknown My father died when I was 6.
#unknown You knew that, right?  Yeah.
#unknown He had Huntington's disease.
#unknown it's  It destroys portions of the brain affects muscle control leads to dementia, it's just a nasty disease.
#unknown It's genetic.
#unknown Terrified my mother that I might have it so they ran tests on me when I was a kid, but I came up clean.
#unknown My father fell very ill when I was four or 5.
#unknown He spent a lot of time in the hospital.
#unknown My  My mother would tell me so many stories about my father.
#unknown She would talk about him all the time.
#unknown I knew about his personality how he treated people I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked.
#unknown Medium rare.
#unknown Just like you.
#unknown I knew things about my father.
#unknown I had a lot of information.
#unknown It's because people would tell me these things.
#unknown They would paint this picture of my father for me.
#unknown And I always pretended that was who I saw too.
#unknown Who I remembered.
#unknown But it was a lie.
#unknown In truth, I only have one real actual memory of my father.
#unknown It must have been right before he died.
#unknown My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him.
#unknown And I remember the smell in there, the chemicals.
#unknown It was as if they used up every single cleaning product they could find in a 50mile radius.
#unknown Like they didn't want you smelling the sick people.
#unknown There was this stench of Lysol and bleach.
#unknown I mean, you could just feel it coating your lungs.
#unknown Anyway, there lying on the bed is my father.
#unknown He's all  He's all twisted up.
#unknown And my mom she puts me on her lap.
#unknown She's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at him.
#unknown But really, he just scares me.
#unknown And he's looking right at me but I can't even be sure that he knows who I am.
#unknown And your grandmother is talking trying to be cheerful, you know, as she does but the only thing I could remember is him breathing.
#unknown This  This rattling sound.
#unknown Like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can.
#unknown Like there was nothing in him.
#unknown Anyway that is the only real memory that I have of my father.
#unknown I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night.
#unknown I don't want that to be the memory you have of me when I'm gone.
#unknown Remembering you that way wouldn't be so bad.
#unknown The bad way to remember you would be the way  The way you've been this whole last year.
#unknown At least last night you were  You were real, you know?  Bye.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Somewhere you should be? Well, basically it was a temporary hiatus.
#unknown But you give us two weeks, we will be up and running 100 percent.
#unknown All right, you talk to your people and get back to me, okay?  Hi.
#unknown Yeah, thanks, Tanya.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown You bet.
#unknown Say hi to the kids for me.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Nice surprise.
#unknown What's up? Just thought I'd swing by, see how things are going.
#unknown Well, things are  Things took a turn.
#unknown it's kind of crazy.
#unknown Oh, yeah? The universe is telling me something.
#unknown I got some good news.
#unknown Some very good news and I'm getting the business going again.
#unknown I figure we haven't been down long so we should be able to get most of our old contracts back.
#unknown Sit.
#unknown Oh, thank you.
#unknown That's Gosh, that's  That's wow.
#unknown How is that even possible? Well, I got a very unexpected cash infusion.
#unknown I guess someone's looking out for me.
#unknown I guess so.
#unknown Is that yours, outside? Yeah, well, you know I can't be driving a piece of crap.
#unknown You got to present that successful image.
#unknown Right.
#unknown So the IRS stuff.
#unknown That's resolved? Yeah, it's in progress.
#unknown So you paid them? Well, not yet.
#unknown But I will.
#unknown When? Well, it's not that simple.
#unknown Here's the thing: I never had proper legal counsel.
#unknown So I was thinking I should hire someone good who can maybe hammer out a better deal.
#unknown There will never be a better deal, Ted.
#unknown The deal is you pay your back taxes you pay your penalty and you don't go to prison.
#unknown That's a good deal.
#unknown So  Let's keep our priorities straight.
#unknown Well, my priority is getting my business back.
#unknown And putting my employees back on the payroll so they can pay the mortgages.
#unknown Right.
#unknown But I think your employees would agree that you need to get your financial situation in control before you can help them.
#unknown Boy, the IRS got you on commission? I'm just saying that, though I really understand the temptation to restart the business maybe the universe is telling you that you need to pay what you owe.
#unknown Skyler this is my money.
#unknown Why are we having this conversation? You're no longer a part of my life.
#unknown A decision you made, by the way.
#unknown So I don't understand why you're hectoring me about this.
#unknown Ted, this affects both of us.
#unknown No it doesn't.
#unknown I'm telling you to drop this.
#unknown You need to use that money to pay your bill.
#unknown By the end of this month.
#unknown Which you promised the IRS in writing that you would do.
#unknown It is that simple.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay, duly noted.
#unknown What does that mean? Does that mean yes? Because I really need a yes here, Ted.
#unknown All right, Skyler, I'll tell you what it means.
#unknown It means in the most respectful way possible, there's the door.
#unknown And I'm inviting you to, you know  And thank you for your concern, but I'm done talking about this.
#unknown From whom exactly do you think you got that 600,000, Ted? Greataunt Birgit? That was you? Yeah.
#unknown What is this shit? I don't get a vote? I'm supposed to just stay down here forever? I promise you this: Either we're all going home or none of us are.
#unknown Now settle down.
#unknown On your feet.
#unknown Gustavo.
#unknown I'm so happy you finally came to your senses.
#unknown May I present the cook.
#unknown This is your new employer.
#unknown You address him as Don Eladio.
#unknown It's a term of respect.
#unknown Hello, young man.
#unknown He doesn't speak a word of Spanish, does he? And he's no chemist I'll tell you that.
#unknown I don't care if he's a pig farmer.
#unknown He cooks better meth than you do with all your fancy college degrees.
#unknown And this one will have plenty of time to learn Spanish.
#unknown What's in there? A gift? Gustavo, you're so generous.
#unknown It's a token of respect.
#unknown In honor of our renewed friendship.
#unknown Let's see what's in here.
#unknown No, impossible! Zafiro Añejo! Look at this.
#unknown Even the bottle is a work of art.
#unknown It's perfection! Perhaps it's too good to share.
#unknown What do you think, Gustavo? It's yours to do with as you choose.
#unknown I choose to drink it! Careful.
#unknown That's beautiful stuff.
#unknown If you spill a drop I'll cut off your hand.
#unknown Come on, hurry up.
#unknown Gustavo.
#unknown Welcome to Mexico.
#unknown Now you say: This one's an addict.
#unknown To work, he must be sober.
#unknown None for you! Enough business! Bring the girls! No.
#unknown No, no, I don't  Gustavo.
#unknown Cheer up, man.
#unknown Gustavo I'm not angry.
#unknown I had to spank you.
#unknown But what choice did I have? Look, once every 20 years you forget your place.
#unknown There's no place for emotion in this.
#unknown You of all people should understand.
#unknown Business is business.
#unknown If you'll excuse me.
#unknown Where are you going?  To use your bathroom.
#unknown If I may.
#unknown Miguel! Show Gustavo the pisser.
#unknown And make sure he doesn't get lost.
#unknown Hurry up.
#unknown Make yourself useful.
#unknown Find a gun.
#unknown Don Eladio is dead! His capos are dead! You have no one left to fight for! Fill your pockets and leave in peace! Or fight me and die! I hope to hell that works.
#unknown Take him.
#unknown Keys.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey, you still with us? Go.
#unknown Kid, get us out of here, kid.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown
