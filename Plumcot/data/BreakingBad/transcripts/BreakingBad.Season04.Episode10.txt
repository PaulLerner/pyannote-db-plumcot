francesca_liddy  Bad
saul_goodman  This
saul_goodman  is a
francesca_liddy  idea.
saul_goodman  Send him in.
saul_goodman  Mr. Beneke.
saul_goodman  Saul Goodman.
saul_goodman  Thank you for coming down.
ted_beneke  hi.
saul_goodman  Have a seat, please.
ted_beneke  I I don't understand why I'm here.
ted_beneke  Something to do with my creditors?
saul_goodman  Creditors?
saul_goodman  No.
saul_goodman  Your
saul_goodman  Your Greataunt Birgit passed away.
ted_beneke  I'm sorry, who?
saul_goodman  Apparently she passed away in Diekirch, Luxembourg.
saul_goodman  And this was Wow, eight years ago.
saul_goodman  I just assumed you two were close, given that
saul_goodman  maybe this is good news.
saul_goodman  Birgit left behind a sizable estate of which you, Mr. Beneke, are the primary beneficiary.
ted_beneke  What?
saul_goodman  She had no immediate relatives so the estate's just been sitting while the folks over in the EU searched for a living heir.
ted_beneke  I don't know of any relatives in Luxembourg.
ted_beneke  Definitely no one who would name me in their will.
saul_goodman  Well, here we go.
saul_goodman  She left no will.
saul_goodman  So that's probably why it took so long.
saul_goodman  They traced the inheritance to your father.
saul_goodman  But having passed" My condolences.
saul_goodman  you are the next in line to the tune of $621,552. 33. And when
gaff  does Don Eladio arrive? Let's see how the cook goes first. Who's the chemist? Is this a joke? He's asking if you're the chemist
jesse_pinkman  I'm one of them.
gaff  Let's get to work. Where's the phenyl:acetic acid? Please show him the phenyl:acetic acid. We synthesize
gaff  it ourselves. All the ingredients are here. They synthesize their own. What?
jesse_pinkman  I don't do that. What's the problem? Look, I get my phenylacetic acid
gustavo_fring  acid from
jesse_pinkman  from the barrel with the bee on it.
jesse_pinkman  That's how I know how to do it. Mr. Pinkman was under the impression that the phenylacetic acid would already be synthesized upon his arrival. Any sophomore chemistry student can make it.
gustavo_fring  What
jesse_pinkman  What kind of amateur have you brought us? What's he saying?
gustavo_fring  We're working it
benicio_fuentes  This
benicio_fuentes  I'm not letting some infant who can't even synthesize phenylacetic acid teach me my business
jesse_pinkman  Tell this asshole if he wants to learn how to make my product he's gotta do it my way.
jesse_pinkman  The right way.
jesse_pinkman  So you understand what" asshole" means.
jesse_pinkman  Now
gaff  go get me my phenylacetic acid, asshole. How long is it gonna take to get him what he needs?
benicio_fuentes  I don't know.
benicio_fuentes  I have no idea. Several
benicio_fuentes  Several hours, at least.
jesse_pinkman  I can wait.
jesse_pinkman  Gives us time to talk about the state of this lab.
jesse_pinkman  Don't you have standards?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, this place is disgusting.
jesse_pinkman  right, we're gonna scour every vat, every tank, every cook surface.
jesse_pinkman  We clean up every possible source of contamination.
jesse_pinkman  And then we cook.
benicio_fuentes  Who do you think you are?
jesse_pinkman  I'm the guy your boss brought here to show you how it's done.
jesse_pinkman  And if this is how you run your lab, no wonder.
jesse_pinkman  You're lucky he hasn't fired your ass.
jesse_pinkman  Now, if you don't want that to happen I suggest you stop whining like a little bitch, and do what I say.
walter_white  You have reached Walter White.
walter_white  reason for your call. Thank you. Dad, you there? I'm outside. Are you okay? I know you're home, your car is here.
walter_white_jr.  You missed my
walter_white_jr.  party which feels like something's gotta be really wrong.
walter_white_jr.  I
walter_white  I don't know what else to do. Dad? Come in, if you're
walter_white_jr.  in. What happened to you
walter_white  What happened? I got into a fight.
walter_white_jr.  do you mean, a fight?
walter_white_jr.  Like?
walter_white_jr.  What fight?
walter_white_jr.  Are you gonna talk to me here?
walter_white  I'm
walter_white_jr.  calling Mom.
walter_white  Don't do that.
walter_white  Look, I I appreciate that you're concerned, but I'm fine.
walter_white  Just do not call your mother.
walter_white_jr.  Why not?
walter_white  Because I was gambling.
walter_white  If you tell your mother, I just
walter_white  will never, never hear the end of it.
walter_white  So please.
walter_white  Can we just keep this between us?
walter_white  Would you do that for me?
walter_white  Just Just keep it to yourself.
walter_white_jr.  I don't understand.
walter_white_jr.  How'd you get into a fight?
walter_white_jr.  And with who?
walter_white  I made a mistake.
walter_white  I had it coming. Dad it's okay. It's all my fault.
walter_white  Come on.
walter_white_jr.  Dad, it's okay.
walter_white  Hey, hey, no.
walter_white  It's okay. Come on, please.
walter_white_jr.  okay.
walter_white_jr.  No
walter_white_jr.  No. Look at me
walter_white_jr.  me. Look
walter_white_jr.  at me.
walter_white_jr.  It's okay. It
walter_white_jr.  Come on. Come on
walter_white_jr.  It's it's okay.
walter_white  How was your
walter_white_jr.  Good.
walter_white_jr.  Get some rest.
walter_white  Okay
walter_white  The new car did you drive it here? Yeah
walter_white_jr.  Yeah.
walter_white  You like
walter_white_jr.  Sure.
walter_white_jr.  I do.
walter_white_jr.  It drives great.
walter_white  That's good, Jesse.
gaff  The first of many.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah? What's that mean?
gaff  You're staying.
gaff  You belong to the cartel now.
skyler_white  You can't come to my work like this.
skyler_white  You're too recognizable.
skyler_white  Your face is plastered on every bus bench within a fivemile radius.
saul_goodman  Celebrities have to get their cars washed just like everybody else.
saul_goodman  I wouldn't have come if it wasn't important.
saul_goodman  Okay?
skyler_white  What is it?
saul_goodman  Well, I went ahead and met with your Mr. Beneke.
saul_goodman  Right?
saul_goodman  Which, I will say again, loudly and for the record, bad idea. Yes
skyler_white  Yes, but it is better than prison, correct?
saul_goodman  Marginally.
saul_goodman  Which is why I disbursed the funds as you requested.
skyler_white  All right, good. Yeah.
saul_goodman  I can't
saul_goodman  can't believe he actually bought it.
saul_goodman  Greataunt Birgit.
saul_goodman  What?
saul_goodman  But you called it.
saul_goodman  People see zeros dance before their eyes it's like highway hypnosis.
skyler_white  So, what's the problem?
saul_goodman  Let's just say, you and I don't wear the same rosecolored glasses where Johnny Fabulous is concerned.
saul_goodman  So I kept an eye on his bank accounts, and pulled his credit report.
saul_goodman  If you would, note the time on that
skyler_white  Three fiftyfour p. m. yesterday.
saul_goodman  Three hours after leaving my office.
skyler_white  He bought a Mercedes SL550. He's
saul_goodman  He's actually leasing it, but he put 4500 down.
saul_goodman  He's gonna pay 1830 a month.
saul_goodman  Fully loaded.
saul_goodman  He even got the heated steering wheel.
saul_goodman  But that's upwards of 6300 that won't be going to the IRS. I
saul_goodman  I just thought you might like to know, loath as I am to say, I told you so.
skyler_white  Where is he now?
walter_white_jr.  How you doing
walter_white_jr.  How are you?
walter_white  I'm fine, but your mother is going to be worried sick.
walter_white_jr.  I called her last night.
walter_white  On, God.
walter_white_jr.  I told her I was spending the night at Louis'.
walter_white_jr.  It's cool.
walter_white_jr.  So How are you?
walter_white  I'm fine, son.
walter_white  Well, I I took these painkillers that I had leftover from my surgery and I made the brilliant decision to wash them down with a couple of beers.
walter_white  my most sterling moment, I admit.
walter_white  But I'm fine
walter_white  I wish I could take back last night.
walter_white  was your birthday.
walter_white  This shouldn't be on your mind.
walter_white_jr.  It's okay. No
walter_white  No, it's not okay.
walter_white  I'm your father, and I don't want last night to be I mean, you really can't think of me like
walter_white_jr.  Like what?
walter_white_jr.  I don't understand.
walter_white  My father died when I was 6.
walter_white  You knew that,
walter_white  He had Huntington's disease. it's
walter_white  destroys portions of the brain affects muscle control leads to dementia, it's just a nasty disease.
walter_white  It's genetic.
walter_white  Terrified my mother that I might have it so they ran tests on me when I was a kid, but I came up clean
walter_white  My father fell very ill when I was four or 5.
walter_white  He spent a lot of time in the hospital.
walter_white  My My mother would tell me so many stories about my father.
walter_white  She would talk about him all the time
walter_white  I knew about his personality how he treated people I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked.
walter_white  Medium rare.
walter_white  Just like you.
walter_white  I knew things about my father.
walter_white  I had a lot of information.
walter_white  It's because people would tell me these things.
walter_white  They would paint this picture of my father for me.
walter_white  And I always pretended that was who I saw too.
walter_white  Who I remembered.
walter_white  But it was a lie.
walter_white  In truth, I only have one real actual memory of my father.
walter_white  It must have been right before he died.
walter_white  My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him.
walter_white  And I remember the smell in there, the chemicals.
walter_white  It was as if they used up every single cleaning product they could find in a 50mile radius.
walter_white  Like they didn't want you smelling the sick people
walter_white  this stench of Lysol and bleach.
walter_white  I mean, you could just feel it coating your lungs.
walter_white  Anyway, there lying on the bed is my
walter_white  father. He's all He's all twisted up
walter_white  my mom she puts me on her lap. She's
walter_white  She's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at
walter_white  But really, he just scares me.
walter_white  And he's looking right at me but I can't even be sure that he knows who I am.
walter_white  And your grandmother is talking trying to be cheerful, you know, as she does but the only thing I could remember is him breathing.
walter_white  This rattling sound.
walter_white  Like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can.
walter_white  Like there was nothing in him.
walter_white  Anyway that is the only real memory that I have of my father.
walter_white  I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night.
walter_white  I don't want that to be the memory you have of me when I'm gone.
walter_white_jr.  Remembering you that way wouldn't be so bad.
walter_white_jr.  The bad way to remember you would be the way
walter_white_jr.  The way you've been this whole last year.
walter_white_jr.  least last night you were
walter_white_jr.  You were real, you know?
tyrus_kitt  Somewhere you should be?
ted_beneke  Well, basically it was a temporary hiatus.
ted_beneke  But you give us two weeks, we will be up and running 100 percent
ted_beneke  All right, you talk to your people and get back to me, okay?
ted_beneke  Yeah, thanks, Tanya.
ted_beneke  Okay.
ted_beneke  You bet.
ted_beneke  Say hi to the kids for me.
ted_beneke  Nice surprise.
skyler_white  up? Just thought I'd swing by, see how things are going.
ted_beneke  Well, things are
ted_beneke  Things took a turn.
ted_beneke  it's kind of crazy.
skyler_white  Oh, yeah?
ted_beneke  The universe is telling me something.
ted_beneke  I got some good news.
ted_beneke  Some very good news and I'm getting the business going again.
ted_beneke  I figure we haven't been down long so we should be able to get most of our old contracts back.
ted_beneke  Sit
skyler_white  Sit.
skyler_white  Oh,
skyler_white  Gosh,
skyler_white  that's That's wow. How is that even possible?
ted_beneke  Well, I got a very unexpected cash infusion.
ted_beneke  guess someone's looking out for me.
skyler_white  I guess so.
skyler_white  Is that yours, outside?
ted_beneke  Yeah, well, you know I can't be driving a piece of crap.
ted_beneke  You got to present that successful image.
skyler_white  Right.
skyler_white  So the IRS stuff.
skyler_white  That's resolved?
ted_beneke  Yeah, it's in progress.
skyler_white  So you paid them
ted_beneke  Well, not yet.
ted_beneke  But I will.
ted_beneke  it's not that simple.
ted_beneke  thing : I never had proper legal counsel.
ted_beneke  So I was thinking I should hire someone good who can maybe hammer out a better deal.
skyler_white  There will never be a better deal, Ted.
skyler_white  The deal is you pay your back taxes you pay your penalty and you don't go to prison.
skyler_white  a good deal.
skyler_white  So
skyler_white  Let's keep our priorities straight.
ted_beneke  Well, my priority is getting my business back.
ted_beneke  And putting my employees back on the payroll so they can pay the mortgages.
skyler_white  Right.
skyler_white  But I think your employees would agree that you need to get your financial situation in control before you can help them.
ted_beneke  the IRS got you on commission?
skyler_white  I'm just saying that, though I really understand the temptation to restart the business maybe the universe is telling you that you need to pay what you owe.
ted_beneke  Skyler this is my money.
ted_beneke  are we having this conversation?
ted_beneke  You're no longer a part of my life.
ted_beneke  A decision you made, by the way.
ted_beneke  So I don't understand why you're hectoring me about this.
skyler_white  Ted, this affects both of us.
ted_beneke  No it doesn't.
ted_beneke  I'm telling you to drop this
skyler_white  this. You need to use that money to pay your bill.
skyler_white  By the end of this month.
skyler_white  Which you promised the IRS in writing that you would do.
skyler_white  It is that simple.
ted_beneke  Okay, duly noted.
skyler_white  What does that mean?
skyler_white  Does that mean yes?
skyler_white  Because I really need a yes here, Ted.
ted_beneke  All right, Skyler, I'll tell you what it means.
ted_beneke  It means in the most respectful way possible, there's the door.
ted_beneke  And I'm inviting you to, you know
ted_beneke  And thank you for your concern, but I'm done talking about this.
skyler_white  From whom exactly do you think you got that 600,000, Ted?
ted_beneke  Greataunt Birgit?
ted_beneke  That was you?
jesse_pinkman  this shit?
jesse_pinkman  I don't get a vote? I'm supposed to just stay down here
mike_ehrmantraut  I promise you this :
mike_ehrmantraut  Either we're all going home or none of us are.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now settle down.
mike_ehrmantraut  On your feet.
