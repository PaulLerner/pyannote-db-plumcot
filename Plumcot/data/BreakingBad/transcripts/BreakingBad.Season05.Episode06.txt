#unknown You guys didn't tell me this stuff smells like cat piss.
#unknown Man, shit happens, huh? I mean, I'm sorry, but I had to do it.
#unknown Obviously, I guess you see it different.
#unknown Some of you.
#unknown But I didn't see any other choice.
#unknown I've been thinking about this all day, going over it in my head and it was the only way.
#unknown Well, it's not like I wanted to.
#unknown The kid was on a dirt bike.
#unknown He could've just He could've gunned it and been gone before we even had a chance to blink.
#unknown We never would've caught him.
#unknown I thought on my feet.
#unknown I saw a threat  and I took care of it.
#unknown A threat? The kid was waving at us.
#unknown He wasn't going anywhere.
#unknown He was saying hi.
#unknown Yeah, but you don't know that.
#unknown Yeah, I do.
#unknown He didn't know what he'd seen.
#unknown I didn't want to take that chance.
#unknown The whole point of this was no one was supposed to know we were there.
#unknown People weren't supposed to know anything got robbed.
#unknown How could we let the kid go? He made us.
#unknown If I hadn't done what I did, the mission would've failed.
#unknown I'm real sorry.
#unknown I really am, but I But did I make a mistake, Mr.
#unknown White? Because to me, you know, respectfully I was looking out for the team.
#unknown I didn't want to kill him.
#unknown You gotta believe that.
#unknown At the end of the day, it was him or us, and I chose us.
#unknown And I would do it again.
#unknown Okay, look.
#unknown Todd, why don't you step outside for a few minutes so we can talk this through? Of course.
#unknown Yeah, you guys talk.
#unknown But I just want to make sure that you know that my priority is this business.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown That's fine, Todd.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown I want to be a real part of this.
#unknown All right? If you could just see that.
#unknown I'm motivated and I've got connections.
#unknown My uncle's got his hookups in prison who I think could be a real help to us if Okay.
#unknown That dude? Wack job.
#unknown Let's just stick to the facts here.
#unknown Facts? Oh, okay.
#unknown How about the fact that he shot a kid? A kid that he didn't need to shoot.
#unknown Well, the boy had seen us.
#unknown And, no, it didn't look like he knew what he was seeing.
#unknown But what if he told somebody? What if he just mentioned it in passing? We can't know what someone Exactly.
#unknown We can't know, because Ricky Hitler there shot him.
#unknown We, us three, should've had a discussion about it.
#unknown We would've figured it out.
#unknown But that dickhead just went ahead and made the choice for us.
#unknown Is that how we do business now?  I understand you're upset.
#unknown And what was that crap about his uncle with the prison connections? It's just some bullshit intimidation move.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown It's true, though.
#unknown He does have some connections.
#unknown Is this a problem?  No.
#unknown It's nothing to be concerned about.
#unknown It came up in the background I did on him.
#unknown Didn't worry me then.
#unknown He's just flexing.
#unknown All right.
#unknown It seems to me that we have three options here and none of which are ideal.
#unknown One, we fire Todd.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm not a fan of this option seeing that he knows way too much about this business at this point.
#unknown And we'd most likely have to pay him to keep quiet.
#unknown And God only knows we've got enough of that going on.
#unknown Two: We dispose of him.
#unknown Which leaves us option three.
#unknown We keep him on payroll.
#unknown Put him back on tenting houses, setting up the lab and so forth.
#unknown We keep him close.
#unknown Under our control.
#unknown Now, option three would be my choice.
#unknown Shall we vote? I vote three, kid.
#unknown You're still in.
#unknown Right on.
#unknown Thank you so much.
#unknown You guys totally made the right The next time you bring a gun to a job without telling me I will stick it up your ass sideways.
#unknown You understand?  Yes, sir.
#unknown Hey, boss.
#unknown What's up? I was just in the neighbourhood.
#unknown Anything going on? No.
#unknown He's just hanging out with his granddaughter.
#unknown Well, isn't that sweet? Here, let me see.
#unknown It's a dead drop.
#unknown What?  A dead drop.
#unknown He just stashed something underneath that trash can.
#unknown Write the time down.
#unknown Roll on it.
#unknown Looks like he's leaving.
#unknown Anybody coming for it?  Nope, not that I can see.
#unknown Nobody in sight.
#unknown Could be hours.
#unknown Could be.
#unknown What do you want to do? It's not my fault that Murtha's got his panties in a twist.
#unknown It's an HR issue, Janice.
#unknown I read the report.
#unknown I'm calling again because that's the wrong case file number.
#unknown All right? I don't know what kind of shoddy stan First off, Miracle Whip is not mayonnaise, okay? "Looks like it" doesn't equal "tastes like it.
#unknown " Secondly, every time it's like they gotta slather an entire jar bastard's screwing with us now.
#unknown How'd he make you? What'd you do? We honked our horns and yelled "yoohoo.
#unknown " What do you mean, what did we do? This guy is slippery as hell.
#unknown He's been throwing every tail we put on him.
#unknown The guy's a pro.
#unknown Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.
#unknown One of these days, our pal Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.
#unknown Just gotta be there when he does.
#unknown Teenagers.
#unknown Sometimes you just want to strangle them.
#unknown How's it going? Oh, you know.
#unknown Well, this little munchkin, I could just keep her forever.
#unknown She is just the sweetest little baby ever born.
#unknown Yes, she is.
#unknown I don't see much of Flynn.
#unknown That car of his keeps him pretty busy.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown More importantly, how are you doing? I'm okay.
#unknown How's the therapy? I know Dave helped me so much when I was going through my little How's your guy'?  Peter.
#unknown Peter.
#unknown He's Yeah, he's good.
#unknown I feel like I'm making progress.
#unknown That's great.
#unknown You know, you just keep working through it.
#unknown Honey.
#unknown Babe, what is it? It's okay.
#unknown It's all right.
#unknown Why don't you let me take Holly, and then we'll talk about this?  No.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right, that's fine.
#unknown Then how about you just talk to me? Just tell me what's going on.
#unknown I just I need to make the right decision.
#unknown I need them to be safe.
#unknown The kids? They're safe.
#unknown Of course they are.
#unknown I just miss them so much.
#unknown I just want to be with them.
#unknown Hey, you know we can bring them back home anytime you want.
#unknown No.
#unknown They need to stay.
#unknown But I just I don't know what to do here.
#unknown I Like, whatever I choose is wrong.
#unknown Skyler, you gotta tell me what's going on.
#unknown I know sometimes you I know you think I have a big mouth sometimes.
#unknown I But if you felt like you couldn't talk to me, I don't know what I'd do.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So, what's this about the kids not being safe? Safe from what? From us.
#unknown From Walt and me.
#unknown Like what? Like you're bad parents? Because you're not.
#unknown Not even close.
#unknown Marie there are things you just don't know that if you knew you'd never speak to me again.
#unknown Try me.
#unknown Okay, if you're not gonna say it, I will.
#unknown Skyler, you have to forgive yourself for Ted.
#unknown What?  You can't keep beating yourself up over some stupid little affair.
#unknown Walt told you.
#unknown Please don't blame him.
#unknown I practically forced him to, and I wasn't gonna say anything.
#unknown But I cannot stand to watch you torture yourself like this.
#unknown You have to forgive yourself, Skyler.
#unknown You were having all these problems with Walt.
#unknown And Ted is a really goodlooking man.
#unknown You're only human.
#unknown Hell, I've even thought of, you know I mean, not seriously, but I totally get your temptation.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Doesn't it feel good to get it off your chest? Oh, yeah.
#unknown I feel better.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown For those who love the taste but not the price there's simulated caviar made of kelp, a type of seaweed.
#unknown A fraction of the cost, it looks, smells and tastes similar to the real thing.
#unknown Ready to get back at it? Unlike fish caviar We have breaking news into our newsroom.
#unknown We've just learned that police are now expanding their search for a missing McKinley County boy after four days with no leads.
#unknown Fourteenyearold Drew Sharp was last seen by his parents Thursday morning.
#unknown Authorities are extending their search today east from Crownpoint to Hospah and Whitehorse.
#unknown Sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike into the desert behind his house.
#unknown Investigators are asking any Jesse, nothing can change this.
#unknown Yeah, it's just that kid's parents  I know.
#unknown Believe me.
#unknown I haven't been able to sleep the past few nights just thinking about it.
#unknown But, Jesse, now, finally, we're selfsufficient.
#unknown Finally we have everything that we need and no one to answer to except ourselves.
#unknown And in a year, year and a half once we've cooked through this methylamine and made our money there will be plenty of time for soulsearching.
#unknown Until then we keep going.
#unknown And we run our business our way and make sure that this never happens again.
#unknown Okay? Look.
#unknown Listen, I'll finish this up.
#unknown Why don't you go on home?  You sure?  Absolutely.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'll take care of this.
#unknown You go on.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Yeah, I was just leaving.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Hello? Walter? What are you doing here? I'm delivering the batch.
#unknown What are you doing here? Might as well get this over with.
#unknown Come in.
#unknown Join us.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Where's your cars? We parked around the block.
#unknown You might consider doing that as well.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So, what's going on? Just since this morning, I threw three separate tails.
#unknown All DEA.
#unknown What?  The feds have been all over me.
#unknown This has been going on for a while now.
#unknown Did they follow you here? No.
#unknown I said I threw them.
#unknown I would never come to the headquarters of our illegal meth operation dragging a bunch of cops, Walter.
#unknown It would be unwise.
#unknown How can you be so sure? Well, I've been doing this a long time.
#unknown It's pretty basic stuff.
#unknown How long has this been going on? Since about the time we started this little venture.
#unknown The DEA, in particular your peach of a brotherinlaw has taken a keen interest in my activities.
#unknown And you're just telling me this now? What, you didn't think this information would be of interest?  Wouldn't be germane?  I've been handling it, Walter.
#unknown We're sitting on a thousand gallons of stolen methylamine.
#unknown Jesus! How can you be so irresponsible? Calm down, would you, please? I can't believe that you kept this from me.
#unknown From us.
#unknown Did you know about this?  Mike just told me.
#unknown And I said calm down.
#unknown I've got it under control.
#unknown Oh, well, forgive me for not having complete confidence.
#unknown You know this can't go on, right?  Yeah, I know.
#unknown And I've already decided.
#unknown I'm out.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well Sorry to see you go, Mike.
#unknown But I really don't see any other way.
#unknown Neither do I.
#unknown Obviously, Jesse you'll have to take over the distribution end of things.
#unknown Mike, I trust that you'll bring Jesse up to speed on your side of the business? Yeah, about that Actually, Mr.
#unknown White I'm out too.
#unknown You're what? I don't think I can do this anymore.
#unknown So I'm retiring, I guess.
#unknown That methylamine that we stole, that we nearly killed ourselves trying to steal? That methylamine, when cooked, is worth nearly $300 million.
#unknown And you're telling me that you're willing to walk away from that? We're walking away from the meth.
#unknown Not the methylamine.
#unknown Jesse and I will be taking our twothirds and selling it.
#unknown I've got a connection, a guy I knew from my time with Fring.
#unknown This guy has the capital, and he's motivated.
#unknown Highly.
#unknown Mike's thinking we'll clear like 5 million.
#unknown Each.
#unknown I'll pay off my guys in lockup out of my share.
#unknown And those legacy costs you're so fond of you won't have to worry about anymore.
#unknown And then I will be going on my way.
#unknown Jesse too.
#unknown It's a solid plan.
#unknown You can come in on this with us.
#unknown That'd be cool.
#unknown Course, you know, you are free to hold onto your third and keep cooking.
#unknown You'll be selling to my competitors.
#unknown This guy and his crew are way out in Phoenix.
#unknown It's a big country, Walter.
#unknown Whole lot of methheads.
#unknown Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.
#unknown And that's what you're gonna sell out for? Pennies? Why? Five million isn't pennies.
#unknown It's more money than I've ever seen.
#unknown And when it comes down to it are we in the meth business? Or the money business? Relax, kid.
#unknown There's no one there.
#unknown You sure? I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
#unknown Glad to see you could make it out.
#unknown I was surprised to get your call.
#unknown Good surprise, I hope.
#unknown There's one gallon, as discussed.
#unknown You take that back home to your people, test it.
#unknown If you're satisfied, I can get the other 665.
#unknown All right.
#unknown That's fair enough.
#unknown Shall we talk money? That one's free.
#unknown The price for the rest is 15,000 per.
#unknown Six hundred and sixtyfive gallons, that's 9,975,000.
#unknown Although I would prefer you round it up to 10.
#unknown Makes it easier for my partner and I to split.
#unknown Steep.
#unknown We good? I'll talk to my guys, but I should be able to put together that cash, yeah.
#unknown Good.
#unknown I gotta tell you, this is worth it just to get that blue stuff of yours off the market.
#unknown The blue stuff will be off the market, right? Now, this whole time, I was thinking 666 that seems like an odd number.
#unknown Twothirds of an even thousand, though.
#unknown When I look at it that way, it starts to make sense to me.
#unknown That's not all the methylamine, is it? You two have a partner you haven't mentioned? This other party wouldn't be a problem for you.
#unknown His territory won't impact yours.
#unknown You see, that doesn't work for me.
#unknown I'm not just buying this for the supply.
#unknown I'm buying this for the demand.
#unknown I'm looking to increase my market share.
#unknown Well, I don't know what to tell you.
#unknown I want you to tell me that Fring's blue will be off the streets.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Here's a new deal for you then.
#unknown I'll pay you 15K a gallon for the full thousand gallons.
#unknown Not a drop less.
#unknown It's not mine to sell, Declan.
#unknown Well, then, no deal, Mike.
#unknown Yes? Yes.
#unknown I guess.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Why don't you come over here? To my house.
#unknown Yes, seriously.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Yo, you sure this is okay? She's not here.
#unknown Nobody's here.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So Something's come up.
#unknown Mike wanted to come here to give you the hard sell but I figured it'd be better coming from me.
#unknown Mike's connection won't buy mine and Mike's shares of the methylamine unless he gets your share too.
#unknown He wants the entire thousand gallons.
#unknown Absolutely not.
#unknown Yeah, I figured you'd say that.
#unknown But I've been thinking about it and it really makes sense.
#unknown Kind of.
#unknown It does, does it? Look, when you started this thing did you ever dream of having $5 million? I know for a fact that you didn't.
#unknown I know for a fact all you needed was 737,000 because you worked it all out, like, mathematically.
#unknown Look, if selling the methylamine now means that no one else ever gets killed then I vote for that, man.
#unknown Hands down.
#unknown And we could have it tomorrow.
#unknown We would be out.
#unknown Spend time with your family.
#unknown No more worrying about them getting hurt or finding out about everything.
#unknown Isn't this what you've been working for? I have not been working this hard just to sell out.
#unknown It's not selling out.
#unknown Yes, it is, Jesse.
#unknown I have We have suffered and bled, literally, for this business.
#unknown And I will not throw it away for nothing.
#unknown I don't know how else to say it, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Five million dollars isn't nothing.
#unknown Jesse, have you heard of a company called Gray Matter?  No.
#unknown Well, I cofounded it in grad school with a couple of friends of mine.
#unknown Actually, I was the one who named it.
#unknown And back then, it was just Oh, it was just smalltime.
#unknown We had a couple patents pending.
#unknown But nothing earthshattering.
#unknown Course, we all knew the potential.
#unknown Yeah, we were gonna take the world by storm.
#unknown And then this Well, something happened between the three of us.
#unknown And I'm not gonna go into detail.
#unknown But for personal reasons I decided to leave the company.
#unknown And I sold my share to my two partners.
#unknown I took a buyout for $5000.
#unknown Now, at the time, that was a lot of money for me.
#unknown Care to guess what that company is worth now? Millions? Billions, with a "B.
#unknown " Twopointonesix billion as of last Friday.
#unknown I look it up every week.
#unknown And I sold my share my potential, for $5000.
#unknown I sold my kids' birthright for a few months' rent.
#unknown This isn't the same thing.
#unknown Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business.
#unknown Neither.
#unknown I'm in the empire business.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, is a meth empire really something to be that proud of? Skyler, you remember Jesse.
#unknown Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.
#unknown Hey, Mrs.
#unknown White.
#unknown Good to see you.
#unknown You have a lovely home.
#unknown I was just heading out.
#unknown Why don't you stay for dinner?  No, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown I'm gonna go.
#unknown Stay.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown It'll be fun.
#unknown It's okay with us, isn't it, Skyler? We don't have anything special planned tonight.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Why not? See? These are great green beans, Mrs.
#unknown White.
#unknown I like that you got the slivered almonds going.
#unknown My mom always made them like that.
#unknown You put lemon in there too? They are from the deli at Albertsons.
#unknown Well you know, good work on your shopping then.
#unknown Because these are choice.
#unknown I eat a lot of frozen stuff.
#unknown It's usually pretty bad.
#unknown I mean, the pictures are always so awesome, you know? It's like, "Hell, yeah, I'm stoked for this lasagna.
#unknown " And then you nuke it, and the cheese gets all scabby on top and it's like you're eating a scab.
#unknown I mean, seriously, what's that about? It's like, yo, whatever happened to truth in advertising? You know? Yeah, it's bad.
#unknown So, hey, how's business? The car wash.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White said it's going really well.
#unknown Says, like, you're a great manager.
#unknown He did, huh? Yeah, he says you've got it running like a Like a machine.
#unknown Like, welloiled.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown What else did he tell you about me? Oh, you know, just good stuff.
#unknown Just really, you know, really good, good stuff.
#unknown We don't really talk that much about you know, personal things.
#unknown Did you also tell him about my affair? May I please be excused? You know my kids are gone? Thank God.
#unknown No.
#unknown I don't mean they're out for the night.
#unknown They're gone.
#unknown They're staying with my inlaws.
#unknown She made me kick my own kids out of the house.
#unknown She told me that she was counting the days until my cancer came back.
#unknown My wife is waiting for me to die.
#unknown This business is all I have left now.
#unknown It's all I have.
#unknown And you want to take it away from me.
#unknown I thought you might try something stupid.
#unknown Look, Mike  Don't bother, Walter.
#unknown Come join me in the office.
#unknown I don't think so.
#unknown That's not a request.
#unknown Might as well get comfortable.
#unknown This deal's going down tomorrow.
#unknown It's happening, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
#unknown Got it?  So it's okay for you to steal my To ensure that, you and I are gonna spend the rest of the night together in this office.
#unknown Like it's my birthday.
#unknown Mike When the deal is done, you'll get your money.
#unknown I guarantee that.
#unknown Let me cook it.
#unknown I'll double your five and you still walk.
#unknown You know, I have never seen anybody work so hard not to get $5 million.
#unknown Mike, you need to listen to me.
#unknown No, Walter.
#unknown The last thing I need to do is listen to you.
#unknown Now, sit down.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Walter, I've got a bit of a quandary here.
#unknown I've got something I need to attend to before this deal happens.
#unknown But for some reason, I don't trust you alone with the methylamine.
#unknown I'm gonna have to restrain you.
#unknown You gotta be kidding.
#unknown Stand up for me, please.
#unknown Stand up.
#unknown Turn around for me.
#unknown Arms out to the side.
#unknown Up.
#unknown Oh, man.
#unknown Sit down.
#unknown Sit down.
#unknown Give me your wrist.
#unknown 30")' Alrighty.
#unknown To what do we owe the pleasure? Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss your illegal harassment of my client.
#unknown This should be good.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Ehrmantraut has become the subject of a vicious, relentless and unwarranted DEA persecution.
#unknown Gomie, does that sound right to you?  I have no idea what he's talking about.
#unknown Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie.
#unknown But we all know you've been following my client day and night.
#unknown The man can't spend a few minutes with his granddaughter without you guys quivering in the bushes and peeping through your binoculars.
#unknown It's Well, it's disturbing.
#unknown And it's taken a toll on his mental and physical wellbeing.
#unknown Your client looks fine to me.
#unknown Well, some hurts only show on the inside.
#unknown Now, you guys don't even have warrants for these tails, do you? Theoretically, these tails you refer to would be within the bounds of the law.
#unknown We don't need a warrant to follow somebody through a public place.
#unknown Theoretically.
#unknown Yeah, that is theoretically correct.
#unknown However, I would counter that an openended, unrestricted surveillance like this amounts to stalking.
#unknown Which is illegal.
#unknown Now, I don't know what it is you find so interesting about my client, and I'm not here to judge.
#unknown Different strokes and all.
#unknown But sadly, he's just not that into you.
#unknown So I have filed for a temporary restraining order against the DEA on behalf of Mr.
#unknown Ehrmantraut.
#unknown Where'd you get your law degree, Goodman? The same clown college you got that suit? You know who likes this suit? Judge Papadoumian.
#unknown She thinks I'm a snappy dresser.
#unknown You know what Judge Papadoumian hates? Police harassment of a senior citizen.
#unknown 30")' Expect a visit from the sheriff, agents.
#unknown You should have your ex parte within the hour.
#unknown Let's go.
#unknown What kind of judge would issue this thing? Papadoumian, man.
#unknown She's like Ho Chi Minh So, what do we do? Well, not a lot of choice, you know? We back off.
#unknown For the moment.
#unknown TRO won't stand up and Goodman knows it.
#unknown I don't see what they're playing at here, but if Ehrmantraut wants a fight  he's gonna get one.
#unknown All right.
#unknown That was a hell of a gamble.
#unknown Worked.
#unknown Yeah, well, not for long.
#unknown And he's right about that TRO.
#unknown It's gonna get tossed tout de suite.
#unknown Meanwhile, Schrader's hardon for you just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.
#unknown So have fun with that.
#unknown How much time I got? Maybe 24 hours.
#unknown It's enough.
#unknown It better be.
#unknown Whatever you got planned, you best pull the ripcord while you still have a chance.
#unknown Where is it?  Mike  Mike!  Get out of my way.
#unknown You sit down.
#unknown Mike! Mike! Hold on, okay?  I am gonna count to three.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White's got an idea.
#unknown Mike, I'm serious.
#unknown One.
#unknown Two.
#unknown It's a great idea.
#unknown Look, you get your 5 million, we both do, and he gets his methylamine, all right? Just hear him out.
#unknown Is that true, Walter? Everybody wins.
#unknown
