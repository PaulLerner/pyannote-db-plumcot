hank_schrader  heading back
hank_schrader  out after this.
marie_schrader  Now?
marie_schrader  You worked all night.
marie_schrader  Get some sleep, Hank.
marie_schrader  Those RVs aren't going anywhere.
hank_schrader  They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
hank_schrader  That's what they do.
marie_schrader  You know what I mean.
marie_schrader  I spoke with Blanca.
marie_schrader  She said that Steven's going to El Paso?
marie_schrader  I was just wondering how you feel about that.
hank_schrader  it down.
hank_schrader  End of story
marie_schrader  Good
marie_schrader  good.
marie_schrader  Jesus, God knows I'm relieved. Yeah
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, I needed some time here because I'm deep into this investigation and couldn't do both, so I made a judgment call.
marie_schrader  You know that you can talk to me about things, right?
marie_schrader  You don't have to go through this alone
hank_schrader  you ask me which lead bib to put on someone before you nuke them?
hank_schrader  Jesus, Marie.
hank_schrader  I made a decision.
hank_schrader  I'm not going through anything.
hank_schrader  doing my job.
marie_schrader  I would like I
hank_schrader  I know,
hank_schrader  I know,
hank_schrader  a condo in Georgetown.
hank_schrader  I
marie_schrader  If you would let me finish, I was going to say I'd like to be included.
marie_schrader  That's all
hank_schrader  Don't you worry about my career.
hank_schrader  career is just fine.
marie_schrader  Did you not want to go?
marie_schrader  I don't blame you.
marie_schrader  I just
hank_schrader  Aren't you late for work or something
marie_schrader  I mean, what happened last time, it would make perfect sense for you to not want to go back.
hank_schrader  I'm on to some important stuff right here, right now,
hank_schrader  and Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to do with it.
hank_schrader  Anyone who doubts that I'm doing some actual good out here, and all I get are these bullshit accusations!
hank_schrader  What, everyone thinks I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.
walter_white  But I'm onto something.
walter_white  I'll tell you what I think it is.
walter_white  A ploy.
walter_white  A ploy to get me cooking again
walter_white  an obvious one at that
gustavo_fring  How do you mean?
walter_white  As if I would seriously believe you would hire an addict.
walter_white  Jesse Pinkman?
walter_white  Recovering or not
gustavo_fring  not You vouched for him previously. I
gustavo_fring  I took you at your word.
walter_white  No
walter_white  No, no, no, no,
walter_white  let me be clear.
walter_white  Let me be perfectly clear.
walter_white  Jesse was capable of working under my supervision.
walter_white  Trusting him with a solo venture, that's quite another matter
walter_white  How he could possibly produce anything other than a mediocre product at best. I
gustavo_fring  I am told his product was more or less consistent with the quality I had come to expect.
walter_white  More or less?
walter_white  More or less?
walter_white  Really?
walter_white  Boy, that is the Talk about setting the bar low.
walter_white  Except you don't do that set the bar low.
walter_white  Therefore, what conclusion am I left to draw?
walter_white  That you believe I have some proprietary kind of selfishness about my own formula.
walter_white  Some sort of overweening pride, I suppose, that you think simply overwhelms me, clouds my judgment.
gustavo_fring  But it doesn't.
walter_white  Absolutely not
walter_white  I simply respect the chemistry.
walter_white  chemistry must be respected.
gustavo_fring  I apologize for being so transparent.
gustavo_fring  Would you take a drive with me
gustavo_fring  I'd like to show you something.
skyler_white  Is everything okay?
marie_schrader  She's already finished an entire bottle, but she still seemed hungry.
marie_schrader  Than she fell asleep.
marie_schrader  I was thinking I'd give her another when she wakes up.
skyler_white  Yeah yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
skyler_white  Fatten that baby up.
skyler_white  Umwas that it
marie_schrader  So where are you.
marie_schrader  Are you at work? Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.
skyler_white  I
skyler_white  shouldn't be
skyler_white  be much longer. Is
marie_schrader  Is that okay? You
marie_schrader  You know I love my little Pookums.
marie_schrader  can leave her with me for the next 18 years as far as I'm concerned.
skyler_white  Great.
skyler_white  Thanks, Marie.
skyler_white  you Are you sure you're okay?
skyler_white  it? Come
skyler_white  It's
marie_schrader  Hank.
skyler_white  What about
skyler_white  him?
marie_schrader  I don't know how to talk to him
marie_schrader  I don't know what to say to him anymore. I
marie_schrader  I don't know how to
marie_schrader  Ever since El Paso Ever since maybe before Yeah. God
skyler_white  went through
skyler_white  down there.
marie_schrader  People blown up right in front of him, blood everywhere, and last week El Paso said they want him back. Yeah?
skyler_white  He's
marie_schrader  He's not going.
marie_schrader  Steve Gomez is going in his place, and I don't know how I feel about that.
skyler_white  he's certainly a lot safer up here, isn't he?
marie_schrader  Of course, and I want him safe.
marie_schrader  I can't tell what he wants.
marie_schrader  He won't talk to me.
marie_schrader  He hardly even comes home.
marie_schrader  He works all day, all night. Barely eats
marie_schrader  eats, barely speaks to me. It's
marie_schrader  something's eating him away from inside.
marie_schrader  He's just not the same.
marie_schrader  He's not.
marie_schrader  Facing death, it changes a person.
marie_schrader  It has to, don't you think?
marie_schrader  I guess you've notice a change in Walt.
gustavo_fring  Please.
gustavo_fring  Your new lab.
walter_white  Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.
walter_white  Look at the size of this reaction vessel.
walter_white  Why,
walter_white  that's got to be 1,200 liters. Where
walter_white  Where How
walter_white  How did you know how to put this all together?
gustavo_fring  I had excellent help, as will you.
gustavo_fring  Quite a lot of planning went into this.
walter_white  I would say so.
gustavo_fring  The laundry upstairs I've owned it for years.
gustavo_fring  It receives large chemical deliveries on a weekly basis detergent and such.
gustavo_fring  There is nothing suspicious about it, and my employees, to be sure, are welltrained, trustworthy.
gustavo_fring  The filtration system is stateoftheart. It
gustavo_fring  It will vent nothing but clean, odorless steam, just as the laundry does, and through the very same stacks.
gustavo_fring  I need 200 pounds per week to make this economically viable.
gustavo_fring  You would choose your own hours, of course, come and go as you please so long as the quota is met.
walter_white  answer is still no.
walter_white  I have made a series of very bad decisions, and I cannot make another one.
gustavo_fring  Why did you make these decisions?
walter_white  the good of my family.
gustavo_fring  Then they weren't bad decisions.
gustavo_fring  What does a man do, Walter? A
gustavo_fring  his family.
walter_white  This cost me my family.
gustavo_fring  When you have children, you always have family.
gustavo_fring  They will always be your priority, your responsibility
gustavo_fring  and a man a man provides.
gustavo_fring  And he does it even when he's not appreciated or respected or even loved.
gustavo_fring  He simply bears up, and he does it because he's a man.
ted_beneke  Ted Any chance we could grab a quick bite?
ted_beneke  place around the corner's pretty good.
skyler_white  I really gotta head home.
ted_beneke  All right, rain check, then.
walter_white_jr.  She said it was the tofu.
walter_white_jr.  Whatever.
walter_white_jr.  She's still cute anyways.
walter_white_jr.  great great dinner,
walter_white_jr.  can I be can I be excused?
skyler_white  To do homework or to play videogames?
walter_white_jr.  I can multitask.
hank_schrader  Give me something, Andy.
hank_schrader  Come on.
hank_schrader  tell me you're joking. Welded onto the back of a house.
hank_schrader  Wow, that's classy.

steven_gomez  all. Wanna know how to say" Get bent" in Spanish?
hank_schrader  don't go native on me, all right?
hank_schrader  Hey,
hank_schrader  Know your enemy and
hank_schrader  good fight,
hank_schrader  we got to drink around here?
janice  Your hunch was right.
janice  One more RV.
janice  DMV said the registration wasn't renewed, but then they realized it was never filed as nonoperational or destroyed.
janice  No police report, either.
skyler_white  what the hell I'm doing anymore, you know? It's like
skyler_white  I'm paralyzed, like if I take a step in any direction, I'm going to make a spectacular mistake.
skyler_white  God
skyler_white  God, I could go for a glass of wine about now. You want to go to Sorry
skyler_white  mind.
skyler_white  Anyway, breaking news is I am sleeping with my boss, and I don't know why.
skyler_white  That's a lie. I do know why.
skyler_white  mean, he's a lovely guy
skyler_white  guy. He's He's a really good person, but, I mean, it's not like we're ever
skyler_white  Somehow, and I can't actually believe it, but my entire family sees me as some sort of
skyler_white  my own sister, my brotherinlaw.
skyler_white  My teenage son tells me I'm a bitch.
skyler_white  And you say tell him the truth.
skyler_white  him about his father, but I can'tever.
skyler_white  How could I
skyler_white  And this man that I'm seeing, you know, as wrong as I know it is, as much as I know I'm probably doing it just to make Walt leave me, it is the only thing in my day where I don't feel like I'm drowning.
pamela  So he knows about this other man?
skyler_white  Yeah.
pamela  So then he'll sign?
skyler_white  Walt says he's not going anywhere, so that's a that's a really brilliant gambit on my part.
skyler_white  Genius.
skyler_white  He keeps money in the house.
pamela  Your husband, the drug dealer?
pamela  How much money?
skyler_white  I didn't count it.
skyler_white  It's heavy.
skyler_white  bag where he keeps it.
pamela  Are you asking my permission to spend this money?
skyler_white  No.
skyler_white  God, no.
skyler_white  I
skyler_white  No, I'm just, you know
skyler_white  I'm just trying to just talk it through.
skyler_white  That's
pamela  Let me just say that I'm half as qualified and twice the price of a therapist.
pamela  There is nothing to discuss here,
skyler_white  Skyler. I'm just saying, you know?
skyler_white  We have a history.
skyler_white  He's the father of my children, and maybe what he did, he He did
pamela  did it for the family.
pamela  Right?
pamela  Well, guess what.
pamela  That is one enormous load of horse shit.
skyler_white  Okay.
pamela  I'm going to spell this out as simply as I can for you.
pamela  You are a fool to stay in that house one minute longer.
pamela  If your husband won't leave, then you go.
pamela  You are now an accessory after the fact.
pamela  You are culpable.
pamela  You, your children, you could lose everything you own.
pamela  Do you understand?
pamela  All courtesy of this criminal you refuse to divorce.
skyler_white  I didn't marry a criminal.
pamela  Well, you're married to one now.
saul_goodman  Hows about we run through this thing one more time, especially the part where I do all the talking and you don't say jack?
jesse_pinkman  I'm going to say jack.
jesse_pinkman  I'm going to say plenty.
saul_goodman  What did we say about escalating, huh?
saul_goodman  Who's got your back here, hm?
saul_goodman  Me. All right?

walter_white  precisely nothing.
saul_goodman  Really? of all future profits from his solo venture is
saul_goodman  money you get paid for walking down to the mailbox.
saul_goodman  Consider it a gesture of respect for your valuable contributions to the business thus far.

saul_goodman  He must not have realized that you two had come to a parting of the ways.
walter_white  Take it

walter_white  Spend it in good health.
walter_white  That is the last money you'll ever earn in this business.
jesse_pinkman  the hell is that supposed to mean?
walter_white  Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse, but our mutual associate was only using you to get to me.
jesse_pinkman  you talking about?
walter_white  see, he needs someone with expertise, someone who knows what he's doing.
walter_white  In other words, he needs me.

mrs_ortega  I just didn't get around to it.
hank_schrader  May I ask why?
hank_schrader  I mean it's a it's a great way to get the family together for an affordable vacation.
hank_schrader  It must've been quite a blow when it went missing.
mrs_ortega  It was.
hank_schrader  Do you have any ideas at all who might've taken it?
mrs_ortega  I didn't want him arrested.
mrs_ortega  He ran with a bad crowd, but he was never a bad person.
