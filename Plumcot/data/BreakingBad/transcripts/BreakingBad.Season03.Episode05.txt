#unknown There's no cook.
#unknown Could be they're setting up.
#unknown I heard movement inside.

#unknown Where you headed? Texas.
#unknown [door opens, closes] [Marie] Hey, there.
#unknown Hank? Hank? [knocks on door] Can I come in? [Hank sighs] Hey, babe.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown How did it go last night? Good.
#unknown Catch the bad guys? Uh, nope.
#unknown Want me to make you some breakfast? Nah.
#unknown I'm I'm heading back out after this.
#unknown Now? You worked all night.
#unknown Get some sleep, Hank.
#unknown Those RVs aren't going anywhere.
#unknown They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
#unknown That's what they do.
#unknown You know what I mean.
#unknown I spoke with Blanca.
#unknown She said that Steven's going to El Paso? Yeah.
#unknown I was just wondering how you feel about that.
#unknown I turned it down.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown Good, good.
#unknown Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.
#unknown Yeah, well, I needed some time here because I'm deep into this investigation and couldn't do both, so I made a judgment call.
#unknown You know that you can talk to me about things, right? You don't have to go through this alone.
#unknown [sighs] Do you ask me which lead bib to put on someone before you nuke them? Jesus, Marie.
#unknown I made a decision.
#unknown I'm not going through anything.
#unknown I'm doing my job.
#unknown I would like I know, I know, a condo in Georgetown.
#unknown I know.
#unknown If you would let me finish, I was going to say I'd like to be included.
#unknown That's all.
#unknown Don't you worry about my career.
#unknown My career is just fine.
#unknown Did you not want to go? I don't blame you.
#unknown I just Aren't you late for work or something? I mean, what happened last time, it would make perfect sense for you to not want to go back.
#unknown I'm on to some important stuff right here, right now, and Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to do with it.
#unknown Anyone who doubts that I'm doing some actual good out here, and all I get are these bullshit accusations! What, everyone thinks I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.
#unknown But I'm onto something.
#unknown I know it.
#unknown You understand me? You hear me? [Walt] What exactly is this? I'll tell you what I think it is.
#unknown A ploy.
#unknown A ploy to get me cooking again And an obvious one at that.
#unknown How do you mean? As if I would seriously believe you would hire an addict.
#unknown Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not You vouched for him previously.
#unknown I took you at your word.
#unknown No, no, no, no, let me be clear.
#unknown Let me be perfectly clear.
#unknown Jesse was capable of working under my supervision.
#unknown Trusting him with a solo venture, that's quite another matter.
#unknown How he could possibly produce anything other than a mediocre product at best.
#unknown I am told his product was more or less consistent with the quality I had come to expect.
#unknown More or less? More or less? Really? Wow.
#unknown Boy, that is the Talk about setting the bar low.
#unknown Except you don't do that set the bar low.
#unknown Therefore, what conclusion am I left to draw? Hm? That you believe I have some proprietary kind of selfishness about my own formula.
#unknown Hm? Some sort of overweening pride, I suppose, that you think simply overwhelms me, clouds my judgment.
#unknown But it doesn't.
#unknown Absolutely not.
#unknown I simply respect the chemistry.
#unknown The chemistry must be respected.
#unknown I apologize for being so transparent.
#unknown Would you take a drive with me? I'd like to show you something.
#unknown [sighs] [cell phone rings] [ring] Hi.
#unknown Is everything okay? She's already finished an entire bottle, but she still seemed hungry.
#unknown Than she fell asleep.
#unknown I was thinking I'd give her another when she wakes up.
#unknown Yeah yeah, yeah, absolutely.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Fatten that baby up.
#unknown Will do.
#unknown Umwas that it? So where are you.
#unknown Are you at work? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, I'm at work.
#unknown I I shouldn't be much longer.
#unknown Is that okay? You know I love my little Pookums.
#unknown You can leave her with me for the next 18 years as far as I'm concerned.
#unknown [laughs] Great.
#unknown Thanks, Marie.
#unknown Are you Are you sure you're okay? Sweetie, what is it? Come on.
#unknown It's Hank.
#unknown What about him? I don't know how to talk to him.
#unknown I don't know what to say to him anymore.
#unknown I don't know how to Ever since El Paso Ever since maybe before Yeah.
#unknown God knows he went through a lot down there.
#unknown People blown up right in front of him, blood everywhere, and last week El Paso said they want him back.
#unknown Yeah? He's not going.
#unknown Steve Gomez is going in his place, and I don't know how I feel about that.
#unknown Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here, isn't he? Of course, and I want him safe.
#unknown I can't tell what he wants.
#unknown He won't talk to me.
#unknown He hardly even comes home.
#unknown He works all day, all night.
#unknown Barely eats, barely speaks to me.
#unknown It's like something's eating him away from inside.
#unknown He's just not the same.
#unknown He's not.
#unknown Facing death, it changes a person.
#unknown It has to, don't you think? I guess you've notice a change in Walt.
#unknown Please.
#unknown [machine whining] [buzzes] What is this? Your new lab.
#unknown My God.
#unknown Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.
#unknown [chuckles] Look at the size of this reaction vessel.
#unknown Why, that's got that's got to be 1,200 liters.
#unknown Where Where How did you know how to put this all together? I had excellent help, as will you.
#unknown Quite a lot of planning went into this.
#unknown I would say so.
#unknown The laundry upstairs I've owned it for years.
#unknown It receives large chemical deliveries on a weekly basis detergent[ and such.
#unknown There is nothing suspicious about it, and my employees, to be sure, are welltrained, trustworthy.
#unknown The filtration system is stateoftheart.
#unknown It will vent nothing but clean, odorless steam, just as the laundry does, and through the very same stacks.
#unknown I need 200 pounds per week to make this economically viable.
#unknown You would choose your own hours, of course, come and go as you please so long as the quota is met.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown The answer is still no.
#unknown I have made a series of very bad decisions, and I cannot make another one.
#unknown Why did you make these decisions? For the good of my family.
#unknown Then they weren't bad decisions.
#unknown What does a man do, Walter? A man provides for his family.
#unknown This cost me my family.
#unknown When you have children, you always have family.
#unknown They will always be your priority, your responsibility, and a man a man provides.
#unknown And he does it even when he's not appreciated or respected or even loved.
#unknown He simply bears up, and he does it because he's a man.
#unknown [Ted] Any chance we could grab a quick bite? Thai place around the corner's pretty good.
#unknown Um, I really gotta head home.
#unknown All right, rain check, then.
#unknown [Walter, Jr.
#unknown ] She said it was the tofu.
#unknown [laughs] Whatever.
#unknown She's still cute anyways.
#unknown Uh, great great dinner, Mom.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown [laughs] Um, can I be can I be excused? To do homework or to play videogames? I can multitask.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown [baby coos] [baby babbles] [whining] You want to take her? Yeah.
#unknown [cooing] Mmhm.
#unknown [Hank] Give me something, Andy.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Please tell me you're joking.
#unknown Welded onto the back of a house.
#unknown Wow, that's classy.
#unknown Christ.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay, thanks.
#unknown Hey, Janice.
#unknown Janice.
#unknown That the last one? Yeah.
#unknown Sorry, hank.
#unknown That's all DMV had registered in New Mexico.
#unknown Could you check again? [sighs] Now? Can I do it after the party? Janice, I'm I'm dead in the water here.
#unknown Okay, I'll check.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown [chattering] Gomie, time for the little bird to fly the nest, huh? [chuckles] They got the right guy for the job, specially since the beanspeak comes natural and all.
#unknown Wanna know how to say "Get bent" in Spanish? [laughs] Just don't go native on me, all right? Oh, uh Hey, uh here.
#unknown Know your enemy and all.
#unknown Fight the good fight, brother.
#unknown I will.
#unknown What have we got to drink around here? Your hunch was right.
#unknown One more RV.
#unknown DMV said the registration wasn't renewed, but then they realized it was never filed as nonoperational or destroyed.
#unknown No police report, either.
#unknown [grunts] [sighs] [Skyler] I just don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore, you know? It's like I'm paralyzed, like if I take a step in any direction, I'm going to make a spectacular mistake.
#unknown God, I could go for a glass of wine about now.
#unknown You want to go to Sorry, never mind.
#unknown [gags] Anyway, breaking news is I am sleeping with my boss, and I don't know why.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown Yep.
#unknown That's a lie.
#unknown I do know why.
#unknown I mean, he's a lovely guy.
#unknown He's He's a really good person, but, I mean, it's not like we're ever gonna Somehow, and I can't actually believe it, but my entire family sees me as some sort of my own sister, my brotherinlaw.
#unknown My teenage son tells me I'm a bitch.
#unknown And you say tell him the truth.
#unknown Tell him about his father, but I can'tever.
#unknown How could I? And this man that I'm seeing, you know, as wrong as I know it is, as much as I know I'm probably doing it just to make Walt leave me, it is the only thing in my day where I don't feel like I'm drowning.
#unknown So he knows about this other man? Yeah.
#unknown So then he'll sign? Um, Walt says he's not going anywhere, so that's a that's a really brilliant gambit on my part.
#unknown Yep.
#unknown Genius.
#unknown He keeps money in the house.
#unknown Your husband, the drug dealer? How much money? I didn't count it.
#unknown It's It's heavy.
#unknown The bag where he keeps it.
#unknown Are you asking my permission to spend this money? No.
#unknown God, no.
#unknown I No, I'm just, you know I'm just trying to just talk it through.
#unknown That's Let me just say that I'm half as qualified and twice the price of a therapist.
#unknown There is nothing to discuss here, Skyler.
#unknown I'm just saying, you know? We have a history.
#unknown He's the father of my children, and maybe what he did, he He did it for the family.
#unknown Right? Well, guess what.
#unknown That is one enormous load of horse shit.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'm going to spell this out as simply as I can for you.
#unknown You are a fool to stay in that house one minute longer.
#unknown If your husband won't leave, then you go.
#unknown You are now an accessory after the fact.
#unknown You are culpable.
#unknown You, your children, you could lose everything you own.
#unknown Do you understand? All courtesy of this criminal you refuse to divorce.
#unknown I didn't marry a criminal.
#unknown Well, you're married to one now.
#unknown Hows about we run through this thing one more time, especially the part where I do all the talking and you don't say jack? Oh, I'm going to say jack.
#unknown I'm going to say plenty.
#unknown What did we say about escalating, huh? Who's got your back here, hm? Me.
#unknown All right? I'm going to take care of things.
#unknown Hey, what are the parameters of this sobriety thing you got going? What do you mean? Can you take a Xanax? 'Cause I got a drawer full of them.
#unknown I get them from my "chiropractor.
#unknown " Vietnamese, 5 foot tall, she adjusts you to completion.
#unknown [chuckles] Her name's Kim Nu Suong, as delicious as it sounds.
#unknown I should give you her card.
#unknown To hell with this.
#unknown [intercom buzzes] Uh Send him in.
#unknown Hello, Walt.
#unknown Good to see you.
#unknown Please, have a seat here.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Pinkman, if you will.
#unknown You're late.
#unknown Gentlemen, if we could come to some accommodation here now.
#unknown There's always a way to oil everyone's lock.
#unknown This young man is prepared to offer you a sweetheart of a deal doing precisely nothing.
#unknown Really? of all future profits from his solo venture is money you get paid for walking down to the mailbox.
#unknown Consider it a gesture of respect for your valuable contributions to the business thus far.
#unknown I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.
#unknown That's charity, is what that is.
#unknown I do all the work.
#unknown He sits around on his fat a judging people.
#unknown [Saul] Hey, hey, hey.
#unknown Escalating.
#unknown Stop.
#unknown Sohere's that, but then there's one small detail.
#unknown Clearly a mistake was made on the part of our mutual associate when he paid you half of Jesse's earnings.
#unknown He must not have realized that you two had come to a parting of the ways.
#unknown Take it.
#unknown It belongs to you.
#unknown You're damn right it belongs to me.
#unknown I knew I could count on you boys to play nice.
#unknown That's That almost brings a tear to my eye.
#unknown Enjoy it.
#unknown Spend it in good health.
#unknown That is the last money you'll ever earn in this business.
#unknown What the hell is that supposed to mean? Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse, but our mutual associate was only using you to get to me.
#unknown What are you talking about? You see, he needs someone with expertise, someone who knows what he's doing.
#unknown In other words, he needs me.
#unknown You're telling me you're cooking again? Yeah, uh How should I put this? I'm in.
#unknown You're out.
#unknown Whoa, whoa, Walt, hold on there.
#unknown Uh, what was the offer, if I may ask? It's, uh, 3 million for three months of my time.
#unknown What You're gonna need that money laundered, right? I mean, of course.
#unknown What was our deal before? That's a shade high.
#unknown Let's settle on an even 15.
#unknown That's a nice round number.
#unknown For old time's sake, 12.
#unknown I'm a reasonable guy.
#unknown It's a shortterm deal.
#unknown any lower and still respect myself.
#unknown just happened? You're my lawyer, not his! That's the way of the world, kid.
#unknown You go with the winner.
#unknown You think this'll stop me from cooking? Cook whatever you like As long as it's that ridiculous "Chili P" or some other drek, but don't even think about using my formula.
#unknown Just try and stop me, bitch.
#unknown [door buzzing] Yes? Hi, there, uh, Mrs.
#unknown Ortega? Yes.
#unknown Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.
#unknown I'm with the Drug Enforcement Administration.
#unknown We're interested in an RV that's registered to your name and address.
#unknown Uh, do you have an RV? I did.
#unknown It was stolen months ago.
#unknown Stolen, huh? Well, then I'm curious as to why the theft was never reported.
#unknown I'm not seeing any records of it with the police or the DMV.
#unknown I just didn't get around to it.
#unknown May I ask why? I mean it's a it's a great way to get the family together for an affordable vacation.
#unknown It must've been quite a blow when it went missing.
#unknown It was.
#unknown Do you have any ideas at all who might've taken it? I didn't want him arrested.
#unknown He ran with a bad crowd, but he was never a bad person.
#unknown I thought he could turn his life around.
#unknown Who are we talking about, Mrs.
#unknown Ortega? My son.
#unknown I'd really like to speak with him.
#unknown He's passed away.
#unknown He was shot two months ago.
#unknown What was your son's name? Christian.
#unknown Christian Ortega.
#unknown Was his nickname "Combo"? Thanks for this.
#unknown I really appreciate it.
#unknown
