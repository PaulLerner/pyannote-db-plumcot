gustavo_fring  is gonna need me
gale_boetticher  Very, very well.
gale_boetticher  It's a flurry of deliveries.
gale_boetticher  Feels like Christmas morning.
gale_boetticher  exciting.
gale_boetticher  It's really coming together.
gale_boetticher  And I would like to point out that if you have any very understandable questions about the price tag
gale_boetticher  That sound Quality
gale_boetticher  At
gale_boetticher  Pfizer, at Merck, that unit would be right at home
gale_boetticher  That goes for all of it
gustavo_fring  I want
gustavo_fring  to have what you need
gale_boetticher  Oh. Well, I doff my proverbial cap to you, sir.
gustavo_fring  do you think we'll be up
gale_boetticher  Within a month, I'd say.
victor  Two weeks.
gale_boetticher  Uh, yeah, two weeks.
gustavo_fring  good.
gale_boetticher  By the way, that sample you asked me to run,
gale_boetticher  I ran it, and it is quite good. Thank
gustavo_fring  you very much, Gale.
gustavo_fring  You can give that to Victor
gale_boetticher  to discard
gale_boetticher  Is that our competition?
gustavo_fring  sorry?
gale_boetticher  The,
gale_boetticher  It really is quite good.
gale_boetticher  The purity, of course, I'm speaking of, speaking strictly in chemical terms.
gale_boetticher  And I can't, as of yet, account for the blue color, but, uh if that is our competition, we have our work cut out for us, so to speak. You
gustavo_fring  You don't have any competition, Gale, not as far as
gustavo_fring  I'm concerned. After all,
gale_boetticher  Well, it can be pretty darn pure.
gale_boetticher  Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you a purity of 96%.
gale_boetticher  proud of that figure.
gale_boetticher  It's a hardearned figure, 96.
gale_boetticher  However, this other product is 99,
gale_boetticher  maybe even a touch beyond that.
gale_boetticher  I'd need an instrument called a gas chromatograph to say for sure, but, uh, that last 3%, it may not sound like a lot, but it is.
gale_boetticher  It's tremendous.
gale_boetticher  It's a tremendous gulf. Gale
gustavo_fring  for our purposes, Please, don't let this
gustavo_fring  you. Yeah
gale_boetticher  It's just
gale_boetticher  I'd love to know who synthesized it is all. A man who wants to work with me. A trained chemist, like yourself. But it won't happen.
gustavo_fring  don't consider him a professional
gustavo_fring  If
gale_boetticher  If he's not, I don't know what that makes me.
gale_boetticher  I'm not trying to talk myself out of
gustavo_fring  of a job. With this person, there are

hank_schrader  And I had maybe this much less shit in my pants,
hank_schrader  so yeah, Marie, if you and him and everybody else in America secretly took a vote and changed the meaning of the entire English language, yeah, I guess I broke new ground.

walter_white  All right, I just want to go on record we should all be wearing masks. We should
walter_white  be wearing masks.
walter_white  he forgets the aluminum.
walter_white  Guaranteed.
walter_white  Guarantee he forgets.
walter_white  Oh, you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you
walter_white  forgot the aluminum.
walter_white  the first steps in
walter_white  right, let's talk about Gale Boetticher.
walter_white  He was a good man and a good chemist, and I cared about him
walter_white  He didn't deserve what happened to him.
walter_white  He didn't deserve it at all.
walter_white  But I'd shoot him again tomorrow and the next day and the day after that.
walter_white  When you make it Gale versus me or Gale versus Jesse, Gale loses, simple as that.
walter_white  This is on you, Gus
walter_white  Not me, not Jesse.
walter_white  Gale's death is on you.
walter_white  I mean, really, what did you expect me to do, just simply roll over and allow you to murder us?
walter_white  wouldn't take measures Extreme measures to defend
walter_white  defend myself
walter_white  Think again.
walter_white  And whatever Whatever it is you're planning there, whatever Whatever it is The point that you're trying to make here, let me Let me suggest that you keep one thing in mind.
walter_white  Without us, without Jesse and myself, you have no one to make your product.
walter_white  Certainly not him.
walter_white  This This person doesn't know what the hell he's doing!
victor  Been watching him for weeks.
victor  know every step of his cook.
walter_white  Do you really? You
walter_white  Really?
walter_white  Oh, so please tell me.
walter_white  Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic or aprotic?
walter_white  Because I forget.
walter_white  And if our reduction is not stereospecific, then how can our product be enantiomerically pure?
walter_white  I mean, is 1 phenyl, 1 hyrdoxyl, containing, of course, chiral centers at carbons number 1 and 2 on the propane chain?
walter_white  Then reduction to methamphetamine eliminates which chiral center is it again?
walter_white  Because I forgot.
walter_white  Come on, help me out, professor!
walter_white  We're here.
walter_white  Come
walter_white  Let us work.
victor  All his bullshit aside, it's called a cook.
victor  See, everything comes down to following a recipe.
victor  Simple, complicated, it doesn't matter.
victor  The steps never change, and I know every step.
walter_white  Oh, is Is that what you want?
walter_white  This This short order cook?
walter_white  You're not flipping hamburgers here
walter_white  What happens when you get a bad barrel of precursor? Or
walter_white  Or how would you even know it?
walter_white  And what happens in the summer when When When the humidity rises and your product goes cloudy?
walter_white  HHow would you guard against that?
walter_white  You do this, all you'll have left is an $8 million hole in the ground.
walter_white  This lab This equipment is useless without us.
walter_white  Without Without Jesse and myself, you have no new product. You
walter_white  You You You have no income.
walter_white  Your people out there will not be paid.
walter_white  Your distribution chain collapses.
walter_white  Without us you have nothing.
walter_white  You kill me, you have nothing.
walter_white  You kill Jesse, you don't have me.
walter_white  You're too smart
walter_white  You can't afford to do this.
walter_white  Please.
walter_white  just go back to work.
walter_white  here.
walter_white  Let us work.
walter_white  We're We're We're ready to go to work.
walter_white  We'll just pick up right where we left off.
gustavo_fring  Get back to
walter_white  We'll put him
walter_white  in feet first.
walter_white  Grab his shoe
walter_white  Oh.
walter_white  Here. Wait,
walter_white  wait. Just lift him up
walter_white  There
walter_white  There.

walter_white  I hope you understand that.
walter_white  Thoughts
walter_white  Thoughts? Got any thoughts on what our next move might be?
jesse_pinkman  at the
walter_white  first opportunity Gus will kill us.
jesse_pinkman  What, that wasn't an opportunity just now?
jesse_pinkman  Seemed like a pretty damn good opportunity to me.
walter_white  No, no. Golden
jesse_pinkman  Golden, I would say.
walter_white  We bought ourselves some time. Uhuh.
walter_white  question is how
walter_white  He'll be looking for another
jesse_pinkman  chemist. He's not going to find another chemist.
jesse_pinkman  Where is he going to find another chemist?
jesse_pinkman  It's not just about somebody being able to run a lab that big.
jesse_pinkman  Someone he can trust, someone he knows will keep their mouths shut.
jesse_pinkman  Good
jesse_pinkman  Good luck with that.
jesse_pinkman  took him years to find Gale.
jesse_pinkman  Bet he's sorry now.
walter_white  you sure you're okay? At least
jesse_pinkman  least now we all understand each other.
walter_white  Right? What do you mean?
jesse_pinkman  I mean him and us, we get it.
jesse_pinkman  We're all on the same page.
walter_white  What page
jesse_pinkman  is that? The one that says if
jesse_pinkman  I can't kill you, you'll shit wish you were
jesse_pinkman  dead. Yo. Excuse me.
skyler_white  Thanks. Here. Thanks. Hi. Hi.
