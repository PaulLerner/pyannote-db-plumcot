#unknown Last season on AMC's Breaking Bad You're a drug dealer.
#unknown I'm a manufacturer.
#unknown I'm not a dealer.
#unknown Grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
#unknown You're my new lab assistant.
#unknown Gale Boetticher.
#unknown They're assassins.
#unknown I believe I was their prime target.
#unknown They were steered away from me to my brother in law.
#unknown It's tens of thousands of dollars.
#unknown We have the money.
#unknown You are not in this.
#unknown How I am not in this? I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself.
#unknown It comes down to you and me versus him.
#unknown I'm sorry, but it's gonna be him.
#unknown They got me in the laundry and they're going to kill me.
#unknown Do it! Just what the hell was that? You might wanna hold off.
#unknown Why? Because your boss is gonna need me.
#unknown How's it coming? Very, very well.
#unknown It's a flurry of deliveries.
#unknown Feels like Christmas morning.
#unknown Ah, it's exciting.
#unknown It's really coming together.
#unknown And I would like to point out that if you have any very understandable questions about the price tag That sound Quality.
#unknown At Pfizer, at Merck, that unit would be right at home.
#unknown That goes for all of it.
#unknown Good.
#unknown I want you to have what you need.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Well, I doff my proverbial cap to you, sir.
#unknown When do you think we'll be up and running? Within a month, I'd say.
#unknown Two weeks.
#unknown Uh, yeah, two weeks.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Very good.
#unknown By the way, that sample you asked me to run, I ran it, and it is quite good.
#unknown Thank you very much, Gale.
#unknown You can give that to Victor to discard.
#unknown Uh, sure.
#unknown Is that our competition? I'm sorry? The, uh It really is quite good.
#unknown The purity, of course, I'm speaking of, speaking strictly in chemical terms.
#unknown And I can't, as of yet, account for the blue color, but, uh if that is our competition, we have our work cut out for us, so to speak.
#unknown You don't have any competition, Gale, not as far as I'm concerned.
#unknown After all, how pure can pure be? Well, it can be pretty darn pure.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Fring, I can guarantee you a purity of 96%.
#unknown I'm proud of that figure.
#unknown It's a hardearned figure, 96.
#unknown However, this other product is 99, maybe even a touch beyond that.
#unknown I'd need an instrument called a gas chromatograph to say for sure, but, uh, that last 3%, it may not sound like a lot, but it is.
#unknown It's tremendous.
#unknown It's a tremendous gulf.
#unknown Gale, for our purposes, Please, don't let this trouble you.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's just I'd love to know who synthesized it is all.
#unknown A man who wants to work with me.
#unknown A trained chemist, like yourself.
#unknown But it won't happen.
#unknown I don't consider him a professional.
#unknown If he's not, I don't know what that makes me.
#unknown I'm not trying to talk myself out of a job.
#unknown With this person, there are other considerations.
#unknown His is the best I've ever seen, hands down.
#unknown And I look at this place that you've built, the money you're investing, sparing no expense.
#unknown And I know I know that you want the best.
#unknown Apartment 6.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Eubank's west.
#unknown It's between Eubank and Spain, But Mazatlan's closest.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown I just heard the one, just the one single, like, you know, like a backfire, like a truck backfiring.
#unknown I came out of my apartment A couple of us came out.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, nobody saw it.
#unknown Did you guys see anybody? Guys, did you? I don't know if they speak English too good.

#unknown No arguing or like that.

#unknown Tell me.
#unknown I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes, which is up from my 15 1/2 yesterday.
#unknown And I had maybe this much less shit in my pants, so yeah, Marie, if you and him and everybody else in America secretly took a vote and changed the meaning of the entire English language, yeah, I guess I broke new ground.
#unknown Well, call it a figure of speech, but I am seeing progress.
#unknown Definite progress.
#unknown You're ordering a new rock? I'm bidding on a new mineral.
#unknown It's a nice one.

#unknown I bet he forgets the aluminum.
#unknown Guaranteed.
#unknown Guarantee he forgets.
#unknown Oh, you don't know what the hell you're doing, do you? You forgot the aluminum.
#unknown One of the first steps in the Son of a bitch.
#unknown All right, let's talk about Gale Boetticher.
#unknown He was a good man and a good chemist, and I cared about him.
#unknown He didn't deserve what happened to him.
#unknown He didn't deserve it at all.
#unknown But I'd shoot him again tomorrow and the next day and the day after that.
#unknown When you make it Gale versus me or Gale versus Jesse, Gale loses, simple as that.
#unknown This is on you, Gus Not me, not Jesse.
#unknown Gale's death is on you.
#unknown I mean, really, what did you expect me to do, just simply roll over and allow you to murder us? That I wouldn't take measures Extreme measures to defend myself? Wrong! Think again.
#unknown And whatever Whatever it is you're planning there, whatever Whatever it is The point that you're trying to make here, let me Let me suggest that you keep one thing in mind.
#unknown Without us, without Jesse and myself, you have no one to make your product.
#unknown Certainly not him.
#unknown This This person doesn't know what the hell he's doing! Been watching him for weeks.
#unknown I know every step of his cook.
#unknown Do you really? You Really? Oh, so please tell me.
#unknown Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic or aprotic? Because I forget.
#unknown And if our reduction is not stereospecific, then how can our product be enantiomerically pure? I mean, is 1 phenyl, 1 hyrdoxyl, containing, of course, chiral centers at carbons number 1 and 2 on the propane chain? Then reduction to methamphetamine eliminates which chiral center is it again? Because I forgot.
#unknown Come on, help me out, professor! Gus.
#unknown We're here.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Let us work.
#unknown All his bullshit aside, it's called a cook.
#unknown See, everything comes down to following a recipe.
#unknown Simple, complicated, it doesn't matter.
#unknown The steps never change, and I know every step.
#unknown Oh, is Is that what you want? This This short order cook? You're not flipping hamburgers here, pal.
#unknown What happens when you get a bad barrel of precursor? Or how would you even know it? And what happens in the summer when When When the humidity rises and your product goes cloudy? HHow would you guard against that? Gus.
#unknown You do this, all you'll have left is an $8 million hole in the ground.
#unknown This lab This equipment is useless without us.
#unknown Without Without Jesse and myself, you have no new product.
#unknown You You You have no income.
#unknown Your people out there will not be paid.
#unknown Your distribution chain collapses.
#unknown Without us you have nothing.
#unknown You kill me, you have nothing.
#unknown You kill Jesse, you don't have me.
#unknown You won't do this.
#unknown You're too smart.
#unknown You can't afford to do this.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Let us just go back to work.
#unknown We're here.
#unknown Let us work.
#unknown We're We're We're ready to go to work.
#unknown We'll just pick up right where we left off.

#unknown How are you doing? No, I mean, you know How are you doing? You did the only thing that you could.
#unknown I hope you understand that.
#unknown Thoughts? Got any thoughts on what our next move might be? What next move? Our next move.
#unknown Our next move, given the fact that at the first opportunity Gus will kill us.
#unknown What, that wasn't an opportunity just now? Seemed like a pretty damn good opportunity to me.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Golden, I would say.
#unknown We bought ourselves some time.
#unknown Uhuh.
#unknown Yes, but The question is how much.
#unknown He'll be looking for another chemist.
#unknown He's not going to find another chemist.
#unknown Where is he going to find another chemist? It's not just about somebody being able to run a lab that big.
#unknown Someone he can trust, someone he knows will keep their mouths shut.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Good luck with that.
#unknown Bet it took him years to find Gale.
#unknown Bet he's sorry now.
#unknown Are you sure you're okay? At least now we all understand each other.
#unknown Right? What do you mean? I mean him and us, we get it.
#unknown We're all on the same page.
#unknown What page is that? The one that says if I can't kill you, you'll shit wish you were dead.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hi.
