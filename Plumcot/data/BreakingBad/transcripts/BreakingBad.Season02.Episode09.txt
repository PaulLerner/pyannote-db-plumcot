#unknown These people.
#unknown Pathetic.
#unknown I already read that one anyway.
#unknown Kleinman has better magazines.
#unknown You know, you guys really don't need to hang around.
#unknown We won't even get the results till next week.
#unknown Buddy, we're gonna be here.
#unknown You kidding me? It is a full PET/CT, correct? You definitely want the PET/CT and not just the PET.
#unknown Yeah, it's a PET/CT.
#unknown Good.
#unknown That's what you want.
#unknown Some places skimp and they only do the PET.
#unknown I'm not naming any names.
#unknown I just still don't understand why you don't go to Kleinman.
#unknown This is where WaIt's doctor is.
#unknown Well, with us, you wouldn't have to wait until next week to get the results.
#unknown I'm sorry, but these scans are not that difficult to read.
#unknown I could take one look at WaIt's and tell you immediately how he's doing.
#unknown Really.
#unknown Doctors like people to think that they're so much smarter than the technicians but you would be surprised how much they come to us for input.
#unknown Well, never turn down a chance to hit the bathroom, huh? Excuse me.
#unknown You all right in there? Yeah.
#unknown Hey, you okay? Yes.
#unknown I'm fine, thank you.
#unknown Sir, you can go back to your changing room and get dressed.
#unknown So how'd we do? You did fine.
#unknown See anything? I'm just a technician, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Dr.
#unknown Delcavoli will go over the results with you next week.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Actually, the moneylaundering aspect is fairly straightforward.
#unknown But I gotta tell you, the nottellingyourwife aspect? Most people wanna know why they suddenly got rich.
#unknown If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.
#unknown How much time they giving you? Weeks.
#unknown Maybe.
#unknown Sorry to hear it.
#unknown I was hoping we could make some real money together.
#unknown Oh, well.
#unknown Look, let's crunch some numbers.
#unknown How much money are we laundering? At this time, $16,000.
#unknown How long you been doing this? We've had some extenuating circumstances.
#unknown Yeah, apparently.
#unknown All right, 16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar minus my fee, which is 17 percent comes to $9960.
#unknown Congratulations, you just left your family a secondhand Subaru.
#unknown Well, we'll just have to cook more.
#unknown A lot more.
#unknown Yeah, that's my legal opinion.
#unknown Make hay while the sun is still shining.
#unknown You know, we should do something this weekend.
#unknown You know, get our minds off the test results.
#unknown Actually, l.
#unknown I'm thinking I should go see Mom.
#unknown Really? Yeah.
#unknown You know, I never did call her.
#unknown You're expecting the news from the scan to be bad.
#unknown God, Walt.
#unknown I need you to stay positive with me here.
#unknown I am.
#unknown Positive is good.
#unknown I'm all for positive but positive doesn't change facts, all right? It.
#unknown It doesn't change the need to be prepared.
#unknown I know.
#unknown Walt, I'm just trying to be hopeful, okay? You know, forgive me.
#unknown Look I need to know Mom's going to leave you something if If I'm no longer around.
#unknown I just need to get that straight, that's all.
#unknown And believe me, I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.
#unknown Complaining about her nurses the entire time.
#unknown "Juanita is hiding my ashtray.
#unknown " A 30minute discourse about how the sugar packets are suddenly disappearing.
#unknown And, oh, she's counting every one of them, you know.
#unknown I'll be lucky if I get a word in edgewise.
#unknown I actually think the news from the scan is gonna be good.
#unknown Perhaps you should prepare for that.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown We should do something.
#unknown Yeah, we should.
#unknown No, something else.
#unknown We should go somewhere.
#unknown Have you been to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum? Is that the one with the Abombs? Georgia O'Keeffe.
#unknown She's a painter.
#unknown You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe? No, is that bad? Boy, you need some educating.
#unknown Yes, yes, I do.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Why don't we go up to Santa Fe? We'll make a day of it.
#unknown You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe for a museum? So romantic.
#unknown Yup, we're going.
#unknown Get up.
#unknown Why can't we just go to the movies or puttputt? It's the shit.
#unknown A little culture won't kill you.
#unknown Besides, you might like it.
#unknown A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.
#unknown Really? ls there still cereal? Yeah.
#unknown Yo, if I know you, leave a message.
#unknown Where the hell are you? Pick up the phone.
#unknown Hello? Jesse, pick up Hold on, hold on.
#unknown Sorry, one sec.
#unknown What? I've been trying to reach you.
#unknown Where's your drop phone? I've been busy.
#unknown Well, clear your social calendar.
#unknown We have to cook.
#unknown What? Today? No, you'll need today at least to gather supplies.
#unknown Now, we're going to need all new glassware heating mantles, about a hundred pounds of ice.
#unknown Do you have a paper and pencil? You should be writing this down.
#unknown You wanna go shopping, go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.
#unknown Smoking marijuana, eating Cheetos and masturbating do not constitute plans in my book.
#unknown Well, screw you and your book, man, all right? I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe, not like you need to know.
#unknown You're going to a museum, huh? Yeah.
#unknown Georgia O'Keeffe.
#unknown Georgia O'Keeffe? She's a painter, duh.
#unknown She does these vagina pictures.
#unknown Or paintings, or just painted.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown What are you even talking about? Look, man, why am I even explaining myself to you, all right? It's none of your damn business what I'm doing.
#unknown All you need to know is I ain't cooking or shopping or whatever the hell.
#unknown Let me explain something to you.
#unknown You and I need to cook through to next Tuesday.
#unknown Tuesday? Four days straight? Like it or not, we have no choice.
#unknown Yeah? And why exactly is that? Our methylamine.
#unknown It's going bad.
#unknown What? It's losing its chemical potency.
#unknown Now, unless stealing another barrel sounds good to you.
#unknown Hell, no.
#unknown All right, we have to act fast, before it goes to waste.
#unknown You have a paper and pencil? Come on.
#unknown All right, all right.
#unknown Go.
#unknown Okay, six mantles.
#unknown Mantle? Mantle? What do you mean, mantle? You mean like Mickey? I really wish you didn't have to do this.
#unknown Me too.
#unknown But I'll be back before you know it and you can always call if you need me.
#unknown What, and risk talking to your mother? Have to be some emergency.
#unknown Love you.
#unknown Fly safe, okay? Okay.
#unknown The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
#unknown No parking.
#unknown Attention, passengers: Please maintain visual contact with your personal belongings at all times.
#unknown Any bags left unattended will be confiscated by airport personnel.
#unknown You brought a meth lab to the airport? What? You said we were in a hurry.
#unknown I saved us a trip.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Did you get everything? All six? Yeah.
#unknown With reflux condensers? Yes.
#unknown Like I said, yes.
#unknown Just go.
#unknown Drive.
#unknown Go, go.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Good morning to you too, man.
#unknown Stupid Three entire bags of Funyuns? What? Funyuns are awesome.
#unknown God.
#unknown Hey, more for me.
#unknown How about something with some protein maybe? Something green, huh? Man, I'm getting no service.
#unknown How are you even alive? Hey, yo, check your phone.
#unknown You get any bars? Yeah, I've got a signal.
#unknown Hey, let me use yours, would you? Absolutely not.
#unknown I have to assume Skyler checks my phone records.
#unknown You know that.
#unknown It's not business, all right? It's personal.
#unknown Oh, personal.
#unknown What, female? Maybe.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown That's all I need.
#unknown Skyler hits redial and some stripper answers.
#unknown Look, she's not a stripper, okay? Dickwad.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown My wife checks.
#unknown Drinking water? Yup.
#unknown Is that all we've got? Ten gallons? What, you plan on taking a bath in it? Oh, God.
#unknown No, not there.
#unknown That is our workstation.
#unknown Oh, our "workstation.
#unknown " That's right.
#unknown Why don't you try to find a place where it won't get lost? Considering it's our only set and we are a million miles from nowhere.
#unknown Why don't you try sticking them up your ass sideways? Twopointthreefive pounds.
#unknown Twopointthreefive.
#unknown That's the last of it.
#unknown How many total? Nineteen.
#unknown So dollarwise? How much? Well, median weight 2.
#unknown 2 pounds that's 41.
#unknown 8, call that 42 pounds, at.
#unknown What are we selling for these days? Forty a pound.
#unknown Forty thousand dollars? Hey, you said raise the prices.
#unknown All right, that's 40 times 42 minus distribution charges.
#unknown What? What? Six hundred seventytwo thousand dollars.
#unknown All in? No.
#unknown Each.
#unknown Each? Each.
#unknown Six hundred and? Seventytwo thousand dollars each.
#unknown Each.
#unknown Yes! Hell, yeah! Hey, come high, baby.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Yes! Yes! Well, there goes the generator.
#unknown I think that's it for the gas.
#unknown Perfect timing, yo.
#unknown How do you figure that? What do you mean? We're done cooking.
#unknown I am not done until this barrel is empty.
#unknown Look at this.
#unknown I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons of methylamine.
#unknown Come on, where's your ambition? Jesus.
#unknown Seriously? We are way ahead of schedule, man, all right? Plus the genny needs gas, we're almost out of propane and my back is killing me from that pieceofcrap cot.
#unknown Come on, can we at least just take the night off? Look, I don't have to take you back till Tuesday, right? So we come back tomorrow, strap on the sizzle and glass up the rest.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown There's gotta be a Denny's out there someplace.
#unknown Grand Slam? Hot shower? A bed? Separate rooms.
#unknown Yeah, that's a given.
#unknown What the hell? What the? The battery's dead.
#unknown Jesse, back when I asked you to put the keys in a safe place where did you put them? I left them right here in the ignition.
#unknown Son of a bitch.
#unknown Whoa, whoa, no, this is not my fault, all right? The buzzer didn't buzz.
#unknown The what? The buzzer that buzzes when you put the keys in to let you know the battery's on.
#unknown I know that.
#unknown It didn't buzz.
#unknown Look, I didn't turn the key or anything, all right? I'm not stupid.
#unknown Did you hear the buzzer buzz? I did not.
#unknown It's faulty.
#unknown It's a faulty mechanism.
#unknown Is this just a genetic thing with you? Is it congenital? Did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby? The buzzer did not buzz.
#unknown And you're the one that made me move the keys.
#unknown Yes, I see your point.
#unknown Your imbecility being what it is, I should've known to say: "Jesse, don't leave the keys in the ignition the entire two days.
#unknown " I wanted to leave them on the counter, bitch.
#unknown Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Okay, just.
#unknown All right, so we need to jump the battery somehow.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown How? You gonna be okay? Oh, damn it.
#unknown What's it taste like? Bad, huh? This is good.
#unknown This is good.
#unknown Right here.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown There.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Red to red, black to black.
#unknown Positive, negative.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Start it up.
#unknown What the hell's wrong with this thing? You have to really pull.
#unknown I am.
#unknown No, really pull, not like a girl.
#unknown You know what? Pull this.
#unknown I am pulling.
#unknown It just needs to warm up a little.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Oh, jeez.
#unknown Well done, Jesse, as always.
#unknown Just.
#unknown Well done.
#unknown God.
#unknown Come on, you bitches.
#unknown Hear me now.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown Stupid.
#unknown Okay, now we have to use your phone.
#unknown This is ruined.
#unknown Do you understand? Just ruined.
#unknown You hooked it up wrong and blew it up.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown That is not what happened.
#unknown How do you know? What I know is that I wasn't the one who dumped out the last of our water.
#unknown That's what I know.
#unknown There was a fire.
#unknown Excuse me for thinking on my feet.
#unknown Is that what you were? You were thinking? Now that we have identified the problem You and thinking, that's the problem.
#unknown Look, somebody is going to have to pick us up, all right? Your wife is not gonna notice one little call.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, come on.
#unknown God.
#unknown All right, look, just make it snappy.
#unknown Roaming drains the battery.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Yo, Skinny, hey.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Listen, man, I need you to come pick us up.
#unknown Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
#unknown You got a pen for directions? Look, pencil's fine, retard.
#unknown Just something to write with.
#unknown It doesn't matter.
#unknown All right, so you ready? All right, so you're gonna head west on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles? And you're gonna go past the casino with the big arrows in the parking lot.
#unknown All right No, big arrows, giant arrows.
#unknown They light up and blink.
#unknown You can't miss them.
#unknown Then you're gonna wanna take it slow, because there's this dirt road.
#unknown It's right before the white sign with a 3 on it, okay? Now you're gonna be way, way out in the boonies, okay? Like crazy far, so just keep heading down that dirt road for like what? About another 15 miles.
#unknown Really? That far? Yeah.
#unknown Hurry up.
#unknown The battery.
#unknown All right, just go down that road for like 15 more miles, all right? I mean, we're way the hell out here.
#unknown All right? Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
#unknown Bring water.
#unknown Leave now.
#unknown Here.
#unknown He's coming.
#unknown There was this guy on the Discovery Channel who broke his leg mountain biking and he had to drink urine for.
#unknown You know, just until the forest ranger found him.
#unknown He said it tasted like really hot, really old soda.
#unknown Look, we should just call, you know? I'll be quick, just be like, "Yo, where are you?" All right.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown Yo, where are you? Oh, so you saw the white sign? Yes, he's almost here.
#unknown Oh, man.
#unknown We're getting really freaked out.
#unknown All right, so you're on the dirt road? He's on the dirt road.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown You just crossed the river? Yeah.
#unknown Have you seen anything? Wait, wait.
#unknown What river? Yeah, hey, yo, what river? What the hell river you talking about? There's no river.
#unknown Hey, yo, Pete.
#unknown Yo, Pete, can you? Phone's dead.
#unknown Now what? Mr.
#unknown White, what now? Oh, come on.
#unknown Seriously? What's this? I'm trying to tricklecharge the battery.
#unknown Seriously? Just by turning that thing? The commutator.
#unknown It's the part which generates the electricity.
#unknown Usually this little piston engine turns it but considering that it's lying here completely totalled.
#unknown Anyway.
#unknown Apply a little elbow grease.
#unknown It'll take longer, a lot longer but theoretically it should work.
#unknown Theoretically.
#unknown It has to work.
#unknown You understand? Can I try? Yeah.
#unknown How much longer? I don't know.
#unknown Now? Hey.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Yeah? Yo, man, you hanging in? Yeah, I'm good.
#unknown It's gotta be ready by now, right? No, give it a little longer just to make sure we're Methylamine doesn't spoil does it? No.
#unknown That's not why we're here.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown Lie much? Here, push.
#unknown Okay, okay, okay.
#unknown Now.
#unknown Go on.
#unknown Please, please, please.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown No, please, God.
#unknown No.
#unknown God.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Why couldn't I have just gone to Santa Fe? Why? Why? Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White! What are you doing? Mr.
#unknown White? Oh, God.
#unknown I have this coming.
#unknown What? I have it coming.
#unknown I deserve this.
#unknown Hey, snap out of it.
#unknown All right, first off, everything you did, you did for your family.
#unknown Right? All I ever managed to do was worry and disappoint them and lie.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown All the lies.
#unknown I can't even.
#unknown I can't even keep them straight in my head anymore.
#unknown You know what? Screw this.
#unknown I'm walking.
#unknown You can come or not.
#unknown Where's my other shoe? Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Your body is running dangerously low on electrolytes.
#unknown Sodium, potassium, calcium.
#unknown And when they're gone your brain ceases to communicate with your muscles.
#unknown Your lungs stop breathing, your heart stops pumping.
#unknown You go marching out there and within an hour, you will be dead.
#unknown Okay, you need to cut out all your loser crybaby crap right now and think of something scientific.
#unknown Something Something scientific, right.
#unknown What? Come on, man.
#unknown You're smart, all right? You made poison out of beans, yo.
#unknown All right, look.
#unknown We got We got an entire lab right here, all right? How about you take some of these chemicals and mix up some rocket fuel? And we can just send up a signal flare.
#unknown Or you make some kind of robot to get us help or a homing device or build a new battery or.
#unknown Or wait, no.
#unknown What if we just take some stuff off of the RV and build it into something completely different? You know, like a.
#unknown Like a dune buggy.
#unknown And that way, we can just dunebuggy or.
#unknown What? Hey.
#unknown What is it? What? Do you have any money? Change, I mean.
#unknown Coins.
#unknown Yeah, I got a bunch from the Okay.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Gather them.
#unknown And washers and nuts and bolts and screws and whatever little pieces of metal we can think of that is galvanized.
#unknown It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.
#unknown Solid zinc, okay.
#unknown And And bring me Bring me brake pads.
#unknown The front wheels should have discs.
#unknown Take them off and bring them to me.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Brake pads, okay.
#unknown Brake pads.
#unknown What are we building? You said it yourself.
#unknown A robot? A battery.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Move! This doesn't look like any battery I ever saw.
#unknown Well, trust me, it is a battery.
#unknown Or rather, one cell of a battery.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Cut up the last two sponges.
#unknown Remember the electrolytes? Well, think about it.
#unknown A battery is a galvanic cell.
#unknown It's no more than an anode and a cathode separated by an electrolyte, right? Right.
#unknown Yeah, well, anyway.
#unknown Here.
#unknown On one side, you have mercuric oxide and graphite from your brake pads.
#unknown This is the cathode.
#unknown This is the positive terminal.
#unknown This is where the supply of current flows out from, you see? Then.
#unknown Here, I'll show you.
#unknown On the opposite side is our anode.
#unknown This.
#unknown It's zinc.
#unknown It's what we find in our coins and anything galvanized.
#unknown So the sponge is the electrolyte? Yeah.
#unknown Well, no, the potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte.
#unknown But, yes, that's what I'm soaking the sponges in.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown And now, what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with? What one particular element comes to mind? Wire.
#unknown Copper.
#unknown Oh, I mean Copper.
#unknown Right.
#unknown The only question now is will this supply enough current? And how many cells will we need? We've only got material enough for six.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Put the lid on.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Positive.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Cathode.
#unknown Anode.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown That is good.
#unknown That is very good.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Attention, passengers: Please maintain visual contact with your personal belongings at all times.
#unknown Any bags left unattended will be confiscated by.
#unknown How's the? It's fine.
#unknown I know I can trust you to.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Hey, whatever happens your family will get your share.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown So I'll be hearing from you, yeah? Yeah.
#unknown How's everyone doing? Is that baby ever gonna come out, you think? I know.
#unknown I know, enough already.
#unknown It's I'm teasing.
#unknown Everything in its time.
#unknown Walt, I have your scan results.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You're showing signs of remission.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown I wanna clarify.
#unknown There are misconceptions about what remission signifies.
#unknown It does not mean that the patient is cured.
#unknown To classify someone as in remission we only need to determine that the tumour hasn't grown.
#unknown That it hasn't grown? Jesus.
#unknown Technically speaking a tumour can remain the exact same size it was before and the patient could still be in remission.
#unknown Now, in Walt's case, with a stage III adenocarcinoma I'd like to see, I hope to see at least a 25 to 35percent reduction in tumour mass something to tell me that the cancer has responded to the therapy.
#unknown Everybody still with me? And how has my cancer responded? Walt, your tumour has shrunk by 80 percent.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Wait, wait, wait.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Wait, I'm really.
#unknown I'm confused.
#unknown Is? Isn't 80 percent a lot? Mom, yeah.
#unknown Yes, 80 percent is a lot.
#unknown Okay, but, I'm Wait Sweetheart, you were right.
#unknown It's very good news.
#unknown It's very good news.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown My God, are you kidding me? Just when I try to get out, they pull me back in.
#unknown That's great.
#unknown Now, that cough is the other thing we need to discuss.
#unknown According to your scan, Walt, you have radiation pneumonitis.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown This is fairly common.
#unknown See that scarylooking thing there? That's tissue inflammation.
#unknown It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.
#unknown It's usually not serious, but it can produce a cough like that.
#unknown I'll prescribe some prednisone.
#unknown Tissue inflammation? I.
#unknown Are you sure about that? I mean, I Because the other day, I was coughing up some blood.
#unknown What? You probably have a tear in your oesophagus from coughing.
#unknown That can be serious.
#unknown You could rupture and bleed to death.
#unknown This is something we're gonna have to deal with before you leave today.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown When did this happen? Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry, I just No more secrets, Walt.
#unknown With something like this, you have to call me immediately.
#unknown Now, with these results, we're not completely out of the woods.
#unknown But now at least we have some options the most important of which is time.
#unknown We'll have more to discuss in the next few weeks.
#unknown But for now, I'd say that you folks have earned some celebrating.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown
