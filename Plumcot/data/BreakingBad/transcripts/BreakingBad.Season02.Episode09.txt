marie_schrader  Some places skimp and they only do the PET.
marie_schrader  I'm not naming any names.
marie_schrader  just still don't understand why you don't go to Kleinman.
skyler_white  This is where WaIt's doctor is.
marie_schrader  Well, with us, you wouldn't have to wait until next week to get the results.
marie_schrader  I'm sorry, but these scans are not that difficult to read.
marie_schrader  I could take one look at WaIt's and tell you immediately how he's doing. Really.
skyler_white  Doctors
marie_schrader  Doctors like people to think that they're so much smarter than the technicians but you would be surprised how much they come to us for input.

jesse_pinkman  Perfect timing, yo.
walter_white  do you figure that? What
jesse_pinkman  you mean?
jesse_pinkman  We're done cooking.
walter_white  I am not done until this barrel is empty.
walter_white  Look at
walter_white  I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons of methylamine.
walter_white  Come on, where's your ambition? Jesus
jesse_pinkman  Jesus. Seriously
jesse_pinkman  Seriously?
jesse_pinkman  We are way ahead of schedule, man, all right
jesse_pinkman  right? Plus the genny needs gas, we're almost out of propane and my back is killing me from that pieceofcrap cot.

jesse_pinkman  whoa, no, this is not my fault, all right?
jesse_pinkman  The buzzer didn't buzz.
walter_white  The what?
jesse_pinkman  The buzzer that buzzes when you put the keys in to let you know the battery's on.
jesse_pinkman  I know that.
jesse_pinkman  It didn't buzz.
jesse_pinkman  Look, I didn't turn the key or anything, all right?
jesse_pinkman  I'm not stupid.
jesse_pinkman  Did you hear the buzzer buzz?
jesse_pinkman  I did not.
jesse_pinkman  It's faulty.
jesse_pinkman  It's a faulty mechanism.
walter_white  Is this just a genetic thing with you?
walter_white  Is it congenital?
walter_white  Did your mother drop you on your head when you were a baby?
jesse_pinkman  The buzzer did not buzz. And
jesse_pinkman  And you're the one that made me move the keys. Yes,
walter_white  I see your point.
walter_white  Your imbecility being what it is, I should've known to say :
walter_white  :" Jesse, don't leave the keys in the ignition the entire two days."
jesse_pinkman  I wanted to leave them on the counter, bitch.
jesse_pinkman  I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.
jesse_pinkman  Okay,
walter_white  just.
walter_white  All right, so we need to jump the battery somehow.
jesse_pinkman  Okay.
jesse_pinkman  You gonna be okay?
walter_white  damn it
jesse_pinkman  What's it taste like
jesse_pinkman  Bad, huh?
walter_white  This is good. This

walter_white  No, no, no. That
walter_white  That is not what happened.
jesse_pinkman  How do you know?
walter_white  What I know is that I wasn't the one who dumped out the last of our water.
walter_white  That's what I know.
jesse_pinkman  There was a fire.
jesse_pinkman  Excuse me for thinking on my feet.
walter_white  Is that what you were?

jesse_pinkman  They light up and blink.
jesse_pinkman  You can't miss them.
jesse_pinkman  Then you're gonna wanna take it slow, because there's this dirt road.

jesse_pinkman  Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.

jesse_pinkman  What's this?
walter_white  trying to
jesse_pinkman  the battery.
jesse_pinkman  by turning that thing?
walter_white  The commutator
walter_white  part which generates the electricity.
walter_white  Usually this little piston engine turns it but considering that it's lying here completely totalled.
walter_white  a little elbow grease.
walter_white  take longer, a lot longer but theoretically it should work.
jesse_pinkman  Theoretically.
walter_white  It has to work.
walter_white  You understand?
jesse_pinkman  Can I try?
jesse_pinkman  How much
jesse_pinkman  much longer? I don't know. Now? Hey. Mr. White.
jesse_pinkman  man, you hanging in? Yeah, I'm good. It's gotta be ready by now,

walter_white  I deserve this.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, snap out of it.
jesse_pinkman  right, first off, everything you did, you did for your family.
jesse_pinkman  Right?
walter_white  All I ever managed to do was worry and disappoint them and lie.
walter_white  Oh, God. All the lies. I can't even. I can't even keep them straight in my head anymore.
jesse_pinkman  what?
jesse_pinkman  this.
jesse_pinkman  walking.
jesse_pinkman  You can come or not.
jesse_pinkman  other shoe? Jesse. Jesse. Your
walter_white  Your body
walter_white  body is running dangerously low on electrolytes.
walter_white  Sodium, potassium, calcium.
walter_white  And when they're gone your brain ceases to communicate with your muscles.
walter_white  Your lungs stop breathing, your heart stops pumping.
walter_white  You go marching out there and within an hour, you will be dead.
jesse_pinkman  Okay, you need to cut out all your loser crybaby crap right now and think of something scientific.
walter_white  Something Something scientific, right.
jesse_pinkman  What? Come
jesse_pinkman  Come on, man. You're
jesse_pinkman  You're smart, all right? You
jesse_pinkman  You made poison out of beans, yo.
jesse_pinkman  right, look.
jesse_pinkman  We got
jesse_pinkman  We got an entire lab right here, all right?
jesse_pinkman  How about you take some of these chemicals and mix up some rocket fuel? And
jesse_pinkman  we can just send up a signal flare.
jesse_pinkman  Or you make some kind of robot to get us help or a homing device or build a new battery or. Or wait
jesse_pinkman  What
jesse_pinkman  we just take some stuff off of the RV and build it into something completely different?
jesse_pinkman  like a. Like a dune buggy.
jesse_pinkman  And that way, we can just dunebuggy or. What? Hey.
jesse_pinkman  What is it?
jesse_pinkman  What?
walter_white  Do you have any money?
walter_white  Change, I mean.
walter_white  Coins.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, I got
walter_white  got a bunch from
jesse_pinkman  Yes.
walter_white  Gather them.
walter_white  And washers and nuts and bolts and screws and whatever little pieces of metal we can think of that is galvanized.
walter_white  It has to be galvanized or solid zinc. Solid zinc,
jesse_pinkman  And
walter_white  And And bring me
walter_white  Bring me brake pads.
walter_white  The front wheels should have discs.
walter_white  Take them off and bring them to me.
jesse_pinkman  Okay.
jesse_pinkman  What are we building?
walter_white  You said it yourself.
jesse_pinkman  A robot
walter_white  A battery.
jesse_pinkman  This doesn't look like any battery I ever saw.
walter_white  trust me, it is a battery.
walter_white  rather, one cell of a battery.
walter_white  up the last two sponges.
walter_white  Remember the electrolytes?
walter_white  Well, think about it.
walter_white  A battery is a galvanic cell.
walter_white  no more than an anode and a cathode separated by an electrolyte, right?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah
walter_white  Yeah, well, anyway.
walter_white  Here.
walter_white  On one side, you have mercuric oxide and graphite from your brake pads.
walter_white  This is the cathode. This
walter_white  This is the positive terminal.
walter_white  This is where the supply of current flows out from, you see? Then.
walter_white  Here, I'll show
walter_white  On the
walter_white  the opposite side is our anode.
walter_white  This.
walter_white  It's zinc.
walter_white  what we find in our coins and anything galvanized.
jesse_pinkman  So the sponge is the electrolyte?
walter_white  Well
walter_white  Well, no, the potassium hydroxide is the electrolyte.
walter_white  But, yes, that's what I'm soaking the sponges in.
walter_white  Good.
walter_white  Good.
walter_white  And now, what shall we use to conduct this beautiful current with?
walter_white  What one particular element comes to mind?
jesse_pinkman  Wire. Copper. Oh, I mean
walter_white  Copper.
walter_white  The only question now is will this supply enough current?
walter_white  And how many cells will we need?
walter_white  We've only got material enough for six.
walter_white  Okay. Put the lid on.
walter_white  Wait.
walter_white  Positive.
walter_white  Cathode.
walter_white  Damn
walter_white  That is good.
walter_white  is very good.
walter_white  Okay. Here
walter_white  Come on. Attention, passengers : Please maintain visual contact with
jesse_pinkman  times. Any bags left unattended will be confiscated by. How's the?
walter_white  It's
walter_white  I know I can trust you to.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, whatever happens your family will get your share.
jesse_pinkman  So I'll be hearing from you, yeah? Yeah.
dr._delcavoli  How's everyone doing?
dr._delcavoli  that baby ever gonna come out, you think?
skyler_white  I know.

skyler_white  It's I'm
dr._delcavoli  I'm teasing.
dr._delcavoli  Everything in its
dr._delcavoli  Walt, I have your scan results.
dr._delcavoli  Yeah. You're showing signs of remission.
marie_schrader  I
dr._delcavoli  I wanna clarify.
dr._delcavoli  There are misconceptions about what remission signifies.
dr._delcavoli  It does not mean that the patient is cured.
dr._delcavoli  To classify someone as in remission we only need to determine that the tumour hasn't grown.
hank_schrader  That it hasn't grown?
hank_schrader  Jesus.
dr._delcavoli  Technically speaking a tumour can remain the exact same size it was before and the patient could still be in remission.
dr._delcavoli  Now, in Walt's case, with a stage III adenocarcinoma I'd like to see, I hope to see at least a 25 to 35percent reduction in tumour mass something to tell me that the cancer has responded to the therapy.
dr._delcavoli  Everybody still with me?
walter_white  And how has my cancer responded?
dr._delcavoli  Walt, your tumour has shrunk by 80 percent.
marie_schrader  Oh, my God.
skyler_white  Wait, wait, wait.
skyler_white  I'm sorry.
skyler_white  Wait, I'm really.
skyler_white  I'm confused.
skyler_white  Is?
skyler_white  Isn't 80 percent a lot?
walter_white_jr.  Mom, yeah. Yes
dr._delcavoli  Yes, 80 percent is a lot.
skyler_white  Okay, but, I'm Wait Sweetheart
walter_white  Sweetheart, you were right.
walter_white  It's very good news.
dr._delcavoli  It's very good news.
marie_schrader  Oh, my God. My God,
hank_schrader  are you kidding me
hank_schrader  when I try to get out, they pull me back in. That's great.
dr._delcavoli  Now, that cough is the other thing we need to discuss.
dr._delcavoli  According to your scan, Walt, you have radiation pneumonitis. It's
dr._delcavoli  It's okay.
dr._delcavoli  This is fairly common.
dr._delcavoli  See that scarylooking thing there?
dr._delcavoli  That's tissue inflammation.
dr._delcavoli  It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.
dr._delcavoli  It's usually not serious, but it can produce a cough like that.
dr._delcavoli  I'll prescribe some prednisone.
walter_white  Tissue inflammation?
walter_white  I.
walter_white  Are you sure about that? I
walter_white  I mean, I
walter_white  Because the other day, I was coughing up some blood.
skyler_white  You
dr._delcavoli  You probably have a tear in your oesophagus from coughing.
dr._delcavoli  That can be serious.
dr._delcavoli  You could rupture and bleed to death.
dr._delcavoli  This is something we're gonna have to deal with before you leave today.
skyler_white  a minute. When did this happen?
skyler_white  Why didn't you tell me?
walter_white  I'm sorry, I just No
dr._delcavoli  No more secrets, Walt.
dr._delcavoli  With something like this, you have to call me immediately.
dr._delcavoli  Now, with these results, we're not completely out of the woods.
dr._delcavoli  But now at least we have some options the most important of which is time.
dr._delcavoli  We'll have more to discuss in the next few weeks.
dr._delcavoli  But for now, I'd say that you folks have earned some celebrating.
walter_white_jr.  Yes.
