barry  because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
barry  It just really gets inside your brain,
barry  In college they have this thing where, if your roommate kills himself like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever it's basically, like, an automatic" A" for you.
barry  And I just think that that kind of compassion is

walter_white  H. C.
walter_white  Sorry.
walter_white  I um I was just moved.

carmen_molina  by the way, welcome back.
walter_white  It's so good to have you back. mutters Uh I guess what I I would Sorry
walter_white  Sorry.
walter_white  I guess what I would want to say is to look on the bright side.
walter_white  First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
walter_white  And that I mean, an incident like this over a populated urban center
walter_white  That right there, that's that's just gotta be some minor miracle
walter_white  Plus, neither plane was full.
walter_white  You know, the the 737 was was what? Uh, maybe twothirds full, I believe. Right
walter_white  Right? Yes?
walter_white  Or maybe even threequarters full.
walter_white  Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualtywise is just the 50th worst air disaster.
walter_white  Actually, tied for 50th.
walter_white  There are, in truth, that are just as bad or worse
walter_white  Tenerife?
walter_white  Has anybody anybody
walter_white  anybody hear of Tenerife?

walter_white  I mean, it's way bigger than a 737. And we're talking about two of them.
walter_white  Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
walter_white  Doesn't any of you even remember it at all?
walter_white  Any of you?
walter_white  I doubt it.
walter_white  You know why?
walter_white  because people move on.
walter_white  They just move on.

marie_schrader  he's probably just wondering, you know, what is it that could have gone so wrong Marie
skyler_white  Marie. that
marie_schrader  that my mother would leave Marie
skyler_white  Marie.
marie_schrader  I can't help you get through this, Skyler, you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did.

group_leader  I was high on cocaine, and I was drunk.
group_leader  Cocaine wasn't an issue because
group_leader  because I had bought myself 2 grams the night before as a birthday present.
group_leader  I had plenty left.
group_leader  But I was out of vodka.
group_leader  And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia, where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets, they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p. m. And right then it was, like, 4:42. So

jesse_pinkman  How do you not hate yourself?
group_leader  I did hate myself for a long time
group_leader  But it didn't stop me from drinking and getting high.
group_leader  It just made it that much worse.
