#unknown [receiver clatters] [exhales] [cell phone buzzes] [buzz] [buzz] [school bell rings] [Woman on P.
#unknown A.
#unknown ] May I have your attention, please? As all of you know, last week our city suffered a terrible tragedy, one that none of us will ever forget, which is why today we're going to take a little time out of our schedule to gather in the gym and talk.
#unknown I just find it, you know, really really hard to concentrate because of all the horrors, you know, we perceived.
#unknown It just really gets inside your brain, and In college they have this thing where, if your roommate kills himself like, if you come home and find him hanging in the closet or whatever it's basically, like, an automatic "A" for you.
#unknown And I just think that that kind of compassion is is something to Okay.
#unknown Thank you, Barry.
#unknown Who wants to go next? Hmm? No judgments, guys.
#unknown Just feelings.
#unknown You can say anything and everything that's on your mind.
#unknown Anyone? There you go, honey.
#unknown I just keep asking myself Honey, could you please stand up? Just keep asking myself, "Why did this happen?" I mean, if there's a God and all, why does he allow all those innocent people to die for no reason? Okay, can we just keep it secular, honey? Anyhow, I haven't really been sleeping much.
#unknown Does anyone else have that? I just keep hearing that that sound.
#unknown That boom.
#unknown It just plays over and over in my head like it won't ever stop.
#unknown [Woman] Thank you, sweetheart.
#unknown Is there anyone else? Uh [clears throat] My neighbor, he heard the crash, and he ran out to his front yard, and he found, like, this seat you know, like, an airline seat.
#unknown Like one you have on an airliner? Well, anyway, the seat was standing perfectly upright in his front yard, right next to his SeaDoos because, like, he has SeaDoos But there was still a pair of legs buckled into them.
#unknown Human legs.
#unknown J H.
#unknown C.
#unknown [whispers] You okay? Yeah.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown I um I was just moved.
#unknown [Woman] Maybe we should hear from the faculty.
#unknown Certainly this tragedy didn't only affect our students.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, would you like to say something? And by the way, welcome back.
#unknown Hmm? [applause] It's so good to have you back.
#unknown [mutters] Uh I guess what I I would Sorry.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown I guess what I would want to say is to look on the bright side.
#unknown First of all, nobody on the ground was killed.
#unknown And that I mean, an incident like this over a populated urban center That right there, that's that's just gotta be some minor miracle, so Plus, neither plane was full.
#unknown You know, the the 737 was was what? Uh, maybe twothirds full, I believe.
#unknown Right? Yes? Or maybe even threequarters full.
#unknown Well, at any rate, what you're left with casualtywise is just the 50th worst air disaster.
#unknown Actually, tied for 50th.
#unknown There are, in truth, that are just as bad or worse Tenerife? Has anybody anybody hear of Tenerife? No? In 1977, two fully loaded 747s crashed into each other on Tenerife.
#unknown Does anybody know how big a 747 is? I mean, it's way bigger than a 737.
#unknown And we're talking about two of them.
#unknown Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.
#unknown Doesn't any of you even remember it at all? Any of you? I doubt it.
#unknown You know why? It's because people move on.
#unknown They just move on.
#unknown And we will, too.
#unknown We will move on, and we will get past this because that is what human beings do.
#unknown We survive.
#unknown And, uh We survive, and and we we overcome.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown We survive.
#unknown We survive, and Thank you.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown [feedback] Good.
#unknown Well Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing? Fine, I guess.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown You make sure you say hello to her for me, will you? Why don't you just come inside? It's your house.
#unknown No, I [door closes] [engine starts] He's gone.
#unknown [Marie] Hey, Flynn! Tricks.
#unknown It's an expression.
#unknown How are you? Why do you gotta treat him like this? Why you gotta be like this? Why can't you just talk, even? Hey, hey, hey.
#unknown Cool down.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Out of the mouths of babes, huh? [door slams] [whispers] Wow.
#unknown You know, try not to hold it against him.
#unknown You know, I mean, the poor kid, he's probably just dying of curiosity.
#unknown You know, and I guess it would be natural for him to wonder.
#unknown I mean, he's probably just wondering, you know, what is it that could have gone so wrong Marie.
#unknown that my mother would leave Marie.
#unknown I can't help you get through this, Skyler, you know, if you won't tell me what it is that Walt did.
#unknown Well, you know what? I don't I don't remember asking you, all right? Well, I think that's So if you want to be supportive, the reason you're stuck.
#unknown you could be supportive without prying, that would be really great Prying, okay.
#unknown and so Well, prying's a strong word, but I don't helpful.
#unknown [Man] It's that voice inside your head.
#unknown It's that sneaky, ratbastard, 24/7 voice.
#unknown You guys know what I'm talking about.
#unknown That voice that tells you you're not good enough.
#unknown Not good enough for what? Not good enough to be what, President of the United States? Well, okay, so maybe you're not that good.
#unknown But now are you good enough to deserve your share of basic human happiness? Are you good enough to be okay with who and what you are? I say yes.
#unknown But it doesn't matter what I say.
#unknown It's your voice, which means you're the only one that hears it, which means that you're the only one that can fight it.
#unknown Right? Jesse we never hear from you.
#unknown What's going on? You can tell me I'm full of s.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown I don't mind.
#unknown Just Come on.
#unknown Let us in on it.
#unknown So, like, what makes you the expert? I don't think I ever said I was that.
#unknown Yeah, but you're the one sitting here, right? Telling us thus and so, be happy, forgive yourself, blah, blah, blah.
#unknown Have you ever really hurt anybody? I don't just mean disappointed your mother or whatever, but did you ever really hurt someone? I killed my daughter.
#unknown It was July 18 which is my birthday.
#unknown July 18, 1992.
#unknown I was high on cocaine, and I was drunk.
#unknown Cocaine wasn't an issue because I had bought myself 2 grams the night before as a birthday present.
#unknown I had plenty left.
#unknown But I was out of vodka.
#unknown And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia, where instead of selling liquor in the supermarkets, they have these ABC stores which close at 5 p.
#unknown m.
#unknown And right then it was, like, 4:42.
#unknown So I'm arguing with my wife "Come on, go to the ABC for me.
#unknown "It's my birthday.
#unknown "Come on.
#unknown They're not gonna sell it to me.
#unknown " She's saying, "No, no.
#unknown " So I'm ped, and the clock is ticking, so I jump in my truck.
#unknown She's my 6yearold daughter She's playing at the end of the driveway.
#unknown So How do you not hate yourself? I did hate myself for a long time.
#unknown But it didn't stop me from drinking and getting high.
#unknown It just made it that much worse.
#unknown Selfhatred, guilt, it accomplishes nothing.
#unknown It just stands in the way.
#unknown Stands in the way of what? True change.
#unknown [knocking on door] [coughs] Skyler, hi.
#unknown Is this a good time to talk? Yeah.
#unknown Come in, please.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Um Do you want to start? Okay.
#unknown Why Why are you doing this? Why are you even thinking this way? Is it to punish me? I am not punishing you, Walt.
#unknown This is punitive is what this is.
#unknown We are happily married.
#unknown [exhales] I am happily married.
#unknown I am happy.
#unknown We're just I love you, Skyler, and I would do anything for you.
#unknown Would you even consider I mean, J! You come in here, and you wave these papers in my face, when there's a whole other entire side to this thing.
#unknown There's your side, and there's my side.
#unknown And you haven't heard my side yet.
#unknown You haven't heard any of it at all.
#unknown You're a drug dealer.
#unknown No.
#unknown What How What? [inhales, exhales] Yeah.
#unknown How else could you possibly make that kind of money? Marijuana.
#unknown That Pinkman kid.
#unknown No? Oh, my God, Walt.
#unknown Cocaine? It's methamphetamine.
#unknown But I I'm I manufacture.
#unknown I am not a dealer.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Per se.
#unknown It doesn't [gasps] No, Skyler.
#unknown Listen to me, Skyler.
#unknown No.
#unknown Listen.
#unknown No.
#unknown There are a lot of angles to this, okay? It's complicated, all right? So please, let's Please, let's just sit back down, and we'll talk it through.
#unknown I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.
#unknown I won't tell Hank, and I won't tell your children or anybody else.
#unknown Nobody will hear it from me, but only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives.
#unknown No, Skyler.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown Now let me the h out of here before I throw up.
#unknown Your windshield's broken.
#unknown Yep.
#unknown A little friction in the marriage right now.
#unknown Strictly temporary.
#unknown We're just just taking a little break.
#unknown Uh, that's you over there.
#unknown Listen, um, money.
#unknown Saul has got it for you, and so as so as you're feeling better I'm better.
#unknown You're better.
#unknown Really? What? The rehab? It helped? Yeah.
#unknown I'm done using.
#unknown That's excellent.
#unknown That's That's very good, Jesse.
#unknown Boy Very good.
#unknown You know, um in spite of how bad things got, it really could be looked at like a wakeup call for th of us.
#unknown I mean, you know, just to get our our lives back together again and on the straight and narrow.
#unknown You been following this airplane crash? Yeah.
#unknown You know it was Jane's dad who accidentally crashed them together? Because he was so torn up? Okay, look, let me stop you right there, all right? You are not responsible for this not in any way, shape, or form, all right? Now, I I am very uptodate on this thing, probably far more than you are, and there are there are many factors at play there.
#unknown Yeah? For instance, there's some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working properly.
#unknown Now, that's public record.
#unknown You can look that up.
#unknown And the whole system is run on on 1960s technology.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, really I blame the government.
#unknown You either run from things, or you face them, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown And what exactly does that mean? I learned it in rehab.
#unknown It's all about accepting who you really are.
#unknown I accept who I am.
#unknown And who are you? I'm the bad guy.
#unknown Is the food to your satisfaction? Very much.
#unknown It's good to see you again.
#unknown May I? I have an offer that I think will be of interest to you.
#unknown I actually am not here to I'm here because I owe you the courtesy and respect to tell you this personally.

#unknown It has nothing to do with you personally.
#unknown I find you extraordinarily professional, and I appreciate the way you do business.
#unknown I'm just making a change in my life is what it is, and I'm I'm at some something of a crossroads.
#unknown It has brought me to a realization.
#unknown I am not a criminal.
