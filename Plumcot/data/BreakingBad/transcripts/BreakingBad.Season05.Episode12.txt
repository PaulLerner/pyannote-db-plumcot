#unknown The ricin cigarette! And all for Mr.
#unknown White!? He poisoned Brock and you helped him! Jesse!? Jesse! You show yourself right now! I'll be in touch.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hey, Huell.
#unknown Listen, I want you to swing by the high school on your way to Saul's.
#unknown I can't believe that he would go after my son, but You got it.
#unknown And Kuby's at the car wash, right? Parked right across the street.
#unknown All's quiet.
#unknown No Pinkman.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Just find him.
#unknown Please leave your message.
#unknown Jesse, listen, uh, I mean, obviously you've changed your mind here, and so thank you for that.
#unknown And I know you're angry.
#unknown I wanna fix this, okay? Whatever it takes, all right? We'll talk, and we will fix this.
#unknown Until then, just just sleep it off, okay? And then call me.
#unknown Be safe.
#unknown How's it coming? I replaced the doorjamb and the striker plate.
#unknown Switch this out, we'll be good to go.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Oh, hey, uh, do you want separate keys for the different locks, or do you want just one working both? No, no, no.
#unknown No rekey.
#unknown Same exact keys as before.
#unknown Okay, it's just that usually with a breakin, people like to get new keys.
#unknown No, same key, same locks.
#unknown The old keys have to work here, okay?  Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Good, good, good, good.
#unknown Oh, no, no.
#unknown Um, hey, guys, guys, guys.
#unknown Cut that.
#unknown Yeah, this, uh That area's still pretty bad.
#unknown Right, right.
#unknown We'll have to go over this a lot more.
#unknown Well, we've made three passes already.
#unknown Like I say, gasoline's tricky.
#unknown No, no, no, no.
#unknown No, no, no, no, no.
#unknown The smell has got to be gone completely.
#unknown My wife is coming home, and I can't have any odor, any stain, any sign that anything happened here.
#unknown Understand? I I know.
#unknown This is short notice, and I really appreciate it.
#unknown Sir sir, we'd love to take more of your money, but you've got gas soaked straight through to your subfloor.
#unknown Until you pull this up and get new carpet, new padding, this is as good as it gets.
#unknown Is that gasoline? Ask dad.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Over here.
#unknown What happened? What happened is that I should sue someone.
#unknown That's what happened.
#unknown So I'm on my way to the drugstore, and I have to stop to get some gas, and there is this total pump malfunction.
#unknown You know what? She really shouldn't be in this room at all.
#unknown I mean, this is supposedly green, but you know how it is.
#unknown You can close the windows in the nursery, because it's really only out here.
#unknown Ugh.
#unknown This is as good as it gets.
#unknown So, um, pump malfunction? Yeah.
#unknown So I'm standing there filling up like I've done a thousand times before, and I hear a chunk.
#unknown You know, the pump's nozzle.
#unknown The the metal thing.
#unknown The thing you squeeze, right? I hear a chunk.
#unknown So I suppose, in my naivete, I took to understand that gas is no longer coming out of the nozzle, so I pull out the hose to put it back and whoosh! You know, I am suddenly soaked in gasoline.
#unknown I mean, on my arms and my legs and my my groin.
#unknown So now I am in a panic, and I race home, I run inside the house, and I'm stripping off my clothes as fast as I can.
#unknown I jump in the shower.
#unknown It's not until after I get out of the shower that I realize my gascovered clothes have been soaking in the living room rug this entire time.
#unknown I mean, it's it's the whole thing is just so stupid.
#unknown I could have rinsed off at the station.
#unknown Halfway home, I'm starting to realize wait a minute there's a water hose right there next to the air pump.
#unknown You know, for tires.
#unknown Anyway, so that was my day.
#unknown How was yours?  Dad?  Yeah.
#unknown Please, can you just tell the truth? Tell What do you mean? You fainted, didn't you? 'Cause you're sick again.
#unknown You were pumping gas, and the fumes, they they made you pass out again.
#unknown Just just admit it.
#unknown No, the no.
#unknown It was the pump.
#unknown All right, I I maybe I did get a little swimmy at one point, but I did not faint.
#unknown Okay? I'm fine, and that's the truth.
#unknown However, in the best interest of all of our continued good health, I don't think we can stay here.
#unknown I mean, not until we get new carpet.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie, they they got plenty of space.
#unknown Hey, what about a hotel? A hotel.
#unknown That could be sweet.
#unknown A a good one.
#unknown I like the way you're thinking.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Could be a little family vacation.
#unknown Might be fun.
#unknown What do you say? Why don't you put some clothes together? Yeah.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown It's not my finest hour.
#unknown I'll go pack a bag.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Think this'll leave a scar? I never should have let my Dojo membership run out.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Jesse did that? Yeah, but you gotta understand, deep down he loves me.
#unknown So where is he?  Still looking.
#unknown Where have you looked? His place, his folk's place, uh, this Brock kid's place.
#unknown Crack shacks at Siesta Hills, the Indigo, the Crystal Palace, gokart joint on Copper Ave.
#unknown Uh, AA meeting off the 40.
#unknown His buddies, Beaver and what'shisname? Uh, Badger and Skinny Pete.
#unknown Yeah, no, he's not with them.
#unknown They could be covering for him.
#unknown I posed as a meter reader.
#unknown I put a bug in the tall kid's mom's place.
#unknown For three hours straight, all he talked about was something called Babylon 5.
#unknown I checked with my gal at APD.
#unknown Uh, she said Pinkman's not in their system, so the cops don't have him.
#unknown Yet.
#unknown Maybe he changed his mind about leaving, called your guy back.
#unknown No.
#unknown Somebody misses their first chance with my guy, there's no second.
#unknown Well, keep looking.
#unknown What then? What do you mean? I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny.
#unknown Sooner or later, he's gonna turn up.
#unknown I'm wondering what you wanna do when he does.
#unknown Jesse is upset about the boy.
#unknown I just need to explain to him why that had to happen.
#unknown Okay, but say, you know, just for the sake of argument, the kid's not in the mood for a nuanced discussion of the virtues of child poisoning.
#unknown You know, his plans are running more towards stabbing you to death with a pointed stick.
#unknown In that scenario, then what? You have a suggestion? We were wondering if maybe this isn't an "Old Yeller" type situation.
#unknown "Old Yeller"? Yeah, Old Yeller was the best, most loyal dog there ever was.
#unknown I mean, everybody loved that mutt, but one day he showed up rabid, and Little Timmy, for Old Yeller's own sake, had to, uh Oh, you you saw the movie.
#unknown You're full of colorful metaphors, aren't you, Saul? Belize, Old Yeller.
#unknown Just brimming with advice.
#unknown Do not float that idea again.
#unknown Find him.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Room key wouldn't let me into the ice room, so I had to go down to the front desk.
#unknown But here we are.
#unknown Checked in on Junior.
#unknown Payperview and room service.
#unknown He's in heaven.
#unknown Hey, I thought you were gonna take a bath.
#unknown How's Saul doing? Saul? Goodman? I have no idea.
#unknown No? You were just out talking to him in the parking lot.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Were you spying on me? Yes.
#unknown And I feel just awful about it too.
#unknown You know, I played along with your pump malfunction bullshit because Junior was standing right there, but now I would like to know what's going on.
#unknown First of all, it's no big deal.
#unknown Coming here is just me being overly cautious.
#unknown Jesse Pinkman, you know? He came over to the house that time for dinner, remember? Well, he he got upset over this something he thinks I did.
#unknown I did do it.
#unknown But I did it for very good reasons.
#unknown It's just it's complicated.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Are you are you telling me that he tried to burn our house down? That was, probably for a brief moment, his intention, but obviously he changed his mind.
#unknown And how does that work? Him him changing his mind? Ah, God.
#unknown Look With You've got to understand.
#unknown With with Jesse, there are emotional issues, personal issues, some drug abuse.
#unknown But he has always been more of a danger to himself than anyone else.
#unknown He has a tendency to fly off the handle.
#unknown That's all.
#unknown So he has never hurt anybody? No.
#unknown I can't believe you got her down so fast.
#unknown Oh So what's your course of action here? Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down, which shouldn't take long, and when he does, I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to him.
#unknown Make him see reason.
#unknown "Talk to him.
#unknown Make him see reason.
#unknown " So I'm clear, these are just euphemisms you're using here, right? No.
#unknown What? Whwhat does that mean? My God.
#unknown I knew this was going to happen.
#unknown I knew it.
#unknown I told you that someday, someone was going to come to our door and try to hurt us.
#unknown And now here we are.
#unknown No.
#unknown Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.
#unknown He poured gasoline all over our house, Walt.
#unknown He tried to set our house on fire.
#unknown He changed his mind.
#unknown He didn't do it, did he? What if he changes it back? Walt, you need to deal with this.
#unknown How much have you had to drink? Not nearly enough.
#unknown I I don't know how we got off on whatever it is we're talking about here.
#unknown But clearly, I haven't explained the situation well enough, because this is a big overreaction.
#unknown We all need to just take a deep breath and calm down, because Jesse isn't just some some some rabid dog.
#unknown This is a person.
#unknown A person that is a threat to us.
#unknown I mean, my God, where we are now with Hank and Marie and that awful tape we made.
#unknown After everything we've done, you can't just talk to this person.
#unknown You're ssaying that I just What what exactly are you saying? We've come this far.
#unknown For us.
#unknown What's one more? Jesse! Stop what you're doing and turn and face me! You wanna you wanna know what he did? You wanna hear about it? Jesse, put out the lighter.
#unknown He poisoned a little kid.
#unknown An eightyearold boy.
#unknown Just because, you know just as a move! Walt's a bastard.
#unknown Secret's out.
#unknown We'll talk about it.
#unknown But I need you to put out the lighter, okay? Look, Jesse Jesse, I don't want to kill you.
#unknown And you don't wanna be killed.
#unknown So put it out.
#unknown He can't keep getting away with it! He can't keep getting away with it! He won't.
#unknown You really wanna burn him down? Let's do it together.
#unknown So you were fofollowing me? Yeah.
#unknown Since Goodman's.
#unknown Where we going now? DEA.
#unknown Downtown.
#unknown What, I'm, like, arrested? Yeah, you know how this works.
#unknown Be a good witness for me, it'll go better for you.
#unknown Yeah, sitting around MDC, waiting to be a witness against Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown It's It's gonna go great for me.
#unknown So you're angry.
#unknown I can't sleep.
#unknown I'm not eating.
#unknown Last night I was online for six hours looking up untraceable poisons.
#unknown This close family friend had been keeping a secret from you and Hank, and somehow this person's secret became known, and now you're sad and hurt and angry.
#unknown I'm I'm in the ballpark? To be this wrong about someone.
#unknown This off.
#unknown We all live doublelives to some extent, don't we?  We all have our secrets.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Not like this.
#unknown Not like him.
#unknown Marie, I think it's time you filled me in on some more details here.
#unknown Who and what are we talking about? I said I can't do that.
#unknown It'd be bad for Hank.
#unknown Our friend made that clear in his little movie.
#unknown Those kids under his roof.
#unknown That baby.
#unknown I'm sick just thinking about it.
#unknown How could I have not seen this? If I weren't being such a idiotic, stupid idiot, I could've We could have Blackjack winnings.
#unknown Nothing suspicious about that at all.
#unknown Tell me about this movie.
#unknown Dave, can't we simply just focus on my feelings here? The details don't really matter, do they? There is nothing to be done, okay? He screwed us, and he won.
#unknown Can we just Can we talk about something else, please? Yes? How's work? Last week, you were upset about the new parking rules.
#unknown Marie? Saxitotoxin.
#unknown "Derived from shellfish.
#unknown Produces a flaccid paralysis that leaves the victim conscious through a progression of symptoms.
#unknown Death occurs from respiratory failure.
#unknown " That is definitely a contender.
#unknown Marie, you're not ready to fill me in here, that's fine.
#unknown But I want you to listen.
#unknown There is no problem, no matter how difficult or painful or seemingly unsolvable, that violence won't make worse.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I Don't worry.
#unknown I wouldn't hurt anybody.
#unknown I just It just feels good to think about it.
#unknown Hey, babe.
#unknown What's the story here? Oh, uh, well, uh, something's come up.
#unknown I thought you might wanna get outta the house for a day or two.
#unknown You thought I might wanna pack up and move out of my own house.
#unknown Why? What's going on? Look, I don't wanna get into it now.
#unknown But you know that thing with Walt? There's, uh there's been a development.
#unknown What happened? Are you in danger? No.
#unknown No, no, no, not at all.
#unknown Just it's a fluid situation, and I think it might go a little smoother if you're not here.
#unknown So, I, uh it'll be great, you know? III booked you a spa package at La Posada.
#unknown You can do that river stones thing.
#unknown Hank, what the hell is going on? Hank? We have a guest.
#unknown He was a little keyedup.
#unknown Gave him a couple sleeping pills.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So listen.
#unknown I bring that kid in and and put him in the system, Walt's gonna find out five minutes later.
#unknown You know, my last ten witnesses died in jail, remember? Aaand I can't use a DEA safe house without writing him up.
#unknown I can't risk a a motel.
#unknown I know it sounds crazy, but this is the best place for him.
#unknown For now.
#unknown Just for a day or two, tops.
#unknown Okay, just answer me this one question Is this bad for Walt? Yeah.
#unknown Very.
#unknown Good.
#unknown I'm staying.
#unknown I'll heat up lasagna.
#unknown Phone's ringing.
#unknown You have one new voice mail.
#unknown Jesse, listen.
#unknown Uh I mean, obviously you've changed your mind here, and so thank you for that.
#unknown And I know you're angry.
#unknown And I wanna fix this, okay? Whatever it takes, all right? We'll talk, and we will fix this.
#unknown Until then, just just sleep it off, okay? And then call me.
#unknown Be safe.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown What are you still doing up? Couldn't sleep.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown You and me both.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Have a seat.
#unknown Everything okay?  Oh, yeah.
#unknown Just business stuff.

#unknown You guys still think you might buy another car wash? Oh, uh, yeah.
#unknown Well, maybe.
#unknown See how it goes.
#unknown How it goes now that now that you're you're sick again, right? No.
#unknown That's not what I mean.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Told you not to worry, remember? Hhow can I not worry? Come on.
#unknown You think I came all this way just to let something as silly as lung cancer take me down? Not a chance.
#unknown I'm not going anywhere.
#unknown Should've brought our suits, huh? It's okay.
#unknown It's all right.
#unknown I'll be up in a minute.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown See you in the morning.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Would you like some coffee? Morning.
#unknown You want some coffee? Uh, no.
#unknown Uh, the lady, um I think your wife You take cream and sugar? Uh, black's black's good.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Uh, thanks.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown This is probably gonna take awhile.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, yeah.
#unknown I'll run some errands.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Uh, you remember, uh, Agent Gomez? How you feeling? Your head clear? Yeah.
#unknown This this can't be what you mean by burning him to the ground, right? II got stories that'll make your toes curl, but, you know, it's just "My word against his word" kind of stuff.
#unknown So, you know, I don't really have any, like, proof or anything.
#unknown Gomie, can you, uh, grab the curtains over there? There's a there's a glare thing happening here.
#unknown You know he's retired, right? He's he's not even in the business anymore.
#unknown So you're never gonna catch him with a camcorder.
#unknown We're gonna catch him.
#unknown We gotta do this first, okay? Come on.
#unknown Just, uh, tell us everything you remember.
#unknown Any business dealings, any personal dealings, any criminal activity you were a witness or a party to.
#unknown Anything and everything.
#unknown Just tell us your story, okay? Start from the beginning.
#unknown When did you first meet Walter White? Right.
#unknown Okay, uh I first met Mr.
#unknown White Walter White in junior year chemistry.
#unknown He was my teacher.
#unknown You believe him? Yeah.
#unknown I do, unfortunately.
#unknown And I hate to admit it, but I think the kid is right.
#unknown There is no physical evidence, not that I heard.
#unknown Yeah, well, no weapons, no bodies, no working lab.
#unknown Just the word of one nutjob methhead against Mr.
#unknown RogersHasALungTumor.
#unknown So, do we take a run at Lydia RodarteQuayle? Vamonos Pest? Follow up with the Drew Sharp killing? Where do we start? I say we start with this.
#unknown Jesse, I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza tomorrow at noon.
#unknown I hope you'll give me the chance to explain myself and talk through everything once and for all.
#unknown I'll be alone and unarmed.
#unknown So if you wanna come and shoot me in the head, that's up to you.
#unknown Either way, I'm in your hands.
#unknown Whoa.
#unknown Whoa, whoa, whoa.
#unknown Go and talk to that asshole? You you can't be serious.
#unknown Go and listen.
#unknown He wants to explain himself.
#unknown We put a wire on you and let him explain.
#unknown So your plan is to do his plan? You you seriously think that this this whole "Once and for all in the Plaza" thing is so he can talk to me? Why not? I I I can't believe you two.
#unknown The dude wanted me out of town before I came to burn his house down, and now I'm even more of a threat to him, okay? And he's got a zerotolerance policy on threats, you know? If I go to this Plaza, I'm a dead man is why not.
#unknown Hey, Walt's ruthless.
#unknown He'll do just about anything to protect his interests.
#unknown I agree.
#unknown Except when it comes to you.
#unknown He cares about you.
#unknown Can't you see? Oh, yeah.
#unknown You mean when he's not, uh, ripping me off or calling me an idiot or poisoning people that I care about? Yeah, no, Mr.
#unknown White's gay for me.
#unknown Everyone knows that.
#unknown No, I mean it.
#unknown Based on everything you told us.
#unknown Uh, he paid for your rehab, uh, ran over those two drug dealers with his car.
#unknown Sounds like he saved your life.
#unknown Uh, made you a 5050 partner.
#unknown He didn't need to do that.
#unknown Yeah, no, he sort of did.
#unknown I'm the only one near as good as him, so I don't know.
#unknown The way you tell it, sounds to me like he's manipulating you to stick around.
#unknown Like he doesn't wanna lose you.
#unknown All those numbers he he runs on you, over and over, helping you find the ricin cigarette.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Look how far he'll go to show you to convince you that he's not such a bad guy.
#unknown That's what this is.
#unknown What if it's about, um, killing me, you know? You know, getting me out in the open, hire some, uh some clock tower guy, or or have me sit on a poison needle, or something, you know? Nothing's gonna happen to you.
#unknown I mean, the Plaza's one of the most wideopen public places in all of Albuquerque.
#unknown It's middle of the day.
#unknown And Agent Gomez and I will be right there with you.
#unknown Look look, you two guys are just guys, okay? Mr.
#unknown White he's the devil.
#unknown You know, he is he is smarter than you, he is luckier than you.
#unknown Whatever whatever you think is supposed to happen I'm telling you, the exact reverse opposite of that is gonna happen, okay? Jesse Jesse, we're not brainstorming here.
#unknown This is not asking.
#unknown Unless you know another way to get the man, or unless you wanna take your chances with the banger boys over in MDC, then this is it.
#unknown This is what's happening.
#unknown I gotta piss.
#unknown Can I piss? Yeah.
#unknown Down to the left.
#unknown You got another SD card? What? What if the kid's right? What if it's a trap? "The kid"? Oh, you mean the junkie murderer that's dribbling all over my guest bathroom floor? Well, then, he's right.
#unknown Pinkman gets killed, and we get it all on tape.
#unknown Remember, you're hurt, you're angry, but you're here for answers, okay? But don't, uh don't push the questions, okay? Let's not get him suspicious, all right? You let him do the talking, right? Just relax.
#unknown That's what that's what matters most.
#unknown Don't cross your arms, if you can help it.
#unknown Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
#unknown Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.
#unknown You getting that? Loud and clear, idiota.
#unknown How's it looking, Gomie? No change.
#unknown He's just sitting there.
#unknown Are we doing this, or what? Ready to kick some ass, partner? All right.
#unknown Time to go.
#unknown Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this? What's with the kid? He's just standing there.
#unknown What the hell's he doing? He's on the move now.
#unknown He's taking off.
#unknown I think he's running.
#unknown Oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown You got him? He's at the pay phone.
#unknown Who the hell is he calling? Oh, no.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Come on, kid.
#unknown No! Come on! Hello? Nice try, asshole.
#unknown Jesse, where are you? I just wanna talk to you.
#unknown No.
#unknown I'm not doing what you want anymore.
#unknown Okay, asshole? This is just a headsup to let you know I'm coming for you.
#unknown See, I decided that burning down your house is nothing.
#unknown Next time, I'm gonna get you where you really live.
#unknown Jesse, listen to me.
#unknown Jesse? Jesse?  Daddy! Daddy!  Hey! Get in.
#unknown Little son of a bitch! Stupid, high little What the hell was that all about, huh? What were you thinking?  Thinking there's another way.
#unknown What? To get him.
#unknown There's another way.
#unknown A better way.
#unknown Uh Hey.
#unknown It's Walt.
#unknown I'm okay.
#unknown I, uh Todd, I think I might have another job for your uncle.
#unknown
