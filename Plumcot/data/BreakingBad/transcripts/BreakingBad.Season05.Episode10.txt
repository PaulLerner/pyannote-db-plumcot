#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad I knew there would be a drop in quality, but, 68%? This is not what I agreed to.
#unknown I left a viable operation, the rest was up to you.
#unknown All along it was you! Hank, my cancer is back.
#unknown In six months you won't have someone to prosecute.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Take it.
#unknown Mariano, it's me.
#unknown I need you to get Skyler on the line.
#unknown No, no, I need you to get her on the phone right now.
#unknown Tell her it's urgent.
#unknown No What do you mean she won't get off the phone? I am giving you permission, Mariano.
#unknown You make her get off the phone.
#unknown Mariano, who is Skyler on the phone with? Yeah.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Where is she? Where's Skyler? She just kinda left.
#unknown She didn't say where she was going.
#unknown Skyler, my my head is spinning.
#unknown And yours I I can't even imagine.
#unknown So much makes sense to me now.
#unknown You jumping in the pool, you sending us your kids, I get it.
#unknown I just wished I'd seen it sooner.
#unknown He's a monster.
#unknown He's a Look, I don't know what he did to you to force you to keep his secrets.
#unknown If he threatened you, or whatever mind games he played.
#unknown I don't know if there was abuse.
#unknown But I want you to know that you can be open with me.
#unknown Don't hold anything back, okay? I mean, I don't even understand if you know the full extent of this, what he's done.
#unknown Not just the meth cooking, but the lives he's destroyed.
#unknown But, look, that's all behind you.
#unknown Starting now.
#unknown You're done being his victim.
#unknown Because here's what we're gonna do.
#unknown Sky.
#unknown Here's what we're gonna do.
#unknown You and the kids are gonna move back to our house where you'll be safe, where he can't get to you.
#unknown Hank, does Marie No.
#unknown No.
#unknown We'll get to that soon enough.
#unknown It's just you and me right now, okay? Okay.
#unknown Before we, um, before we get you back to the house, I I'm gonna ask you to tell me everything you can.
#unknown Um, take as long as you like.
#unknown Just, uh, start from the beginning when you first became aware of Walt's activities, and just just try to be as detailed as you can.
#unknown Uh, what Right right here? Right now? Sure.
#unknown Why not? While it's still fresh, you know? And just, uh, just, uh, remember to, uh, just state your name and the date before you start.
#unknown Hank, do Do we have to have to do this right now? No, we we don't have to do this right now.
#unknown No.
#unknown But just here's the thing.
#unknown You see, I need something solid that I can bring to my people.
#unknown A statement, on the record.
#unknown So you testifying to Walt's criminal activity, whatever you know, goes a long, long way here.
#unknown Okay? I mean, you see, building a case this big, gathering all this evidence, enough to get a conviction, we're talking a longhaul proposition here, and I don't want that bastard running out the clock.
#unknown But with your testimony Wait, what do you mean running out the clock? His cancer.
#unknown His cancer's back.
#unknown So he said.
#unknown He didn't tell you? Who's to say it's even true? Lying piece of shit.
#unknown Look, regardless, I mean, we'll just assume.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Okay? You know what? That son of a bitch looks me in the eye and he says if what I know is true, if he'll be dead before I can prove it.
#unknown The balls on that son of a I got all these little pieces.
#unknown They're all part of the story, right? But they don't mean much on their own.
#unknown But when you start telling me what you know, when you start filling in the gaps, I'll have him in lockup before the sun goes down.
#unknown Hank, I I I think maybe Maybe I need a lawyer.
#unknown What? No, no, no, no, you don't.
#unknown I I think maybe I do.
#unknown Skyler, understand, I am here to help you.
#unknown But to do that, I need your help.
#unknown We start bringing in lawyers and they start putting up roadblocks where they don't need to be, and my ability to control this situation diminishes.
#unknown Just for my own protection, it just, you know, it seems to make sense that I should have someone to talk to.
#unknown Skyler, I'm your your biggest advocate here, and I'm telling you, for your own good, you need to get out ahead of this thing.
#unknown I mean, you start, you know, getting defensive, I I'm not saying it's right, but I'll tell you it's a fact, the DA will look at you differently.
#unknown But you don't know that.
#unknown Skyler, yes, I I do.
#unknown I've been around long enough to know.
#unknown It's in your best interest to get out there and show the world you have nothing to hide.
#unknown Look no one in the world is more important to me than your sister.
#unknown So believe me when I tell you that your best interest and mine are the same.
#unknown But, Hank, you telling me not to talk to a lawyer doesn't sound like that at all.
#unknown It sounds like what you want What you want is to get Walt.
#unknown At all costs.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay, let's just Slow down.
#unknown Slow down.
#unknown You can You can talk to a lawyer later.
#unknown But right now, what we need to do, we need to go get the kids, we need to bring them to my house where they're safe, and then we need to help each other put this animal away, okay? Come on.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown No, come on.
#unknown Let's go to the house and we'll deal with it there.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Am I under arrest? What? Am I under arrest? Skyler, I I You're not thinking straight about this.
#unknown You have to listen to me.
#unknown I Skyler.
#unknown Skyler Skyler Skyler  Am I under arrest?  No, no, no.
#unknown Am I under arrest?  No.
#unknown Sky shh.
#unknown Hank, are you arresting me?  Sky Am I under arrest?! Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
#unknown I gotta do it, man.
#unknown Dude.
#unknown Mm.
#unknown What are you doing? Huell.
#unknown Hey, quit screwing around.
#unknown Mm.
#unknown We are here to do a job, not channel Scrooge McDuck.
#unknown You hearin' me? I hear ya.
#unknown Dude.
#unknown Mm, mm, mm.
#unknown Ah, screw it.

#unknown Yeah, it's me.
#unknown Again.
#unknown Listen, kid, you've got to hide those bags.
#unknown The monkey is in the banana patch, capisce? So call me.
#unknown This was the third message.
#unknown Where the hell is that kid? That's her.
#unknown Don't.
#unknown I have to talk to her.
#unknown You don't have to do You answer that phone and Schrader's on the other end of the line with a legal wire tap recording everything you say, you're not doing anybody any favors.
#unknown Except for him.
#unknown In fact, why do you still have a battery in that thing? Take it out.
#unknown They might be trying to triangulate your movements.
#unknown I'm not being paranoid.
#unknown Do it.
#unknown Can't believe she went to him.
#unknown She just panicked.
#unknown She went right to him without even talking to me.
#unknown Without a moment's hesitation.
#unknown I'm not saying it's not bad.
#unknown It's bad.
#unknown But it could be worse.
#unknown Really.
#unknown How much worse could it be, exactly, in your estimation? What does she actually know? What has she seen, hmm? Nothing.
#unknown It's hearsay.
#unknown It's all he said, she said.
#unknown I mean, the only real evidence that she can lead them to is your money, and once we take care of that, well, then they got nothing.
#unknown Nothing? Hank knows.
#unknown That's not nothing.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I can't exactly see him turning the other cheek.
#unknown Of course there's always, um Always what? Well, have you given any thought to, um, sending him on a trip to Belize? Belize? Yeah.
#unknown Belize.
#unknown You know, where, uh, where Mike went to.
#unknown Off on a trip to, uh, Belize.
#unknown Saul, you better not be saying what I think you're saying.
#unknown It's just conjecture on my part.
#unknown Hank is family! Okay, it's an option that You understand that? It's an option that has worked very well for you in the recent past.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown What is wrong with you? My mistake.
#unknown Family.
#unknown Off limits.
#unknown Of course.
#unknown I'm just throwing thoughts out there.
#unknown This is a safe room, right? Jesus.
#unknown Send him to Belize.
#unknown I'll send you to Belize.
#unknown Finally.
#unknown It's about time.
#unknown Have you two been followed? Are you sure? If they had, we'd all be in handcuffs right now.
#unknown I, uh, took the tops off.
#unknown Figured you'd want to check to make sure it's still all there.
#unknown You figured right.
#unknown Close enough.
#unknown Hey, if you need any help on the other end.
#unknown Yeah, these things are a bitch to move on your own.
#unknown I'll manage.
#unknown And we don't mind overtime.
#unknown Ain't no thing.
#unknown Pay Huell and Kuby and take your cut.
#unknown The rest is mine.
#unknown Insurance in case I need you.
#unknown In case you need me? I'm thinking the probability is high.
#unknown Just find Jesse.
#unknown Keys.
#unknown Saul Goodman, please.
#unknown Skyler White.
#unknown No, no, please please don't tell me he isn't there.
#unknown I know he's been avoiding my calls.
#unknown All right, well, um, has my husband been there? What do you mean you don't know? Either he has or he hasn't.
#unknown I don't Sweetie Shit.
#unknown Sky.
#unknown Sky, I know you're home.

#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Just you.
#unknown Not Hank.
#unknown Tell me Hank is crazy.
#unknown Tell me he doesn't know what he's talking about.
#unknown You gotta give me something, Skyler.

#unknown It can't be true.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown How long have you known? Hank said that when you walked into the pool, that's when you knew.
#unknown When you had your But not then.
#unknown Before that.
#unknown Since Gus Fring? The money.

#unknown I am so sorry.
#unknown You're sorry You're I'm You won't talk You won't talk to Hank because you think that Walt is going to get away with this.

#unknown Let's go.
#unknown Marie.
#unknown Marie.

#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown Okay, mama has you now.
#unknown Mama has you now.
#unknown Mama has you.
#unknown Shh.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay, it's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown You have to get him.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Where have you been? Oh, my God.
#unknown What happened? You moved the money, didn't you? You buried it somewhere.
#unknown Did you get my messages? I told Hank nothing.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown I swear I didn't.
#unknown Say something.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown How how long was I out? Oh, about four or five hours.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown How are you feeling? It's true.
#unknown The cancer's back.
#unknown Is this it? Does that make you happy? I can't remember the last time I was happy.
#unknown Just tell me.
#unknown I know you talked with Hank.
#unknown I know you made a deal.
#unknown Skyler, I'll make this easy.
#unknown I'll give myself up.
#unknown If you promise me one thing.
#unknown You keep the money.
#unknown Never speak of it.
#unknown Never give it up.
#unknown You pass it on to our children.
#unknown Give them everything.
#unknown Will you do that? Please? Please don't let me have done all this for nothing.
#unknown How did Hank find out? Did did somebody talk? No, no one talked.
#unknown It was me.
#unknown I screwed up.
#unknown The way Hank talks he's got his suspicions.
#unknown Not much else.
#unknown You can't give yourself up without giving up the money.
#unknown It's the way this works, Walt.
#unknown So maybe our best move here is to stay quiet.
#unknown Okay, you can take it off now.
#unknown All right, what's so important you had to come all the way out here? For the amount of money I'm bringing in, I think I deserve to see exactly why it's all going so wrong.
#unknown Are you an expert on meth labs now? Are you gonna tell us how to fix our operation? And what if I can help? What will it hurt to show me? I I don't like my time being wasted.
#unknown Well, I'm here, and ten minutes is a small sacrifice when we're talking about a $50 million shortfall.
#unknown So? Safe to come down? Yeah.
#unknown You're good.
#unknown Ladies first.
#unknown Okay, now you've seen it.
#unknown Yep.
#unknown Now I've seen it.
#unknown What? Well, how about we start with it's filthy? What are you, my mother? What, filthy? It's just dimly lit.
#unknown Do you seriously think this is up to the standards of your predecessor? Because it's not.
#unknown Not even close.
#unknown Yeah, well, the product we're making, it's selling just fine.
#unknown Heisenberg's standards don't matter anymore.
#unknown To whom? A bunch of scabby Arizona tweakers? They matter to my buyer in the Czech Republic, I can tell you that.
#unknown Therefore, they matter to me.
#unknown Look, I cannot move what this person is making if it's substandard.
#unknown And it is.
#unknown It just is.
#unknown No offense.
#unknown You can do better, do better.
#unknown Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.
#unknown I mean, you tried to get the man back, right? He said no, so I mean, what do you want me to do? Todd.
#unknown Use Todd again.
#unknown Look, he learned from him, all right? At least Todd's first two cooks were at 74%.
#unknown On his third cook, he started a fire.
#unknown Look, I tried Heisenberg's way.
#unknown It didn't work out.
#unknown I wanna cook in my territory, I wanna use guys that I trust, not Todd, who I don't.
#unknown And that's the end of the conversation as far as I'm concerned.
#unknown I really wish you'd have given him a chance.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown We have a problem.
#unknown You stay here.
#unknown Hello? Ma'am, you okay? Hello? Safe to come up whenever you want.
#unknown I I don't want to see.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Cool, so I guess maybe, um Maybe just close your eyes? Okay.
#unknown This way.
#unknown To your right.
#unknown Are you kidding me with this? Uncle Jack.
#unknown Fire in the hole.
#unknown It's okay.
#unknown Sorry about that.
#unknown It's cool, lady.
#unknown Okay, boys.
#unknown Let's take it all.
#unknown Let's get everything.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown You, uh going into work today? You're kidding, right? What about you? Are you going to the office? You have to tell them, Hank.
#unknown Today.
#unknown Marie, I just just don't have it yet.
#unknown The piece I need to prove it all, it's just it's just not here.
#unknown Then let them help you.
#unknown Tell Steve, tell Ramey.
#unknown You've got enough to get them to believe your story at least.
#unknown Put the whole DEA on it.
#unknown That's how this is supposed to work, right? No.
#unknown No? What no? What are you, Lone Wolf McQuade? Look, baby You've gotta go in with this, Hank.
#unknown Look, the day I go in with this, that's the last day of my career, all right? I'm going to have to walk in there, look those people in the eye, and admit that the person I've been chasing the past year is my own brotherinlaw? It's over for me.
#unknown Ten seconds after I tell this story, I'm a civilian.
#unknown And then how can we help Skyler? If she comes to her senses.
#unknown When I go in there I'm bringing proof, not suspicions.
#unknown I can be the man who caught him.
#unknown At least.
#unknown What if you wait and they catch Walt without you? If they find out that you knew and you said nothing? Hank, wouldn't you go to jail too? Hey, Hank.
#unknown Welcome back.
#unknown Morning.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Look who's back.
#unknown I had to see it with my own eyes.
#unknown How you doing? Good.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown You miss me? Miss you? Like my balls miss jock itch, maybe.
#unknown I didn't know you had balls.
#unknown All right, don't make me sorry I stopped by here.
#unknown Anyway, uh, you got a budget meeting in an hour, and then you got a meet and greet with the new Prescription Taskforce guys, all right? All right.
#unknown Hey, uh, you know, listen.
#unknown Let's see if we can get that budget meeting pushed, and instead see if you could set up a conference call with Ramey.
#unknown What for? Just a "getting back up to speed" thing.
#unknown You know, for me.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown Did you hear about that money thing? No, what what money thing? Oh, you're gonna love this.
#unknown It involves your old pal Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Pinkman? I'll give you this.
#unknown Jesse, you're never boring.
#unknown Not boring at all.
#unknown So come on, buddy.
#unknown Share with us.
#unknown Why were you tossing millions of dollars all over Albuquerque? I promise you we can hold out just as long as you can.
#unknown That's a fact.
#unknown I got a bladder the size of a hot water bottle.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown All that cash?  I wouldn't be able to stop talking about it.
#unknown I know, right? But I don't think I'd be tossing it out my car window.
#unknown My takehome definitely doesn't allow for that whole Robin Hood thing.
#unknown But apparently Jesse here is just raking it in.
#unknown Yes, indeed.
#unknown And I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable explanation for where he got it.
#unknown He found it.
#unknown Or won it in a card game, maybe.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown Won it in a card game.
#unknown Lucky night at the casino.
#unknown Jesse, did you have a lucky night? Okay.
#unknown Jesse, we're gonna let you gather your thoughts so we can continue this stimulating conversation.
#unknown Can we get you anything? Coffee? A soda? Right.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Thought not.
#unknown I have a history with Jesse Pinkman, and I think he can be helpful to me on another active investigation.
#unknown Look, I'm only asking for a couple minutes here.
#unknown You said he wasn't talking? Let me tell you, that kid hates my guts.
#unknown Despises me, okay? Maybe I can get him cranked up enough that he starts yapping.
#unknown Then you guys go in there, get what you need from the little shitstain, finish him off.
#unknown Gives me anything useful while he's with me, I'll share it, I could use a smoke break.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown How about you? Yeah.
#unknown Maybe you could keep an eye on our suspect for us,  just for a few minutes.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown I can do that.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Thank you, guys.
#unknown
