walter_white  Fine by me.
skyler_white  So l figured a lowkey family dinner, no official party and we bite the bullet and buy him a car.

skyler_white  Airbags, safetyrated, all that.
skyler_white  Do you have any thoughts on what kind?
skyler_white  Or should l just go ahead and

walter_white  You're turning a profit?
skyler_white  We're coming close.
skyler_white  Give us another month or two and, yeah, we'll be there.

hank_schrader  Good.
hank_schrader  What you doing?
hank_schrader  Hey, listen, l'll cut to it

hank_schrader  How he never goes anywhere.
hank_schrader  One restaurant, home, back and forth?
hank_schrader  l'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns So
hank_schrader  So l start thinking about this little empire of his.
hank_schrader  Fourteen restaurants.
hank_schrader  Who supplies them
hank_schrader  them? What's the base of operations?
hank_schrader  So l do a little digging, and bingo.
hank_schrader  Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center
hank_schrader  lt's not far from town.
hank_schrader  The place is huge.
hank_schrader  l mean l'm looking at it online now.
hank_schrader  lt's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings or hatcheries, whatever you call them
hank_schrader  Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
hank_schrader  Sounds promising, right?
hank_schrader  So, what do you say, buddy?
hank_schrader  Got another field trip in you?
walter_white  You know, Hank,
walter_white  l'm l'm l mean, it sounds great, it really does.

walter_white  l just want to say first off, don't be angry.
mike_ehrmantraut  What is it, Walter?
walter_white  My brotherinlaw, my DE He.

walter_white  Just look around for things.
skyler_white  Thank you.
skyler_white  Please give this to your carcare professional.
skyler_white  So a hand wax for you today?

ted_beneke  Hey, Sky.
skyler_white  God.
skyler_white  Ted.
skyler_white  What are you?
ted_beneke  Someone from the office said you worked down here.
ted_beneke  So l thought l'd come down and say
skyler_white  Well hello.
ted_beneke  You look great.
skyler_white  No
skyler_white  No. No, l don't.
skyler_white  l probably just look crazed.
ted_beneke  Not at all.
ted_beneke  You look happy.
ted_beneke  Last time l saw you.
ted_beneke  Hi, there. l guess, Skyler l'm gonna need to talk to you.
skyler_white  Ted
ted_beneke  really don't think we have anything to talk about. Actually, we do.
skyler_white  An audit?
skyler_white  Wait, an audit tomorrow?
skyler_white  How long have you had this?
ted_beneke  while.
ted_beneke  l debated, you know, contacting you
skyler_white  Contact me?
skyler_white  What about a lawyer, Ted? Ted,
skyler_white  is.
skyler_white  This is the ClD.
skyler_white  The criminal division.
skyler_white  God, you're facing a felony charge here.
skyler_white  A $1 00,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe plus five years in prison.
ted_beneke  Yeah.
ted_beneke  lt's bad.
skyler_white  Yeah
skyler_white  lt most certainly is.
ted_beneke  Look, here's the thing.
ted_beneke  l was wondering, maybe if you could help with this.
skyler_white  Help
skyler_white  Help how?
ted_beneke  Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could undo what's in there.
skyler_white  You want me to uncook your books?
ted_beneke  Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use Ted
skyler_white  Ted, it doesn't work like that.
skyler_white  The damage is already
skyler_white  My name.
skyler_white  My signatures are all over those books.
ted_beneke  Skyler, l'm accountable, not you.
skyler_white  Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay?
skyler_white  Once the ClD sees this is willful tax fraud they will build the strongest possible case against you.
skyler_white  Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
skyler_white  That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted everyone involved in those books.
skyler_white  can't have this in my life.
skyler_white  l cannot be audited.
ted_beneke  Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay?
ted_beneke  They're after me.
ted_beneke  lt's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
ted_beneke  l'm sorry.
ted_beneke  Look,
ted_beneke  l don't want you to worry, okay?
ted_beneke  going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
ted_beneke  Okay?
mike_ehrmantraut  Here.
jesse_pinkman  So is he gonna kill him
mike_ehrmantraut  ls who gonna kill who?
jesse_pinkman  Gus. ls he gonna kill Mr. White's brotherinlaw?
jesse_pinkman  l mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right?
jesse_pinkman  logical for him to off the dude.
jesse_pinkman  DEA agent poking around your junk.
jesse_pinkman  Who needs that, right?
jesse_pinkman  Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
jesse_pinkman  But killing a cop l don't know
jesse_pinkman  lt could look suspicious if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
jesse_pinkman  Then there's There's Mr. White who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
jesse_pinkman  never cook for Gus again.
jesse_pinkman  Guess there's a
mike_ehrmantraut  to consider. lf something were to happen to him, would you have a problem
jesse_pinkman  with that? Who really cares what l think?
mike_ehrmantraut  You get comfortable, kid.
mike_ehrmantraut  We may be here
gustavo_fring  Hey. Get down! Tell them the answer is"
walter_white  yes." Should l even ask?
mike_ehrmantraut  l wouldn't.
walter_white  So, what?
walter_white  ls this going to be a regular thing now
walter_white  Meth cooking and corpse disposal?
walter_white  Jesus.
mike_ehrmantraut  Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
walter_white  What was it this time
walter_white  What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?
walter_white  Or did Gus need to send another message?
mike_ehrmantraut  Shut your mouth.
mike_ehrmantraut  shut your mouth or l'll shut it for you.
mike_ehrmantraut  l don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
mike_ehrmantraut  Just get the barrel.
mike_ehrmantraut  if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again you go ahead and get two barrels.
jesse_pinkman  Like l guess l never thanked you for what you did.
jesse_pinkman  Thanks.
mike_ehrmantraut  Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
mike_ehrmantraut  Move your feet
mike_ehrmantraut  Running and so forth.
jesse_pinkman  seriously,
jesse_pinkman  What was the deal with Gus?
mike_ehrmantraut  The deal?
jesse_pinkman  That Terminator shit.
jesse_pinkman  Walking right into the bullets.
jesse_pinkman  What the hell was he doing?
mike_ehrmantraut  cartel needs Gus.
mike_ehrmantraut  His distribution network.
mike_ehrmantraut  They're not looking to kill
jesse_pinkman  him. But
jesse_pinkman  The rest of us are like open season?
jesse_pinkman  ls he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out for target practice while he
mike_ehrmantraut  he?
mike_ehrmantraut  Kid. Enough
mike_ehrmantraut  You got questions, ask him yourself.
james_picarus  And here again.
james_picarus  Unreported income.
james_picarus  That's more than a year straight so far.
james_picarus  You want to say something about this?
james_picarus  l'm having a hard time figuring it out
ted_beneke  l'd have to have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
james_picarus  Take all the time you need, Mr. Beneke. That's
james_picarus  That's why we're here.
skyler_white  Oh, l am so sorry l am late.
skyler_white  l got lost.
skyler_white  Hey, Ted.
ted_beneke  Sky.
skyler_white  This building is so confusing.
skyler_white  There are doors everywhere.
skyler_white  Hi. You
skyler_white  You are?
james_picarus  Special Agent James Bekaris.
skyler_white  Special.
james_picarus  Ms. white, you are the accountant of record for many of these reports, is that correct?
skyler_white  Guilty as charged.
james_picarus  Can you shed light on this history of missing revenue?
skyler_white  Missing?
skyler_white  No, it's there.
james_picarus  No.
james_picarus  Revenue most definitely flowed through this company but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
skyler_white  Let's take a look.
skyler_white  Oh, well, you know this account here, that is Mr. Keller's account.
skyler_white  And Mr. Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
skyler_white  He always sends an electronic payment which l hate, because l'm a realpaper person.
skyler_white  Mr. Keller is one of those environmental people.
skyler_white  Since there wasn't a physical check l didn't enter it into the book.
skyler_white  But the money is there.
james_picarus  Ms. white, you've read Section 61 of the lRC?
skyler_white  l did not follow what you just said.
james_picarus  How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
skyler_white  Well, l think l am.
james_picarus  No, you're not.
skyler_white  Well, you know what they say about opinions, right?
skyler_white  Everyone's got one.
skyler_white  But seriously, l am.
james_picarus  lt doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check
skyler_white  nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right?
james_picarus  Quicken.
james_picarus  You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size. l
skyler_white  l did.
skyler_white  Do you guys use that here?
skyler_white  Because it is the best.
skyler_white  lt's like having a calculator on your computer.
skyler_white  Amazing. Ms
james_picarus  white, how did you get this
skyler_white  job? Ted hired me.
james_picarus  No, l mean your qualifications.
james_picarus  What are your qualifications?
james_picarus  Where did you get your training?
skyler_white  Well, l haven't had any training, per se.
skyler_white  l've always been naturally good with numbers.
skyler_white  Got a good instinct for them.
skyler_white  Right, Teddy?
james_picarus  This
james_picarus  This is all falling into place now.
james_picarus  Ms. white, l just have to ask.
james_picarus  You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you?
skyler_white  Right now?
skyler_white  No.
skyler_white  l'm a cashier at a car wash.
ted_beneke  not really clear about what happened in there.
skyler_white  What happened was good news.
skyler_white  lgnorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality.
skyler_white  lt equates to ignorance.
skyler_white  Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties and move on from this.
skyler_white  Just put it behind you.
ted_beneke  Pay with what? l
ted_beneke  owe them $61 7,000. What
ted_beneke  What am l?
skyler_white  Look, just figure it out, all right?
skyler_white  you've just dodged prison.
skyler_white  Sell your assets.
skyler_white  Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage Second
ted_beneke  Second mortgage?
ted_beneke  l have a lien on my house.
ted_beneke  l don't have any assets.
ted_beneke  There are no assets left to sell.
skyler_white  Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation and that little fiction l just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
skyler_white  You have
ted_beneke  Wish l could.
gustavo_fring  in. l hope you brought an appetite.
jesse_pinkman  l guess.
gustavo_fring  Mike mentioned you have some questions.

gustavo_fring  Walter's formula.
gustavo_fring  Can you produce his product without any help?
gustavo_fring  Alone.

jesse_pinkman  Let's talk like men.
jesse_pinkman  You kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
gustavo_fring  That is not what l asked you.
gustavo_fring  You are here because circumstances with the cartel are untenable.
gustavo_fring  And l need your help.
gustavo_fring  l need you to help prevent an allout war.
gustavo_fring  Now, if you would answer the question.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, you headed out?
jesse_pinkman  Yo, Mr. White, hey.
jesse_pinkman  l really gotta talk to you.
jesse_pinkman  l don't know if you're with your family or whatever, but this is important so l'm hoping you could come

jesse_pinkman  of me. Just blew his head open.
jesse_pinkman  Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
jesse_pinkman  Anyway, they've been holding them off.
jesse_pinkman  But between the cartel taking potshots and your brotherinlaw trying to throw a net over the whole deal it's like what you call a rockandahardplace situation. So
jesse_pinkman  So, Gus is ls gonna cave.
jesse_pinkman  So the cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation and they want your formula.
jesse_pinkman  And he's gonna give it to them.
jesse_pinkman  Well, l l gotta give it to them
jesse_pinkman  l mean, l'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue.
jesse_pinkman  You know, and Gus doesn't trust you so l gotta go.
