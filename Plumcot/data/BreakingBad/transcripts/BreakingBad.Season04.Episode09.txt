#unknown You? Fine by me.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So l figured a lowkey family dinner, no official party and we bite the bullet and buy him a car.
#unknown Used, l was thinking, would be best.
#unknown But no more than five years old.
#unknown Airbags, safetyrated, all that.
#unknown Do you have any thoughts on what kind? Or should l just go ahead and Yeah.
#unknown You just go ahead.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Listen, on another subject, I just wanted to tell you that business is good.
#unknown Really good.
#unknown So good that l'm thinking, maybe you don't need to even work your second job.
#unknown You're turning a profit? We're coming close.
#unknown Give us another month or two and, yeah, we'll be there.
#unknown All of this to say maybe you could start thinking about an exit strategy.
#unknown l'm working on it.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hello? Hey, buddy.
#unknown Wake you? No, Hank.
#unknown l'm up.
#unknown Good.
#unknown What you doing? l'm.
#unknown Hey, listen, l'll cut to it.
#unknown Another favor to ask.
#unknown l'm thinking about Gus Fring.
#unknown How he never goes anywhere.
#unknown One restaurant, home, back and forth? l'm even more convinced it's bullshit because he owns So l start thinking about this little empire of his.
#unknown Fourteen restaurants.
#unknown Who supplies them? What's the base of operations? So l do a little digging, and bingo.
#unknown Pollos Hermanos has a main distribution center.
#unknown lt's not far from town.
#unknown The place is huge.
#unknown l mean l'm looking at it online now.
#unknown lt's a big warehouse and rows of these long, poultry buildings or hatcheries, whatever you call them.
#unknown Lots of space to hide illicit activity.
#unknown Sounds promising, right? So, what do you say, buddy? Got another field trip in you? You know, Hank, l'm l'm l'm l mean, it sounds great, it really does.
#unknown But l'm You know, l won't lie.
#unknown You've caught me somewhat indisposed.

#unknown That's embarrassing.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown You know, it's just upset stomach and, you know, everything Yeah.
#unknown lt's out of control.
#unknown And it's really explosive.
#unknown Bad TexMex at the mall.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, yeah.
#unknown l get it.
#unknown You don't have to paint a picture.
#unknown One guy in a diaper is enough for this trip.
#unknown Yeah, and l'm sorry, Hank.
#unknown Hey, don't be.
#unknown l've been asking a lot of you lately.
#unknown l appreciate it.
#unknown l'll find another ride.
#unknown Another ride? Yeah.
#unknown l'm sure l can get someone else to take me.
#unknown My trainer, Chuck.
#unknown Maybe l'll ask him.
#unknown Well, look, l'm This is probably just a 24hour thing.
#unknown Maybe 48 hours at the most.
#unknown And do you think you can possibly hold off for a day or two? Jeez, buddy, l mean, l.
#unknown You know, l just I would just really love to be the one to be able to take you there.
#unknown And, l mean, l've just really enjoyed, you know, the time with you and helping you and Well, yeah.
#unknown Okay, sure.
#unknown lf it means that much to you.
#unknown Just, you know, give me a call when you're feeling up to it.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown l will.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Mike, listen.
#unknown l just want to say first off, don't be angry.
#unknown What is it, Walter? My brotherinlaw, my DE He.
#unknown Soon, he will probably, in the near future take a ride out to a certain distribution center to look around for things.
#unknown Just look around for things.
#unknown And, yeah.
#unknown Mike? Where's this all going? Elsewhere.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Please give this to your carcare professional.
#unknown So a hand wax for you today? Okay, great.
#unknown Please give this to your carcare professional.
#unknown And the black Explorer, we could shampoo your floor mats but deluxe detailing is the best for your buck.
#unknown And SUV's are extra.
#unknown And please give this to your carcare professional.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Please give this to your carcare professional.
#unknown Hey, Sky.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Ted.
#unknown What are you? Someone from the office said you worked down here.
#unknown So l thought l'd come down and say hi.
#unknown Well hello.
#unknown You look great.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, l don't.
#unknown l probably just look crazed.
#unknown Not at all.
#unknown You look happy.
#unknown Last time l saw you.
#unknown Hi, there.
#unknown l guess, Skyler l'm gonna need to talk to you.
#unknown Ted, l really don't think we have anything to talk about.
#unknown Actually, we do.
#unknown An audit? Wait, an audit tomorrow? How long have you had this? A while.
#unknown l debated, you know, contacting you.
#unknown Contact me? What about a lawyer, Ted? Ted, this is.
#unknown This is the ClD.
#unknown The criminal division.
#unknown My God, you're facing a felony charge here.
#unknown A $1 00,000 fine on top of the taxes you already owe plus five years in prison.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown lt's bad.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown lt most certainly is.
#unknown Look, here's the thing.
#unknown l was wondering, maybe if you could help with this.
#unknown Help? Help how? Well, with your knowledge of how the books got the way they are, maybe there's some way you could undo what's in there.
#unknown You want me to uncook your books? Maybe there's some method or some accounting trick you could use Ted, it doesn't work like that.
#unknown The damage is already My name.
#unknown My signatures are all over those books.
#unknown Skyler, l'm accountable, not you.
#unknown Let me explain what's going to happen here, okay? Once the ClD sees this is willful tax fraud they will build the strongest possible case against you.
#unknown Once they start down that path, they have an 80 percent conviction rate.
#unknown That's because they're allowed to monitor your mail and tap your phones, and not just you, Ted everyone involved in those books.
#unknown l can't have this in my life.
#unknown l cannot be audited.
#unknown Skyler, you're going to be fine, okay? They're after me.
#unknown lt's the captain they want, not some cashier at a car wash.
#unknown No offense.
#unknown l'm sorry.
#unknown l.
#unknown Look, l don't want you to worry, okay? l'm going to figure out a way through this, somehow.
#unknown Okay? Here.
#unknown So is he gonna kill him? ls who gonna kill who? Gus.
#unknown ls he gonna kill Mr.
#unknown White's brotherinlaw? l mean, he's the reason for all of this here, right? Because it's totally logical for him to off the dude.
#unknown Ahole DEA agent poking around your junk.
#unknown Who needs that, right? Makes sense to get rid of him for good.
#unknown But killing a cop l don't know.
#unknown lt could look suspicious if the dude who's investigating you suddenly up and dies.
#unknown Then there's There's Mr.
#unknown White who would be even more apeshit if he had family getting murdered.
#unknown He'd never cook for Gus again.
#unknown Guess there's a lot of angles to consider.
#unknown lf something were to happen to him, would you have a problem with that? Who really cares what l think? Son of a bitch.
#unknown You get comfortable, kid.
#unknown We may be here a while.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Get down! Tell them the answer is "yes.
#unknown " Should l even ask? l wouldn't.
#unknown So, what? ls this going to be a regular thing now? Meth cooking and corpse disposal? Jesus.
#unknown Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.
#unknown What was it this time? What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus? Or did Gus need to send another message? Shut your mouth.
#unknown You shut your mouth or l'll shut it for you.
#unknown l don't want you talking to me or Jesse.
#unknown Just get the barrel.
#unknown And if you ever plan on calling the cops on one of my guys again you go ahead and get two barrels.
#unknown Like l guess l never thanked you for what you did.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Next time don't stand there like an idiot.
#unknown Move your feet.
#unknown Running and so forth.
#unknown But seriously, what? What was the deal with Gus? The deal? That Terminator shit.
#unknown Walking right into the bullets.
#unknown What the hell was he doing? The cartel needs Gus.
#unknown His distribution network.
#unknown They're not looking to kill him.
#unknown But, what? The rest of us are like open season? ls he doing anything about that, or do we keep hanging out for target practice while he? Kid.
#unknown Enough.
#unknown You got questions, ask him yourself.
#unknown And here again.
#unknown Unreported income.
#unknown That's more than a year straight so far.
#unknown You want to say something about this? l'm having a hard time figuring it out.
#unknown l'd have to have a look at the copies of the receipts to refresh my memory.
#unknown Take all the time you need, Mr.
#unknown Beneke.
#unknown That's why we're here.
#unknown Oh, l am so sorry l am late.
#unknown l got lost.
#unknown Hey, Ted.
#unknown Sky.
#unknown This building is so confusing.
#unknown There are doors everywhere.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown You are? Special Agent James Bekaris.
#unknown "Special.
#unknown " Skyler White.
#unknown Ms.
#unknown white, you are the accountant of record for many of these reports, is that correct? Guilty as charged.
#unknown Can you shed light on this history of missing revenue? Missing? No, it's there.
#unknown No.
#unknown Revenue most definitely flowed through this company but it's not all accounted for in your reports.
#unknown Let's take a look.
#unknown Oh, well, you know this account here, that is Mr.
#unknown Keller's account.
#unknown And Mr.
#unknown Keller is an old friend of Ted's dad.
#unknown He always sends an electronic payment which l hate, because l'm a realpaper person.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Keller is one of those environmental people.
#unknown Since there wasn't a physical check l didn't enter it into the book.
#unknown But the money is there.
#unknown Ms.
#unknown white, you've read Section 61 of the lRC? l did not follow what you just said.
#unknown How gross income for a business is defined, you're not allowed to do that.
#unknown Well, l think l am.
#unknown No, you're not.
#unknown Well, you know what they say about opinions, right? Everyone's got one.
#unknown But seriously, l am.
#unknown lt doesn't matter if it's an electronic check or a paper check nothing flashed red, so that's gotta mean it's okay, right? Quicken.
#unknown You used Quicken to manage books for a business this size.
#unknown l did.
#unknown Do you guys use that here? Because it is the best.
#unknown lt's like having a calculator on your computer.
#unknown Amazing.
#unknown Ms.
#unknown white, how did you get this job? Ted hired me.
#unknown No, l mean your qualifications.
#unknown What are your qualifications? Where did you get your training? Well, l haven't had any training, per se.
#unknown l've always been naturally good with numbers.
#unknown Got a good instinct for them.
#unknown Right, Teddy? Right.
#unknown This is all falling into place now.
#unknown Ms.
#unknown white, l just have to ask.
#unknown You're not managing accounts anywhere else, are you? Right now? No.
#unknown l'm a cashier at a car wash.
#unknown l'm not really clear about what happened in there.
#unknown What happened was good news.
#unknown lgnorance of the law doesn't equate to criminality.
#unknown lt equates to ignorance.
#unknown Pay your back taxes, pay the penalties and move on from this.
#unknown Just put it behind you.
#unknown Pay with what? l owe them $61 7,000.
#unknown What am l? Look, just figure it out, all right? And you've just dodged prison.
#unknown Sell your assets.
#unknown Get rid of the BMW, take out a second mortgage Second mortgage? l have a lien on my house.
#unknown l don't have any assets.
#unknown There are no assets left to sell.
#unknown Ted, if you don't pay them, they will reopen the investigation and that little fiction l just spun up there is gonna completely unravel.
#unknown You have to settle.
#unknown Wish l could.
#unknown Come in.
#unknown l hope you brought an appetite.
#unknown Yeah, l guess.
#unknown Mike mentioned you have some questions.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown We'll eat first, and then we'll talk.
#unknown Right on.
#unknown What am l doing here? l know you have concerns.
#unknown What happened yesterday, to my man at the farm it was a terrible thing.
#unknown The dude getting his head blown off? Yeah.
#unknown l've invited you into my home prepared food so we could sit and talk.
#unknown Discuss what's going on in this business our business, like men.
#unknown And l will explain everything that is happening.
#unknown l will answer your questions.
#unknown But first l need you to answer one question for me.
#unknown Can you cook Walter's formula? What? Walter's formula.
#unknown Can you produce his product without any help? Alone.
#unknown No.
#unknown Why? You're asking me if l can cook Mr.
#unknown white's crystal? Without him? Me? The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago.
#unknown This your plan? lnvite me in your house, make whatever this is be my buddy and make me feel important.
#unknown Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr.
#unknown white? You wanna You wanna talk like men? Let's talk like men.
#unknown You kill Mr.
#unknown White, you're gonna have to kill me too.
#unknown That is not what l asked you.

#unknown And l need your help.
#unknown l need you to help prevent an allout war.
#unknown Now, if you would answer the question.
#unknown Hey, you headed out? Yeah.
#unknown Yo, Mr.
#unknown White, hey.

#unknown And yesterday, that dude we brought to the lab.
#unknown l mean, they shot him right in front of me.
#unknown Just blew his head open.
#unknown Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away.
#unknown Anyway, they've been holding them off.
#unknown But between the cartel taking potshots and your brotherinlaw trying to throw a net over the whole deal it's like what you call a rockandahardplace situation.
#unknown So, Gus is ls gonna cave.

#unknown And he's gonna give it to them.
#unknown Well, l l gotta give it to them.

#unknown That's why l didn't say anything.
#unknown Look, there was just this one big pot of stew.
#unknown He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it.
#unknown What was l supposed to do, poison myself? Two hours, 1 8 minutes, you couldn't figure out a way to give it to him? He never left the room.
