#unknown ln here.
#unknown Hey! Hey! Hey! What about him? What about him? Hey.
#unknown Someone.
#unknown Help.
#unknown Assistance.
#unknown This man needs help.
#unknown This man pays my salary.
#unknown Fortypointtwothree pounds.
#unknown Are they back yet? Have you heard from anyone? lf Pinkman is gone l'm done.
#unknown Do you understand? l quit.
#unknown l just told you, 40.
#unknown 23 pounds.
#unknown Fortypointtwoone.
#unknown My brotherinlaw, he keeps talking about driving out to the factory farm.
#unknown And l have l have stalled him as long as l possibly can.
#unknown lt's really at the point now where he's gonna find someone else to take him there.
#unknown So l don't know if it's been made presentable yet.
#unknown But l should be the one to take him out there, right? Can you just run it up the chain of command then? Anything suspicious? Still no, walt.
#unknown Well, then should we go? Got some place to be? Because it's, like, the third time you asked me that.
#unknown No, l'm just curious what the next move is.
#unknown Our next three moves is sitting here and waiting.
#unknown This here's the job, buddy.
#unknown Ain't all supermodels and speedboats, you know.
#unknown Any cartel news these days? Seems like l'm always reading something or other in the paper.
#unknown Yeah, well, not a lot happening stateside.
#unknown Hearing rumblings about some big play down south.
#unknown Lots of bodies, apparently.
#unknown You know, even by cartel standards.
#unknown We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones.
#unknown So when we gonna talk about your face? l don't wanna get into it, okay? No, it's not okay.
#unknown My brotherinlaw shows up looking like Macho Camacho and he thinks we're not gonna discuss it? You know, one of my old buddies from Glynco had a gambling problem except his thing was scratch cards instead of blackjack.
#unknown Dumb Okie bastard had his car repo'd playing scratchandwins.
#unknown He's fine now, you know.
#unknown He got help and all.
#unknown But l know he got on a ride that was rough to get off of.
#unknown l'm just saying l'm here, you know.
#unknown lf you want to talk about it.
#unknown l don't want to talk about it, to you or to anyone else.
#unknown l'm done explaining myself.
#unknown Hey, you think he needs more blood? lt's in the refrigerator.
#unknown What, you? You want me to? Anegative, yes? Your blood type? l don't know, maybe.
#unknown Anegative, 25 years old seventy kilo, 1 80 centimeters.
#unknown You smoke, you drink, you puff, puff, puff.
#unknown But no disease, no condition.
#unknown No complication other than an allergy to.
#unknown Oh, wait, don't say.
#unknown Erythromycin.
#unknown But l have cefazolin here, so no problem.
#unknown How do you know all that? Jesus.
#unknown He thought of everything.
#unknown Onegative.
#unknown That's what he needs.
#unknown lt's time to go.
#unknown What about Mike? With this injury? No travel.
#unknown At least a week.
#unknown l'll send for him.
#unknown You need protection, Gustavo? l wouldn't have guessed.
#unknown Water and rest.
#unknown What happened to the plane? There are many good ways south.
#unknown But, unfortunately, only one way north.
#unknown Six miles to Texas.
#unknown l've got a man there who'll drive us the rest of the way.
#unknown l kind of liked the plane.
#unknown So you gonna make it? Six miles is pretty far.
#unknown l'll make it.
#unknown You did well down here.
#unknown And you also proved a point.
#unknown l think you can run the lab by yourself now.
#unknown Don't you? Let Mr.
#unknown White go.
#unknown Pay him off or fire him.
#unknown Don't kill him.
#unknown You know that won't work.
#unknown Then you got a problem.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown We're home.
#unknown Are you doing your homework? Yeah.
#unknown Well, dinner is in about 30.
#unknown Hey, sorry to call you at home but l think maybe you're not getting my messages.
#unknown That or you just don't feel like talking to me.
#unknown Anyway, why I've been calling is because that thing we discussed? Well, l've been thinking and l decided l can't do it.
#unknown That's probably not what you wanted to hear.
#unknown But hopefully you'll understand and if you want to talk more about it, that's fine.
#unknown So call me.
#unknown l'm around.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Come on in.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown First, l wanna tell you that l get it.
#unknown From what you've told me, this situation with walt's gambling sounds intense.
#unknown Yeah, it definitely was.
#unknown And continues to be.
#unknown So l would greatly appreciate it if you would just help me out here.
#unknown Well, l've thought long and hard about this and here's what l want to do.
#unknown So is Walt gonna be okay? Are you in contact with him? He's fine.
#unknown Good.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown He doesn't know about you offering? No.
#unknown Absolutely not.
#unknown And l mean to keep it that way, so.
#unknown Six hundred and seventeen thousand dollars written out to me.
#unknown What is this? l can't take your money.
#unknown And why is that? Because, at the end of the day paying my debt with illicit gambling winnings.
#unknown l don't know, it feels wrong.
#unknown "lt feels wrong"? To me it does.
#unknown l'm not judging you or Walt.
#unknown l'm just saying l feel uncomfortable with it.
#unknown Well, Ted, the whole reason we're in this mess is because you had me cooking your books.
#unknown So when did wrong suddenly become a problem for you? Now, hold on, that was a onetime measure in an honest attempt to protect my employees and save my dad's company.
#unknown lt might've been a mistake, but that's no reason to go out and make another.
#unknown No, Ted, this is the big mistake, right here.
#unknown You owe the federal government $61 7,000.
#unknown lf you do not pay them they will come after you and then they will come after me.
#unknown And if they audit my business, find out that Walt and l paid for it with close to a million dollars in untaxed gambling winnings we will go to prison, where you will already be.
#unknown Do you understand? l understand you're upset, but l think you're overstating things too.
#unknown No one's going to prison.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown How are you not following me here? Okay, fine, let's say l take your advice.
#unknown l pay the lRS.
#unknown Then what? Then you don't owe them.
#unknown Okay, but l still owe the bank, Skyler.
#unknown l'm still going to go bankrupt and lose my business and my home.
#unknown l still have to pull my girls out of school.
#unknown Just because l pay some stupid fine doesn't make my life any less ruined.
#unknown So if l'm understanding you correctly you're saying you can't take the money l gave you but you can take a larger amount.
#unknown No.
#unknown l'm just saying as much as l appreciate the gesture the money you gave me doesn't really change anything.
#unknown Because it's not enough? No, no, don't twist my words.
#unknown This isn't about amounts, this is about me doing the right thing.
#unknown Ted, are you blackmailing me? What? No.
#unknown Blackmailing? God.
#unknown l feel l'm not explaining things right.
#unknown l think you're explaining it fine.
#unknown l notice that this is for less than what l gave you, by the way.
#unknown That's the Mercedes.
#unknown l leased it before l knew where the money came from.
#unknown Now that you know, you will be returning it.
#unknown The leases are ironclad, so l have to see what's possible but, yeah, l'm gonna do my best.
#unknown And l will pay you back as soon as l can.
#unknown l don't want you to pay me, Ted.
#unknown l want you to pay them.
#unknown Try it again.
#unknown Write a new check.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Same amount.
#unknown This time, made payable What happened to us? Make it payable to the lnternal Revenue Service.
#unknown l can't.
#unknown You have to.
#unknown Actually, no l don't.
#unknown Write it.
#unknown Saul Goodman, please.
#unknown Tell him it's important.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown What have l done? Hello, Hector.
#unknown All of them, Hector.
#unknown Don Eladio.
#unknown Don Paco.
#unknown Cesar.
#unknown Renaldo.
#unknown Artuno.
#unknown Cisco and Luis.
#unknown Escalada.
#unknown All dead.
#unknown As is your grandson, Joaquin.
#unknown Do you know who killed Joaquin? Would you like to see? This young man.
#unknown Do you remember him? That young man shot Joaquin to death while l made my escape.
#unknown l believe you have met him before.
#unknown lt was just you and Joaquin.
#unknown He was the only family you had left.
#unknown Now the Salamanca name dies with you.
#unknown Will you look at me now? Look at me, Hector.
#unknown Look at me.
#unknown l really appreciate you doing this.
#unknown You guys must have your hands filled with the car wash and all.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown No worries.
#unknown Happy to do it.
#unknown Besides, it gives me a chance to see how you work a case.
#unknown lt's interesting.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Like watching weeds grow.
#unknown This job can be boring as hell.
#unknown Until it's not.
#unknown So.
#unknown Any more news on that thing in Mexico? No, same old, same old.
#unknown Bunch of animals clawing each other's eyes out over turf.
#unknown So you think all the victims were cartel members? Not in the loop enough to know.
#unknown Take a right on this street, will you? Right? But we're going to the chicken farm, that's straight ahead.
#unknown No, we're taking a little detour.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Yeah, there's this industrial laundry l wanna check out.
#unknown lt's not far.
#unknown Just, yeah, turn right here.
#unknown What? What laundry? What about it? lt's owned by this company, this Madrigal Electromotive.
#unknown lt's this big German conglomerate right into everything.
#unknown lt turns out it's the same company that owns Fring's chicken joints.
#unknown Sounds like a real shot in the dark there.
#unknown l mean, you said it yourself.
#unknown lf this Madrigal, is it? lf this is such a big conglomerate then, you know, they must own all kinds of businesses.
#unknown No, it just lt just sounds kind of thin.
#unknown Well, look at you.
#unknown You lose your hair, go on a couple stakeouts all of a sudden you're, what, Kojak? l'm just saying.
#unknown Now, the chicken farm, however, boy, that place seems ripe for some kind of clandestine activities.
#unknown l just don't want us to miss anything, you know? You wanna talk about clandestine activities? Madrigal Electromotive also owns a subsidiary that manufactures this stateoftheart airfiltration system.
#unknown And none other than Gale Boetticher took delivery of one of these systems.
#unknown A chemist who was in possession of handdrawn plans for a meth superlab and was visited by none other than Gus Fring just days before he was capped in the face, okay? This shit is starting to feel like Like Three Days Of The Condor, you know? Anyway, an industrial laundry would be one hell of a place to hide a meth lab.
#unknown There it is right up there.
#unknown Just turn in there.
#unknown Walt, slow down.
#unknown You gotta turn in there, Walt.
#unknown What are you doing? You missed it.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown lt looked like a dirt road.
#unknown l thought you meant further up.
#unknown Just Just bang a Uie over here.
#unknown Hits the spot.
#unknown Thanks, guys.
#unknown l said to Mom "ice cream," but she was like: "lt tastes the same and it's healthier.
#unknown " So sorry.
#unknown l tried.
#unknown Frozen yogurt does taste the same.
#unknown Tastes exactly the same.
#unknown l feel, like, sorry for your taste buds.
#unknown Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.
#unknown Hey, it's free food.
#unknown Free food always tastes good.
#unknown Free drinks even better.
#unknown Hey, hon.
#unknown Can you handle another visitor? Mr.
#unknown Magoo.
#unknown Yeah, sure.
#unknown Hey, watch out.
#unknown Don't run into any walls or anything.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hey, Dad.
#unknown Hey, son.
#unknown So how you feeling, Hank? lt feels like one of those cones they put on dogs so they don't lick their own balls.
#unknown Nice.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Stay classy.
#unknown Anyway, hanging in there.
#unknown Glad you stopped by.
#unknown Listen, l'm sorry about all this.
#unknown l mean, that guy just came out of nowhere.
#unknown Yeah, actually, he didn't.
#unknown l saw him coming a mile away.
#unknown Hey, just mark it down as a brain fart and be thankful no one got killed.
#unknown Well, l'll tell you one thing.
#unknown Your Hardy Boys routine is over.
#unknown No more asking him to drive you on stakeouts.
#unknown lt's too dangerous.
#unknown You hear me? l'll do it.
#unknown No, you won't.
#unknown No, Marie's right.
#unknown lt was a bit shortsighted of me.
#unknown That's why l caved.
#unknown Caved? Yeah, l broke down.
#unknown l ordered me a gimpmobile.
#unknown l wish you would stop calling it that.
#unknown What do you mean? Like a handivan with a lift? No, no, it's a regular Tahoe.
#unknown lt's got hand controls.
#unknown l ordered it.
#unknown Should be here in about a week.
#unknown l don't expect to be in it long but gotta get around on my own.
#unknown Stop being such a damn burden to everyone.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Car wash business.
#unknown Hey, it's me.
#unknown Can you talk? l can listen.
#unknown Fair enough.
#unknown He doesn't own a gun, at least not one that he bought legally.
#unknown Nor does his home security system have any panicbutton arrangement.
#unknown So way l see it, we're good to go.
#unknown lf this is still how you want to handle it.
#unknown Like l said, l don't want anyone hurt.
#unknown All l want is for him to write a check.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown lt's gonna be fine.
#unknown l've got my Ateam on it.
#unknown Can l help you? Yeah, thanks.
#unknown What? You just can't What's this about? l'll tell you what this is about.
#unknown This is about you and me doing our best to keep Huell happy.
#unknown Huell? Who's Huell? This is Huell.
#unknown Huell, you happy? Reasonably.
#unknown What would make you unhappy? This motherfucker not doing what he's told.
#unknown lf you were unhappy, Mr.
#unknown Beneke wouldn't care for that? l'm gonna say no.
#unknown Well, there you have it.
#unknown Let's go find your checkbook.
#unknown Ready? Here we go.
#unknown All right? We're walking, we're swinging our feet.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown Very nice.
#unknown Beautiful place you have here.
#unknown This way.
#unknown So the amount's gonna be for $61 7,226 l don't have that kind of money.
#unknown Hold that thought.
#unknown Forgot to mention we know exactly how much money is in your account, okay? Understand? You still want to say that stuff from before? Maybe not.
#unknown So $61 7,226 and 31 cents made payable to the lnternal Revenue Service.
#unknown What? Wait, this is? Skyler? Skyler white sent you? lt doesn't matter.
#unknown For now, all you have to do is worry about that.
#unknown My God, this is a misunderstanding.
#unknown Skyler is a dear friend of mine, all right? Let me call her.
#unknown We'll.
#unknown No, you're misunderstanding, Mr.
#unknown Beneke.
#unknown Phonecall time is over.
#unknown Checkwriting time.
#unknown Skyler would never do this to me.
#unknown Sit down and write! There you go.
#unknown Six hundred seventeen thousand, two hundred twentysix dollars and thirtyone.
#unknown Yeah, right.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Huell, you happy? Huell's happy.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Everything else has been filled out for you.
#unknown All's we need is a signature right there.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Hard part is over.
#unknown Here's what happens next.
#unknown Huell is gonna hang here with you.
#unknown l'm gonna make sure l get this down to UPS before 5:00.
#unknown Way back, l'm gonna grab some sandwiches.
#unknown The three of us can hang out and play cards or watch TV for the next couple of days until the check clears.
#unknown Painless, right? Unless you don't have cable in which case it's gonna suck, so.
#unknown Does the laundry have to be dirty? Nope.
#unknown Someone cooked here.
#unknown You've been out of commission four days.
#unknown You think we're gonna shut down the whole operation just for you? Who cooked? Who was here? l don't know how you're doing the flips.
#unknown Tell me.
#unknown Keep cool.
#unknown Oh, l'm gonna get you.
#unknown Oh, l'm gonna get you.
#unknown Jump.

#unknown He doesn't think you need me anymore.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse, if you agree to replace me he will kill me.
#unknown You brought your brotherinlaw to our lab.
#unknown what the hell is wrong with you? That's not my fault, Jesse.
#unknown Get off.
#unknown You've got to help me.
#unknown Please.
#unknown The last time l asked for your help, you said: "l hope you end up buried in a barrel in the Mexican desert.
#unknown " You are done.
#unknown Fired.
#unknown Do not show your face at the laundry again.
#unknown Stay away from Pinkman.
#unknown Do not go near him.
#unknown Ever.
#unknown Are you listening to me? Or else you'll do what? What did you say? Stay away from Pinkman or else you'll do what? Kill me? lf you could kill me l'd already be dead.
#unknown But you can't.
#unknown You can't kill me because Jesse wouldn't cook for you if you did.
#unknown That's it, isn't it? No matter how hard you try to turn him against me to screw with his head so that he would hate my guts and he still won't let you do it.
#unknown For now.
#unknown But he'll come around.
#unknown ln the meantime, there's the matter of your brotherinlaw.
#unknown He is a problem you promised to resolve.
#unknown You have failed.
#unknown Now it's left to me to deal with him.
#unknown You can't lf you try to interfere this becomes a much simpler matter.
#unknown l will kill your wife.
#unknown l will kill your son.
#unknown l will kill your infant daughter.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Perfect.
#unknown You know, this is just.
#unknown l told her you were my Ateam.
