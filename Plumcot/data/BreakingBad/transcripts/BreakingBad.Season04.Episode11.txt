skyler_white  We're home.
skyler_white  doing your homework?
walter_white_jr.  Yeah.
skyler_white  Well, dinner is in about 30.
ted_beneke  Hey, sorry to call you at home but l think maybe you're not getting my messages.
ted_beneke  That or you just don't feel like talking to me.
ted_beneke  Anyway, why I've been calling is because that thing we discussed?
ted_beneke  Well, l've been thinking and l decided l can't do it.
ted_beneke  That's probably not what you wanted to hear.
Ted_Beneke  But hopefully you'll understand and if you want to talk more about it, that's fine.
ted_beneke  Hey.
skyler_white  Come
ted_beneke  on in. Hi.
ted_beneke  First, l wanna tell you that l get it.
ted_beneke  what you've told me, this situation with walt's gambling sounds intense.
skyler_white  Yeah, it definitely was.
skyler_white  And continues to be
skyler_white  be. So l would greatly appreciate it if you would just help me out here.
ted_beneke  Well, l've thought long and hard about this and here's what l want to do.
ted_beneke  So is Walt gonna be okay? Are
ted_beneke  Are you in contact with him?
skyler_white  He's fine.
ted_beneke  Good.
ted_beneke  That's good.
ted_beneke  He doesn't know about you offering?
skyler_white  No.
skyler_white  Absolutely not.
skyler_white  And l mean to keep it that way, so.
skyler_white  Six hundred and seventeen thousand dollars written out to me.
skyler_white  What is this?
ted_beneke  l can't take your money.
skyler_white  And why is that
ted_beneke  Because, at the end of the day paying my debt with illicit gambling winnings. l don't know, it feels wrong.
skyler_white  lt feels wrong"
ted_beneke  To me it does.
ted_beneke  l'm not judging you or Walt.
ted_beneke  l'm just saying l feel uncomfortable with it
skyler_white  Well, Ted, the whole reason we're in this mess is because you had me cooking your books.
skyler_white  So when did wrong suddenly become a problem for you?
ted_beneke  Now, hold on, that was a onetime measure in an honest attempt to protect my employees and save my dad's company.
ted_beneke  lt might've been a mistake, but that's no reason to go out and make another.
skyler_white  No, Ted, this is the big mistake, right here.
skyler_white  You owe the federal government $61 7,000. lf
skyler_white  lf you do not pay them they will come after you and then they will come after me.
skyler_white  And if they audit my business, find out that Walt and l paid for it with close to a million dollars in untaxed gambling winnings we will go to prison,
skyler_white  where you will already be.
skyler_white  Do you understand?
ted_beneke  l understand you're upset, but l think you're overstating things too.
ted_beneke  No one's going to prison.
skyler_white  Oh, my God.
skyler_white  How are you not following me here?
ted_beneke  Okay, fine, let's say l take your advice.
ted_beneke  l pay the lRS.
ted_beneke  Then what?
skyler_white  Then you don't owe them.
ted_beneke  Okay, but l still owe the bank, Skyler.
ted_beneke  l'm still going to go bankrupt and lose my business and my home.
ted_beneke  l still have to pull my girls out of school.
ted_beneke  Just because l pay some stupid fine doesn't make my life any less ruined.
skyler_white  So if l'm understanding you correctly you're saying you can't take the money l gave you but you can take a larger amount.
ted_beneke  No.
ted_beneke  l'm just saying as much as l appreciate the gesture the money you gave me doesn't really change anything.
skyler_white  Because it's not enough? No
ted_beneke  no, don't twist my words.
ted_beneke  This isn't about amounts, this is about me doing the right thing.
skyler_white  Ted, are you blackmailing me?
ted_beneke  What? No
ted_beneke  No.
ted_beneke  Blackmailing?
ted_beneke  l feel l'm not explaining things right.
skyler_white  l think you're explaining it fine.
skyler_white  l notice that this is for less than what l gave you, by the way.
ted_beneke  That's the Mercedes.
ted_beneke  l leased it before l knew where the money came from.
skyler_white  Now that you know, you will be returning it.
ted_beneke  The leases are ironclad, so l have to see what's possible but, yeah, l'm gonna do my best.
ted_beneke  And l will pay you back as soon as l can. l
skyler_white  l don't want you to pay me, Ted.
skyler_white  l want you to pay them.
skyler_white  Write a new check
ted_beneke  Skyler.
skyler_white  Same amount.
skyler_white  This time, made payable What
ted_beneke  What happened to
skyler_white  to us? Make it payable to the lnternal Revenue Service.
ted_beneke  You have
skyler_white  to.
ted_beneke  Actually, no l don't. Write
skyler_white  Write it.

skyler_white  Tell him it's important.
unknown  Yeah. What have l done?

gustavo_fring  you know who killed Joaquin?
gustavo_fring  Would you like to see?
gustavo_fring  Do you remember him?
gustavo_fring  That young man shot Joaquin to death
gustavo_fring  while l made my escape.
gustavo_fring  l believe you have met him
gustavo_fring  before. lt was just you and Joaquin.
gustavo_fring  He was the only family you had left
gustavo_fring  Now the Salamanca name dies with you.

gustavo_fring  Look at me, Hector.
gustavo_fring  Look at me.

walter_white  lt's interesting.
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  Like watching weeds grow.
hank_schrader  This job can be boring as hell.
hank_schrader  Until it's not.
walter_white  So.
walter_white  Any more news on that thing in Mexico?
hank_schrader  No, same old,
hank_schrader  old. Bunch of animals clawing each other's eyes out over turf.
walter_white  So you think all the victims were cartel members?
hank_schrader  in the loop enough to know.
hank_schrader  Take a right on this street, will you? Right?
walter_white  going to the chicken farm, that's straight ahead.
hank_schrader  No, we're taking a little detour.
hank_schrader  All right. Yeah, there's this industrial laundry l wanna check out.
hank_schrader  lt's not far.
hank_schrader  yeah, turn right here
walter_white  laundry?
walter_white  What about
walter_white  about it
hank_schrader  lt's owned by this company, this Madrigal Electromotive. lt's
hank_schrader  lt's this big German conglomerate right into everything.
hank_schrader  turns out it's the same company that owns Fring's chicken joints.
walter_white  Sounds like a real shot in the dark there.
walter_white  l mean, you said it yourself.
walter_white  lf this Madrigal, is it
walter_white  lf this is such a big conglomerate then, you know, they must own all kinds of businesses.
walter_white  it just lt just sounds kind of thin.
hank_schrader  Well, look at you.
hank_schrader  You lose your hair, go on a couple stakeouts all of a sudden you're, what, Kojak?
walter_white  just saying
walter_white  Now, the chicken farm, however, boy, that place seems ripe for some kind of clandestine activities.
walter_white  l just don't want us to miss anything, you know
hank_schrader  wanna talk about clandestine activities?
hank_schrader  Madrigal Electromotive also owns a subsidiary that manufactures this stateoftheart airfiltration system. And
hank_schrader  And none other than Gale Boetticher took delivery of one of these systems.
hank_schrader  A chemist who was in possession of handdrawn plans for a meth superlab and was visited by none other than Gus Fring just days before he was capped in the face, okay?
hank_schrader  This shit is starting to feel like
hank_schrader  Like Three Days Of The Condor, you know?
hank_schrader  Anyway, an industrial laundry would be one hell of a place to hide a meth lab
hank_schrader  There it is right up there.
hank_schrader  Just turn in there
hank_schrader  Walt, slow down.
hank_schrader  You gotta turn in there, Walt.
hank_schrader  What are you doing? You
