#unknown And I asked him to leave, but he won't listen.
#unknown I just I I want him out.
#unknown I want him out of the house.
#unknown Okay, Mrs.
#unknown White.
#unknown There's a couple of questions I need to ask you right off of the bat.
#unknown It's very important that you answer them honestly.
#unknown Did he strike you? No.
#unknown Has he ever hit you? No.
#unknown This is not about violence.
#unknown This is about trespassing, about him being here against my will.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Trespassing.
#unknown You're divorced, then? No, working on it.
#unknown [stammering] Right now we're separated.
#unknown Legally separated? Well, there's not a court order, if that's what you mean, but we've been living apart for almost two weeks, give or take I changed the locks.
#unknown Isn't that breaking and entering? Whose name is on the title to the house? Both of us.
#unknown It's jointly owned.
#unknown We can't arrest a man for breaking into his own house, not without a court order requiring he stays away from the premises, unless he's threatened you or the kids in any way.
#unknown [baby fussing] No, not not physically, but having him in the house is just It's not a good thing.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown Don't cry.
#unknown Daddy's here.
#unknown I got her, honey.
#unknown Oh, come here.

#unknown No.
#unknown I'm fine right here.
#unknown I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.
#unknown If you want your husband out of the house, you're gonna have to help me out.
#unknown Is it possible maybe he's broken any laws that you know of? Anything at all.
#unknown Anything that we can work with here, just tell me.
#unknown Even if you've just got a suspicion of wrongdoing, I can work with that.
#unknown I'll get him out of the house for you.
#unknown [Officer] What's your take on all this? It It's my mom's fault.

#unknown Remember the other day when I brought up the idea of you getting back in touch with your, uh, partner? Well, I kind of wanted to refloat that boat.
#unknown I'm not suggesting that you yourself get back to cooking, I mean, you being in rehab and all.

#unknown It's the best thing for you and your family.
#unknown I can't.
#unknown I can't do it.
#unknown I don't want my son to find out that his father is a criminal.
#unknown I just I can't do that to him.

#unknown A week or two? Come on, man.
#unknown I'd be dying to get back in the action.
