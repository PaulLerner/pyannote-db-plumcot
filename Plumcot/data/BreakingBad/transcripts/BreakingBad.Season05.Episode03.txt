mike_ehrmantraut  It wasn't me.
mike_ehrmantraut  It wasn't a message.
mike_ehrmantraut  It wasn't payback.
mike_ehrmantraut  It was a mistake made by a third party who has since been dealt with. You
mike_ehrmantraut  Yeah.
dennis_markowski  Second
mike_ehrmantraut  Second thing.
mike_ehrmantraut  The deal you had with Fring, it's still in place.

mike_ehrmantraut  You got something to say?
dennis_markowski  Mike, I'm keeping my mouth

dennis_markowski  There's no way I could say I wasn't in on it.
dennis_markowski  I'm looking at eight years minimum.
dennis_markowski  I'm doing my time like I'm supposed to.
dennis_markowski  I'm no rat, and you
dennis_markowski  I mean, what else is there to say?
dennis_markowski  All due respect, what are we talking about here?
mike_ehrmantraut  The deal is the deal.
dennis_markowski  How's the deal the deal?
dennis_markowski  The feds took away my hazard pay.
dennis_markowski  My wife asks me where the mortgage is coming from.
dennis_markowski  I got nothing to tell her.
dennis_markowski  I knew the risks.
dennis_markowski  We all did.
dennis_markowski  that wasn't the deal.
dennis_markowski  And I know for a fact they got Holt and Perez yesterday.
dennis_markowski  Now, it's not gonna be me, but absent the hazard pay sooner or later, someone's gonna flip.
mike_ehrmantraut  No one's flipping.
mike_ehrmantraut  Everyone gets their hazard pay, including you.
dennis_markowski  I appreciate what you're saying and all, but the man is dead.
dennis_markowski  The
dennis_markowski  The lab's a hole in the
dennis_markowski  I just don't see it.
mike_ehrmantraut  I've got something new.
mike_ehrmantraut  It's just starting up.
mike_ehrmantraut  It's gonna make you whole.
dennis_markowski  Something new?
dennis_markowski  With the feds looking at you?
dennis_markowski  How?
mike_ehrmantraut  is my business.
mike_ehrmantraut  Hanging tight's your business.
mike_ehrmantraut  Your family's gonna be fine.
mike_ehrmantraut  You will be made whole.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, you got my word.
mike_ehrmantraut  You need more?
mike_ehrmantraut  No,
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm good. Who's next?
dan_wachsberger  That's your choice.
dan_wachsberger  D. 's got Martinez across town McGann's up in Sandoval. The
dan_wachsberger  The Sandia tribal cops are holding him for the feds.
dan_wachsberger  Holt and Perez are in lockup in Los Lunas.
dan_wachsberger  You don't mean to get to them all today? Yeah,
mike_ehrmantraut  I do.
walter_white  let's go! Open up! Back here.
walter_white  Oh, hi.
walter_white  How was your day?
skyler_white  Are you moving back in?
walter_white  I'll keep the condo for now.
walter_white  Selling it in this market, I'd get killed.
walter_white  But, yeah, I'm home
skyler_white  Do you really think that's a good idea?
saul_goodman  So you bring him here?
saul_goodman  on. The
saul_goodman  The three of us, we're the three amigos. All
saul_goodman  All for one, one for all.
saul_goodman  We don't need a fourth amigo.
walter_white  Saul, Mike knows the business.
walter_white  He knows distributors.
jesse_pinkman  Mike's okay.
saul_goodman  He's okay?
saul_goodman  He said he was gonna break my legs.
saul_goodman  And don't tell me he didn't mean it, okay?
saul_goodman  Because he gave me the dead mackerel eyes.
saul_goodman  He meant it.
walter_white  Saul, Mike threatened me.
walter_white  He threatened Jesse.
walter_white  He probably threatened someone before breakfast this morning.
walter_white  It's what he does.
walter_white  Come on
walter_white  Grow a pair.
saul_goodman  Let it be noted that I do this under duress.
walter_white  Duly noted.
saul_goodman  right.
saul_goodman  him in, Huell.
saul_goodman  Mike, I'm extending you
mike_ehrmantraut  Now that we're all together, here are the ground rules.
mike_ehrmantraut  Division of labour.
mike_ehrmantraut  I handle the business.
mike_ehrmantraut  Making the stuff, that's your end.
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't tell you how to mix your chemicals and whatnot and you do not tell me how to take care of business.
mike_ehrmantraut  Is that absolutely clear?
mike_ehrmantraut  All right.
mike_ehrmantraut  Let's take the tour.
saul_goodman  Hey, you're okay with that?
walter_white  He
walter_white  He handles the business, and I handle him.
saul_goodman  Clearly, we're talking about renting, not buying.
saul_goodman  You need an ongoing business, someplace you can slide in do your thing and remain anonymous.
saul_goodman  I'm not gonna mince words.
saul_goodman  This is your best bet.
saul_goodman  Got machines running, forklifts, people coming and going.
saul_goodman  You're gonna stay way under the radar.
saul_goodman  And the owner's solid.
saul_goodman  He can't wait to throw up a curtain wall stack some boxes in front of it, give you the space you need.
saul_goodman  After that, he's got his business, you've got yours and never the twain shall meet.
saul_goodman  It's outstanding. Am
saul_goodman  Am I right?
jesse_pinkman  Machines like this, gotta be plenty of power.
jesse_pinkman  about the smell?
saul_goodman  More good news.
saul_goodman  I've been here when it's up and running.
saul_goodman  This place stinks already.
saul_goodman  You'll blend right in.
mike_ehrmantraut  How many employees?
saul_goodman  I knew you'd ask.
saul_goodman  Sixteen illegals, all highly motivated to stay deaf, blind and dumb. You'll
saul_goodman  You'll want to vet them, I'm sure.
mike_ehrmantraut  Yes, indeed.
saul_goodman  So, what do you say, maestro?
saul_goodman  Is it unanimous?
walter_white  You know, I worked in a box factory one summer in high school and I haven't seen one of these in years.
saul_goodman  Trip down memory lane.
saul_goodman  That's perfect.
walter_white  You know what this is?
walter_white  It's a corrugator.
walter_white  It uses steam and salt to crimp kraft paper for cardboard.
saul_goodman  And it makes a hell of a racket doing it, which is great.
saul_goodman  Right?
walter_white  No.
walter_white  Steam and salt.
walter_white  When this thing is running, it's like a jungle in here.
jesse_pinkman  Shit.
jesse_pinkman  It'll ruin the product.
saul_goodman  You can't just pop down to Costco and get a couple dehumidifiers?
saul_goodman  What?
saul_goodman  Fine. Fine
saul_goodman  Fine.
saul_goodman  Moving on.
saul_goodman  Spacious, isolated location, no humidity and you get all the free tortillas you want.
saul_goodman  That's the special feature of this place.
jesse_pinkman  I
jesse_pinkman  I don't know. It'll make the tortillas smell like cat piss.
mike_ehrmantraut  Somebody's bound to notice that.
saul_goodman  All right
saul_goodman  right. Well, there's gotta be some kind of workaround, right?
saul_goodman  It's a technical problem.
saul_goodman  You guys are technical guys.
saul_goodman  You know, be creative.
saul_goodman  Put your heads together.
walter_white  Anything foodrelated is gonna have unannounced government inspections.
saul_goodman  I'm asking is that you keep an open mind
saul_goodman  mind. Danny's already set some space aside behind the SkeeBall games.
walter_white  No.
jesse_pinkman  Hell, no.
saul_goodman  I know it's a long shot.
saul_goodman  All I can say to recommend this is we're talking about an owner here who is, how should I put it, highly amenable.
saul_goodman  Look, I get it.
saul_goodman  Just say no and we'll go get dinner.
jesse_pinkman  So
jesse_pinkman  So I'll start.
jesse_pinkman  No way we're cooking in here.
jesse_pinkman  No space, nowhere for the smell to go.
jesse_pinkman  Look at that door.
jesse_pinkman  That thing rolls up and we're open to the world.
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't know if anybody noticed but there's a cop shop a quarter of a mile away.
mike_ehrmantraut  The hammer comes down, it's gonna be Custer's Last Stand.
walter_white  It's perfect.
mike_ehrmantraut  What?
jesse_pinkman  How are we gonna fit a lab in here?
walter_white  Who said here?
walter_white  A house is infested.
walter_white  Termites, cockroaches, whatever.
walter_white  Homeowners hire a pest control company.
walter_white  Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.
walter_white  The crew tents the house.
walter_white  They bomb the place with poison.
walter_white  The house stays like that for days.
walter_white  No one looks twice at a tented house.
walter_white  Now, maybe there's a strange smell coming out of it
walter_white  Does someone think to investigate?
walter_white  No.
walter_white  Does anyone go inside?
walter_white  that's where we'll cook.
walter_white  They tent, what, three, four houses a week?
walter_white  So we pick the one that's best for us.
walter_white  Enough floor space, easy access.
walter_white  Once the tent is up, we go in, we cook a batch we bomb the place and leave.
jesse_pinkman  So we gotta move in and out for every cook?
jesse_pinkman  Set up a lab, cook, and then take everything down
walter_white  challenging, but doable.
walter_white  Tell me about these guys.
saul_goodman  Mr. Ponytail on the sidewalk, that's Ira.
saul_goodman  He's the owner.
saul_goodman  On the roof is Sandor.
saul_goodman  The ladder's Fernando, and down below, that's Todd.
saul_goodman  The pest control operation is legit.
saul_goodman  I mean, they're licensed, they're bonded.
saul_goodman  They do as good a job as anyone in town.
saul_goodman  But they're also topdrawer secondstorey men.
walter_white  Secondstorey"
saul_goodman  B and E artists.
saul_goodman  They're burglars.
saul_goodman  I mean, hey, they play it smart.
saul_goodman  They don't boost anything while they're on the job.
saul_goodman  They copy the keys, locate the valuables and alarms and they sell that information to other crews.
saul_goodman  Or, after a decent interval they'll lift the goods themselves.
walter_white  And you know them how?
saul_goodman  I've been pulling their chestnuts out of the fire, legally speaking, for five years.
saul_goodman  Ira and his guys are good.
saul_goodman  I mean, they know how to keep their mouths shut.
saul_goodman  And if you buy them, they're gonna stay bought.
saul_goodman  You can check into them yourself.
mike_ehrmantraut  I will, if it comes to that.
mike_ehrmantraut  So do we take a vote? Why? We
badger  sound great.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  Rock on, man.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  Solid.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  That Yamaha's got a real nice touch. You
salesman_(hazard_pay)  You like the sound?
salesman_(hazard_pay)  It's huge,
skinny_pete  Yeah, it's real nice, but we're looking for something else today.
skinny_pete  You got any roadie cases?
salesman_(hazard_pay)  For sure.

badger  Biggest you got.
skinny_pete  That'll fit through, like, a regularsize doorway.

salesman_(hazard_pay)  Top of the line.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  Recessed hardware, foam lining, quarterinch laminated walls 3inch casters.
skinny_pete  Height is good, width is good.
skinny_pete  How much weight will this hold?
salesman_(hazard_pay)  It's rated for 900 pounds.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  So unless your band plays lead bricks, you should be okay.
skinny_pete  We're gonna need
skinny_pete  Hey, man, I'm trying to do business over here, bitch.
skinny_pete  Sorry.
skinny_pete  He's, like, overly enthusiastic.
skinny_pete  Anyway, I'm gonna need four of them.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  Four?
salesman_(hazard_pay)  That gonna be layaway? Because
salesman_(hazard_pay)  Because I need to see a bunch of IDs for that.
skinny_pete  No, man, cash.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  Okay.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  Hey, you know what?
salesman_(hazard_pay)  I'll throw in stencilling.
salesman_(hazard_pay)  What's your band called?
skinny_pete  Damn, brother.
skinny_pete  Not asking no questions, but it sure looks like you're back in business.
badger  No joke. You
badger  You way back in business, man.
badger  Look at this.
badger  stacking the benjies till the rubber band pops.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah,
skinny_pete  All's we're saying is we know you're major league now but if there's ever anything else you need from us Any
badger  Any way we can get in on this at all.
skinny_pete  Little stuff, big stuff We
badger  would be
jesse_pinkman  over it. You know, maybe someday.
badger  That's cool. I guess we better hit it then. Yeah
skinny_pete  Keep
skinny_pete  Keep on keeping on, brother.
mike_ehrmantraut  Okay, it is the same job as always.
mike_ehrmantraut  You go out, you inspect, you deal with the customers, regular drill.
mike_ehrmantraut  Everything's the same, except for one important detail.
todd_alquist  No stealing.
mike_ehrmantraut  No stealing.
mike_ehrmantraut  Not a toothpick, not the spare change between the couch cushions not the panties out of the hamper.
mike_ehrmantraut  Nothing.
mike_ehrmantraut  And I mean nothing.
mike_ehrmantraut  If you're out with your buddies and they ask if you got a hot tip on a B and E you tell them you got nada.
mike_ehrmantraut  You're out of the game.
mike_ehrmantraut  The bottom line is that these houses are out of bounds, now and forever.
mike_ehrmantraut  All
mike_ehrmantraut  From time to time, you're gonna see these two. Now,
mike_ehrmantraut  as far as you're concerned, they are ghosts.
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't see them.
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't hear them
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't say" good morning.
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't speak unless you're spoken to.
mike_ehrmantraut  On the other hand, if they tell you to jump you don't ask what for, you jump. Now,
mike_ehrmantraut  you need a name for them
Mike_Ehrmantraut  You call them" Yes, sir" and" No, sir"
mike_ehrmantraut  You got any problems, you come to me.
jesse_pinkman  Here's the deal.
jesse_pinkman  The finishing tank's a tight fit.
jesse_pinkman  And with this motor you've got on top The
walter_white  The agitation motor.
jesse_pinkman  agitation motor here on top, the tank's not gonna fit in the box.
jesse_pinkman  It's just
jesse_pinkman  It's just too tall.
jesse_pinkman  know, I thought we'd put a collar on the tank and carry the motor in separately, alongside the condenser.
jesse_pinkman  And on the day, we just kind of twist it into place you know, while we're setting up. Yeah.
walter_white  Yeah.
walter_white  That's good.
jesse_pinkman  That
walter_white  That will work.
walter_white  And Joe and his guys can build it,
jesse_pinkman  Yeah.
jesse_pinkman  You know, they're up for it.
jesse_pinkman  Joe already bought a TIG welder for the aluminium work.
jesse_pinkman  And, you know, I figure if they can pull off the magnet, they can handle this.
jesse_pinkman  Now, listen, about the smell
jesse_pinkman  About keeping it out of people's drapes and furniture and whatnot When
jesse_pinkman  When I was down in Mexico there was this big, big, plastic hospital tent they set up inside of the Oh

ira  Here you're acknowledging that you've removed all pets and plants from the house and that food has been removed or doublesealed in the bags we provided.
ira  This acknowledges you've removed or bagged any medicine, tobacco, pet food.
ira  Better make sure you got any medicine you might need. It's
homeowner_(hazard_pay)  It's already in the car.
ira  Okay
homeowner_(hazard_pay)  Okay. Holy crap.
homeowner_(hazard_pay)  How much poison are you using?
ira  It's not how much, it's getting it where it's needed.
ira  Those are your foggers.
ira  They disperse the fumigate into the structure where it'll eliminate any nymphs or larvae as well as the fullgrown blattodea.
ira  So do we have all your keys?
ira  Any extras on here you might wind up needing?
homeowner_(hazard_pay)  No, I'm good.
ira  Okay.
ira  This last one here acknowledges that you have been informed that you may not reenter the premises until it has cleared the postfumigation inspection.
homeowner_(hazard_pay)  So you're gonna get them all,
ira  We'll kill them dead.
ira  That's a guarantee.
todd_alquist  Sir?
walter_white  There's
todd_alquist  There's a nanny cam in the livingroom clock.
todd_alquist  disabled it. I
todd_alquist  I just
walter_white  thought you should know.
walter_white  I've gotta say seeing you with Andrea and that little boy
walter_white  It was nice.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah.
jesse_pinkman  It's good, right?
walter_white  Yeah.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah.
walter_white  And
walter_white  And the way she looks at you
jesse_pinkman  think?
walter_white  Oh,
walter_white  definitely. So is it moving in any particular direction?
jesse_pinkman  I don't know.
jesse_pinkman  Maybe.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah. You
jesse_pinkman  You know, sometimes I think you know if it feels right, then
walter_white  If it feels right, it feels right.
walter_white  Sometimes you just gotta listen to your gut.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, instant family.
jesse_pinkman  What more can you ask, right?
walter_white  Absolutely.
walter_white  the cards. Have you thought about what your plan is?
walter_white  You know, visÃ vis honesty?
jesse_pinkman  You mean how much she knows about this?
jesse_pinkman  She doesn't know anything.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, you know, she's not stupid.
jesse_pinkman  She knows I'm into something, but
jesse_pinkman  She could make a pretty good guess.
jesse_pinkman  But I never told her anything.
jesse_pinkman  I'm not gonna. Okay.
jesse_pinkman  I mean it.
walter_white  I know you do.
walter_white  Jesse, I can't pretend that this doesn't affect me.
walter_white  It does. But with
walter_white  everything that we've been through, the two of us this has to be your decision.
walter_white  I mean, you've earned that.
walter_white  Secrets create barriers between people.
walter_white  speaking from experience, believe me.
walter_white  All that you've done it's a par' : of you, and I mean, if you choose to spend the rest of your life with this person then you'll have to decide how much you'll share with her.
jesse_pinkman  Meaning what?
jesse_pinkman  Like everything?
jesse_pinkman  Like Gale?
walter_white  I'm just trying to say that I trust you and I know you'll make the right call. If
walter_white  loves you she'll understand.
marie_schrader  They're leaving streaks.
marie_schrader  This more ethniclooking one, he's doing a great job but the other one is going back and forth like he's scrubbing a wall.
marie_schrader  They have to go in circles or you're going to leave streaks.
marie_schrader  That's pretty basic, right?
marie_schrader  I don't mean to tell you your business.
marie_schrader  It's just It's simple quality control.
marie_schrader  I've got some good news. Guess what. What? No, really.
marie_schrader  I want you to
skyler_white  guess. Marie, I really
marie_schrader  Okay.
marie_schrader  Hank's back at work.
skyler_white  Yeah
marie_schrader  Sure
marie_schrader  Sure, they love him now, but where were they when he needed them
marie_schrader  Merkert and all the rest, they laughed him out of the office when he told them about that chicken man.
marie_schrader  As far as I'm concerned, too little too late.
marie_schrader  If it were me, I'd tell them all to go to hell.
marie_schrader  Do I sound bitter?
skyler_white  But it's what he wants, right?
marie_schrader  Yeah, it's doing him good.
marie_schrader  I mean, his PT is going gangbusters.
marie_schrader  He's hardly using his cane at all.
marie_schrader  And thank you for that, really.
marie_schrader  I mean, God knows where he'd be if we had to go through his health plan.
skyler_white  just glad he's feeling better.
marie_schrader  So, speaking of which, we have another big event coming up
marie_schrader  Have you thought about what you're gonna do?
marie_schrader  Walt's birthday.
marie_schrader  Whatever you need, I'm here.
skyler_white  Yeah.
skyler_white  I I don't think we're gonna do anything this year.
marie_schrader  are you talking about?
marie_schrader  Of course we're gonna do something.
marie_schrader  Skyler, he was diagnosed around his birthday, right?
marie_schrader  So it's been a whole year.
marie_schrader  Listen, I've had my problems with Walt.
marie_schrader  Why he wouldn't come to the house when we were all practically Whatever
marie_schrader  Whatever.
marie_schrader  Water under the bridge.
marie_schrader  But at this point, every year is precious.
marie_schrader  We are

marie_schrader  You don't smoke. You
marie_schrader  You haven't smoked since college.
marie_schrader  You can't be serious!
marie_schrader  With the baby and Walt?
marie_schrader  You're not smoking around the baby, are you?
marie_schrader  And you can't smoke here.
marie_schrader  There's gotta be some rule or regulation, I'm sure.
marie_schrader  You can't force your employees to breathe secondhand smoke.
marie_schrader  I know for a fact that that is illegal.
skyler_white  Marie, shut up.
marie_schrader  What
marie_schrader  I'm sorry please don't speak to me like that.
marie_schrader  I am simply saying Will
skyler_white  Will you shut up?

marie_schrader  In the bedroom.
marie_schrader  She's resting.
walter_white  Is everything okay?
walter_white  Breakdown?
walter_white  What does that mean? It means
marie_schrader  means I don't know what else to call it.
marie_schrader  I've never seen her like that,
walter_white  Well, what did she say when she was yelling?
marie_schrader  Nothing.
marie_schrader  She just yelled," Shut up, shut up," over and over again.
marie_schrader  you know she's smoking?
walter_white  Occasionally, maybe.
walter_white  It's not a regular thing.
walter_white  I just wish I had gotten your message.
marie_schrader  Messages, Walt.
marie_schrader  Plural.
marie_schrader  I probably called you five times.
marie_schrader  I'm not leaving here until I know what's got her so upset.
marie_schrader  you gambling again?
marie_schrader  Is that what this is?
marie_schrader  Please, God, tell me the cancer isn't back.
walter_white  No
walter_white  No. It's not the cancer.
marie_schrader  Well, something happened.
marie_schrader  I don't mean to point the finger, but this didn't just come out of nowhere.
marie_schrader  It's time to tell me the truth, Walt.
marie_schrader  All of it.
marie_schrader  I mean it.
walter_white  right.
walter_white  You heard about Ted Beneke?
walter_white  The accident? What accident?
walter_white  A couple weeks back, Ted took a fall, a bad one.
walter_white  He gave himself a concussion and fractured a couple vertebrae.
walter_white  still in the hospital.

walter_white  less than with Fring.
mike_ehrmantraut  Listen, Walter.

jesse_pinkman  Tomorrow.
walter_white  How are you feeling?
jesse_pinkman  Okay, I guess.
jesse_pinkman  it off with Andrea.
jesse_pinkman  I had to.
jesse_pinkman  She's gonna tell Brock. I'm still gonna take care of the rent and stuff.
jesse_pinkman  It's the right thing to do, but, you know
walter_white  I meant this.
walter_white  are you feeling about the money?
jesse_pinkman  You're looking at it wrong.
jesse_pinkman  we worked for Gus we were cooking This
jesse_pinkman  last batch was great, but we didn't even crack 50 pounds.
jesse_pinkman  maybe cleared less money, but we got a bigger piece of
jesse_pinkman  the pie. It's like you said, we're owners, not employees.
walter_white  been thinking about Victor.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah?
walter_white  this time I was sure that Gus did what he did to send me a message.
walter_white  Maybe there's another reason. Like what?
walter_white  Victor trying to cook that batch on his own
walter_white  Taking liberties that weren't his to take?
walter_white  Maybe he flew too close to the sun got
