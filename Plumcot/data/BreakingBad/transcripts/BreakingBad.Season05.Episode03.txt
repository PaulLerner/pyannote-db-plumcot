#unknown Hey, Darla.
#unknown How you doing today?  Hey, Dan.
#unknown I'm looking for something in a Markowski.
#unknown That'd be Dennis Markowski? That's the one.
#unknown Oh, and I've got my paralegal with me today.
#unknown Paralegal? Coming up in the world.
#unknown You know it.
#unknown Hey, Dennis.
#unknown Have a seat.
#unknown You hear about Chow?  Yeah, people say he skipped town.
#unknown He's dead.
#unknown It wasn't me.
#unknown It wasn't a message.
#unknown It wasn't payback.
#unknown It was a mistake made by a third party who has since been dealt with.
#unknown You got it?  Yeah.
#unknown Second thing.
#unknown The deal you had with Fring, it's still in place.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Don't "okay" me.
#unknown You got something to say? Mike, I'm keeping my mouth shut.
#unknown The laundry was right above the lab.
#unknown There's no way I could say I wasn't in on it.
#unknown I'm looking at eight years minimum.
#unknown But I'm doing my time like I'm supposed to.
#unknown I'm no rat, and you know it.
#unknown I mean, what else is there to say? All due respect, what are we talking about here? The deal is the deal.
#unknown How's the deal the deal? The feds took away my hazard pay.
#unknown My wife asks me where the mortgage is coming from.
#unknown I got nothing to tell her.
#unknown I knew the risks.
#unknown We all did.
#unknown But that wasn't the deal.
#unknown And I know for a fact they got Holt and Perez yesterday.
#unknown Now, it's not gonna be me, but absent the hazard pay  sooner or later, someone's gonna flip.
#unknown No one's flipping.
#unknown Everyone gets their hazard pay, including you.
#unknown I appreciate what you're saying and all, but the man is dead.
#unknown Okay? The lab's a hole in the ground.
#unknown I just don't see it.
#unknown I've got something new.
#unknown It's just starting up.
#unknown It's gonna make you whole.
#unknown Something new? With the feds looking at you?  How?  "How" is my business.
#unknown Hanging tight's your business.
#unknown Your family's gonna be fine.
#unknown You will be made whole.
#unknown Now, you got my word.
#unknown You need more? No, Mike.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown Who's next?  That's your choice.
#unknown A.
#unknown P.
#unknown D.
#unknown 's got Martinez across town McGann's up in Sandoval.
#unknown The Sandia tribal cops are holding him for the feds.
#unknown And Holt and Perez are in lockup in Los Lunas.
#unknown You don't mean to get to them all today? Yeah, I do.
#unknown Hey, let's go! Open up! Back here.
#unknown Oh, hi.
#unknown How was your day? Are you moving back in? Yeah.
#unknown I'll keep the condo for now.
#unknown Selling it in this market, I'd get killed.
#unknown But, yeah, I'm home.
#unknown It's time.
#unknown Do you really think that's a good idea? Yes.
#unknown So you bring him here? Come on.
#unknown The three of us, we're the three amigos.
#unknown All for one, one for all.
#unknown We don't need a fourth amigo.
#unknown Saul, Mike knows the business.
#unknown He knows distributors.
#unknown Mike's okay.
#unknown He's okay? He said he was gonna break my legs.
#unknown And don't tell me he didn't mean it, okay? Because he gave me the dead mackerel eyes.
#unknown He meant it.
#unknown Saul, Mike threatened me.
#unknown He threatened Jesse.
#unknown He probably threatened someone before breakfast this morning.
#unknown It's what he does.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Grow a pair.
#unknown Let it be noted that I do this under duress.
#unknown Duly noted.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let him in, Huell.
#unknown Mike, I'm extending you Now that we're all together, here are the ground rules.
#unknown Division of labour.
#unknown I handle the business.
#unknown Making the stuff, that's your end.
#unknown I don't tell you how to mix your chemicals and whatnot and you do not tell me how to take care of business.
#unknown Is that absolutely clear?  Sure.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let's take the tour.
#unknown Hey, you're okay with that? Yes.
#unknown He handles the business, and I handle him.
#unknown Clearly, we're talking about renting, not buying.
#unknown You need an ongoing business, someplace you can slide in do your thing and remain anonymous.
#unknown I'm not gonna mince words.
#unknown This is your best bet.
#unknown Got machines running, forklifts, people coming and going.
#unknown You're gonna stay way under the radar.
#unknown And the owner's solid.
#unknown He can't wait to throw up a curtain wall stack some boxes in front of it, give you the space you need.
#unknown After that, he's got his business, you've got yours and never the twain shall meet.
#unknown It's outstanding.
#unknown Am I right? Machines like this, gotta be plenty of power.
#unknown What about the smell? More good news.
#unknown I've been here when it's up and running.
#unknown This place stinks already.
#unknown You'll blend right in.
#unknown How many employees? I knew you'd ask.
#unknown Sixteen illegals, all highly motivated to stay deaf, blind and dumb.
#unknown You'll want to vet them, I'm sure.
#unknown Yes, indeed.
#unknown So, what do you say, maestro? Is it unanimous? You know, I worked in a box factory one summer in high school and I haven't seen one of these in years.
#unknown Trip down memory lane.
#unknown That's perfect.
#unknown You know what this is? It's a corrugator.
#unknown It uses steam and salt to crimp kraft paper for cardboard.
#unknown And it makes a hell of a racket doing it, which is great.
#unknown Right? No.
#unknown Steam and salt.
#unknown When this thing is running, it's like a jungle in here.
#unknown Shit.
#unknown It'll ruin the product.
#unknown You can't just pop down to Costco and get a couple dehumidifiers? What? Fine.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Moving on.
#unknown Spacious, isolated location, no humidity and you get all the free tortillas you want.
#unknown That's the special feature of this place.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown It'll make the tortillas smell like cat piss.
#unknown Somebody's bound to notice that.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Well, there's gotta be some kind of workaround, right? It's a technical problem.
#unknown You guys are technical guys.
#unknown You know, be creative.
#unknown Put your heads together.
#unknown Anything foodrelated is gonna have unannounced government inspections.
#unknown All I'm asking is that you keep an open mind.
#unknown Danny's already set some space aside behind the SkeeBall games.
#unknown No.
#unknown Hell, no.
#unknown I know it's a long shot.
#unknown All I can say to recommend this is we're talking about an owner here who is, how should I put it, highly amenable.
#unknown Look, I get it.
#unknown Just say no and we'll go get dinner.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So I'll start.
#unknown No way we're cooking in here.
#unknown No space, nowhere for the smell to go.
#unknown Look at that door.
#unknown That thing rolls up and we're open to the world.
#unknown I don't know if anybody noticed but there's a cop shop a quarter of a mile away.
#unknown The hammer comes down, it's gonna be Custer's Last Stand.
#unknown It's perfect.
#unknown What? How are we gonna fit a lab in here? Who said here? A house is infested.
#unknown Termites, cockroaches, whatever.
#unknown Homeowners hire a pest control company.
#unknown Truck rolls up, homeowners leave.
#unknown The crew tents the house.
#unknown They bomb the place with poison.
#unknown The house stays like that for days.
#unknown No one looks twice at a tented house.
#unknown Now, maybe there's a strange smell coming out of it.
#unknown Does someone think to investigate? No.
#unknown Does anyone go inside? Hell, no.
#unknown And that's where we'll cook.
#unknown They tent, what, three, four houses a week? So we pick the one that's best for us.
#unknown Enough floor space, easy access.
#unknown Once the tent is up, we go in, we cook a batch we bomb the place and leave.
#unknown So we gotta move in and out for every cook? Set up a lab, cook, and then take everything down? It's challenging, but doable.
#unknown Tell me about these guys.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Ponytail on the sidewalk, that's Ira.
#unknown He's the owner.
#unknown On the roof is Sandor.
#unknown The ladder's Fernando, and down below, that's Todd.
#unknown The pest control operation is legit.
#unknown I mean, they're licensed, they're bonded.
#unknown They do as good a job as anyone in town.
#unknown But they're also topdrawer secondstorey men.
#unknown "Secondstorey"?  B and E artists.
#unknown They're burglars.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I mean, hey, they play it smart.
#unknown They don't boost anything while they're on the job.
#unknown They copy the keys, locate the valuables and alarms and they sell that information to other crews.
#unknown Or, after a decent interval  they'll lift the goods themselves.
#unknown And you know them how? Oh, I've been pulling their chestnuts out of the fire, legally speaking, for five years.
#unknown Ira and his guys are good.
#unknown I mean, they know how to keep their mouths shut.
#unknown And if you buy them, they're gonna stay bought.
#unknown You can check into them yourself.
#unknown I will, if it comes to that.
#unknown So do we take a vote? Why?  We sound great.
#unknown Rock on, man.
#unknown Solid.
#unknown That Yamaha's got a real nice touch.
#unknown You like the sound? It's huge, huh? Yeah, it's real nice, but we're looking for something else today.
#unknown You got any roadie cases?  For sure.
#unknown What size? Biggest you got.
#unknown That'll fit through, like, a regularsize doorway.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Follow me.
#unknown Top of the line.
#unknown Recessed hardware, foam lining, quarterinch laminated walls 3inch casters.
#unknown Height is good, width is good.
#unknown How much weight will this hold? It's rated for 900 pounds.
#unknown So unless your band plays lead bricks, you should be okay.
#unknown We're gonna need Hey, man, I'm trying to do business over here, bitch.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown He's, like, overly enthusiastic.
#unknown Anyway, I'm gonna need four of them.
#unknown Four? That gonna be layaway? Because I need to see a bunch of IDs for that.
#unknown No, man, cash.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Hey, you know what? I'll throw in stencilling.
#unknown What's your band called? Damn, brother.
#unknown Not asking no questions, but it sure looks like you're back in business.
#unknown No joke.
#unknown You way back in business, man.
#unknown Look at this.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You're stacking the benjies till the rubber band pops.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown All's we're saying is we know you're major league now but if there's ever anything else you need from us Any way we can get in on this at all.
#unknown Little stuff, big stuff We would be all over it.
#unknown You know, maybe someday.
#unknown That's cool.
#unknown I guess we better hit it then.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Keep on keeping on, brother.
#unknown Later.
#unknown Okay, it is the same job as always.
#unknown You go out, you inspect, you deal with the customers, regular drill.
#unknown Everything's the same, except for one important detail.
#unknown No stealing.
#unknown No stealing.
#unknown Not a toothpick, not the spare change between the couch cushions not the panties out of the hamper.
#unknown Nothing.
#unknown And I mean nothing.
#unknown If you're out with your buddies and they ask if you got a hot tip on a B and E you tell them you got nada.
#unknown You're out of the game.
#unknown The bottom line is that these houses are out of bounds, now and forever.
#unknown Got it? All right.
#unknown From time to time, you're gonna see these two.
#unknown Now, as far as you're concerned, they are ghosts.
#unknown You don't see them.
#unknown You don't hear them.
#unknown You don't say "good morning.
#unknown " You don't speak unless you're spoken to.
#unknown On the other hand, if they tell you to jump you don't ask what for, you jump.
#unknown Now, you need a name for them? You call them "Yes, sir" and "No, sir".
#unknown You got any problems, you come to me.
#unknown Here's the deal.
#unknown The finishing tank's a tight fit.
#unknown And with this motor you've got on top  The agitation motor.
#unknown The agitation motor here on top, the tank's not gonna fit in the box.
#unknown It's just It's just too tall.
#unknown You know, I thought we'd put a collar on the tank and carry the motor in separately, alongside the condenser.
#unknown And on the day, we just kind of twist it into place you know, while we're setting up.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That will work.
#unknown And Joe and his guys can build it, right? Yeah.
#unknown You know, they're up for it.
#unknown Joe already bought a TIG welder for the aluminium work.
#unknown And, you know, I figure if they can pull off the magnet, they can handle this.
#unknown Now, listen, about the smell About keeping it out of people's drapes and furniture and whatnot When I was down in Mexico there was this big, big, plastic hospital tent they set up inside of the Oh, shit.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Oh, hi.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown We were just wrapping up.
#unknown This is my  Friend.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Nice to meet you.
#unknown You too.
#unknown This is Brock.
#unknown Hi, Brock.
#unknown I'm Walt.
#unknown I've heard a lot about you.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown I understand you were in the hospital.
#unknown And Jesse told me that you were very brave.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown A man of few words.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown He mostly just wants to play his game.
#unknown Oh, I know that.
#unknown I have two of my own.
#unknown A boy and a girl.
#unknown Well, I should go.
#unknown I was thinking I could make us all some dinner.
#unknown Are you sure you don't wanna? Yeah.
#unknown Why don't you stay for a beer at least? Sure.
#unknown Why not? A beer sounds good.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown How are you today, sir?  We're good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown How are you?  Family all packed up, ready to go?  Yeah.
#unknown Here you're acknowledging that you've removed all pets and plants from the house and that food has been removed or doublesealed in the bags we provided.
#unknown This acknowledges you've removed or bagged any medicine, tobacco, pet food.
#unknown Better make sure you got any medicine you might need.
#unknown It's already in the car.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Holy crap.
#unknown How much poison are you using? It's not how much, it's getting it where it's needed.
#unknown Those are your foggers.
#unknown They disperse the fumigate into the structure where it'll eliminate any nymphs or larvae as well as the fullgrown blattodea.
#unknown So do we have all your keys? Any extras on here you might wind up needing?  No, I'm good.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown This last one here acknowledges that you have been informed that you may not reenter the premises until it has cleared the postfumigation inspection.
#unknown So you're gonna get them all, right? We'll kill them dead.
#unknown That's a guarantee.
#unknown Sir? Sir? Yes? There's a nanny cam in the livingroom clock.
#unknown I disabled it.
#unknown I just thought you should know.
#unknown What's your name?  Todd, sir.
#unknown Cheers.
#unknown You know, I've gotta say seeing you with Andrea and that little boy It was nice.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's good, right?  Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown And the way she looks at you  You think?  Oh, definitely.
#unknown So is it moving in any particular direction? I don't know.
#unknown Maybe.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You know, sometimes I think you know if it feels right, then If it feels right, it feels right.
#unknown Sometimes you just gotta listen to your gut.
#unknown I mean, instant family.
#unknown What more can you ask, right? Absolutely.
#unknown Cut the cards.
#unknown Have you thought about what your plan is? You know, visÃ vis honesty? You mean how much she knows about this? She doesn't know anything.
#unknown I mean, you know, she's not stupid.
#unknown She knows I'm into something, but She could make a pretty good guess.
#unknown But I never told her anything.
#unknown I'm not gonna.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown I know you do.
#unknown Jesse, I can't pretend that this doesn't affect me.
#unknown It does.
#unknown But with everything that we've been through, the two of us this has to be your decision.
#unknown I mean, you've earned that.
#unknown Seriously? Yeah.
#unknown Secrets create barriers between people.
#unknown I'm speaking from experience, believe me.
#unknown All that you've done it's a par': of you, and I mean, if you choose to spend the rest of your life with this person then you'll have to decide how much you'll share with her.
#unknown Meaning what? Like everything? Like Gale? I'm just trying to say that I trust you and I know you'll make the right call.
#unknown If she loves you she'll understand.
#unknown They're leaving streaks.
#unknown This more ethniclooking one, he's doing a great job but the other one is going back and forth like he's scrubbing a wall.
#unknown They have to go in circles or you're going to leave streaks.
#unknown That's pretty basic, right? I don't mean to tell you your business.
#unknown It's just It's simple quality control.
#unknown So I've got some good news.
#unknown Guess what.
#unknown What? No, really.
#unknown I want you to guess.
#unknown Marie, I really  Okay.
#unknown Hank's back at work.
#unknown That's wonderful.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Sure, they love him now, but where were they when he needed them? Merkert and all the rest, they laughed him out of the office when he told them about that chicken man.
#unknown As far as I'm concerned, too little too late.
#unknown If it were me, I'd tell them all to go to hell.
#unknown Do I sound bitter? But it's what he wants, right? Yeah, it's doing him good.
#unknown I mean, his PT is going gangbusters.
#unknown He's hardly using his cane at all.
#unknown And thank you for that, really.
#unknown I mean, God knows where he'd be if we had to go through his health plan.
#unknown I'm just glad he's feeling better.
#unknown So, speaking of which, we have another big event coming up.
#unknown Have you thought about what you're gonna do? Walt's birthday.
#unknown Whatever you need, I'm here.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I I don't think we're gonna do anything this year.
#unknown What are you talking about? Of course we're gonna do something.
#unknown Skyler, he was diagnosed around his birthday, right? I So it's been a whole year.
#unknown Listen, I've had my problems with Walt.
#unknown Why he wouldn't come to the house when we were all practically Whatever.
#unknown Water under the bridge.
#unknown But at this point, every year is precious.
#unknown We are What are you doing? You don't smoke.
#unknown You haven't smoked since college.
#unknown You can't be serious! With the baby and Walt? You're not smoking around the baby, are you? And you can't smoke here.
#unknown There's gotta be some rule or regulation, I'm sure.
#unknown You can't force your employees to breathe secondhand smoke.
#unknown I know for a fact that that is illegal.
#unknown Marie, shut up.
#unknown What? I'm sorry please don't speak to me like that.
#unknown I am simply saying Will you shut up? Shut the hell up.
#unknown Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  Shut up! Shut up!  Please stop Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! That's 5.
#unknown 23.
#unknown Fivepointtwothree.
#unknown Last one.
#unknown Fivepointtwosix.
#unknown That comes to 49.
#unknown 27.
#unknown Good yield, right? That is an excellent yield.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Hey, Marie.
#unknown How you doing?  Where is Skyler?  In the bedroom.
#unknown She's resting.
#unknown Is everything okay?  Breakdown? What does that mean?  It means I don't know what else to call it.
#unknown But I've never seen her like that, ever.
#unknown Well, what did she say when she was yelling? Nothing.
#unknown She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up," over and over again.
#unknown Did you know she's smoking? Occasionally, maybe.
#unknown It's not a regular thing.
#unknown I just wish I had gotten your message.
#unknown Messages, Walt.
#unknown Plural.
#unknown I probably called you five times.
#unknown I'm not leaving here until I know what's got her so upset.
#unknown Are you gambling again? Is that what this is? Please, God, tell me the cancer isn't back.
#unknown No.
#unknown It's not the cancer.
#unknown Well, something happened.
#unknown I don't mean to point the finger, but this didn't just come out of nowhere.
#unknown It's time to tell me the truth, Walt.
#unknown All of it.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown You're right.
#unknown You heard about Ted Beneke? The accident? What accident? A couple weeks back, Ted took a fall, a bad one.
#unknown He gave himself a concussion and fractured a couple vertebrae.
#unknown He's still in the hospital.
#unknown He may never walk again.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown I didn't know.
#unknown I'm so sorry to hear that.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown But that couldn't explain Skyler's Yes.
#unknown Yes, it could.
#unknown You do know, right? You You must know.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown She was having an affair.
#unknown With Ted Beneke.
#unknown Listen.
#unknown It wasn't It wasn't ongoing or anything, and Skyler and I have been trying to put things back together.
#unknown And then the accident happened, and she got Marie, I'm begging you.
#unknown Please keep this to yourself.
#unknown I don't want Hank to think less of her.
#unknown Or me.
#unknown When did you? Was she? I'm gonna go.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown I'm sorr  No.
#unknown That looked nasty.
#unknown Hey, you okay? I'm good.
#unknown Really? Yeah.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown You wanna fuck with me? Okay.
#unknown You little cockroaches.
#unknown Dad, wait.
#unknown You wanna play games? Okay.
#unknown I play with you.
#unknown Come on  This is it.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Wait for it.
#unknown Ready?  Yo u wanna play rough? Okay!  Say hello to my little friend!  "Say hello to my little friend.
#unknown " Nice.
#unknown Just Hey, Mom, feeling better? Hey.
#unknown Hey, why don't you join us, if you feel up to it? We have popcorn.
#unknown I think there's some pizza left.
#unknown If you're up to it.
#unknown Yeah, Mom.
#unknown Join us.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Look.
#unknown Look.
#unknown You whores! Everyone dies in this movie, don%they? Okay.
#unknown For you and you and me.
#unknown Three hundred and sixtyseven thousand dollars each.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown After the dealers got their cut we should be looking at 1,379,560.
#unknown Mike, you're short.
#unknown You're almost 300,000 short.
#unknown You're forgetting about the mules.
#unknown They get a flat 20 percent.
#unknown The what?  The drivers.
#unknown They're the ones that take the product from us to the dealers.
#unknown And so transportation is worth 20 percent? They're taking a risk.
#unknown Two hundred and seventyfive thousand dollars' worth of risk? What did Gus pay his mules? Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.
#unknown He didn't need them.
#unknown He spent 20 years building his own distribution.
#unknown He had 16 refrigerator trucks running his product.
#unknown And do you know where they are now? Government impound.
#unknown You don't like paying 20 percent? Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.
#unknown Hey, hey.
#unknown There's still over a million bucks here, all right? That's for one cook.
#unknown And since you're putting on the green eyeshade my supplier and I came to an agreement.
#unknown The methylamine is free this time.
#unknown But brace yourself, because the next barrel is gonna cost big.
#unknown Can we continue, or you got any more burning questions? Okay, kid.
#unknown You fronted us 120 to get us going.
#unknown So that's 40 from him and me.
#unknown One hundred and twenty.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Thank you, Jesse.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Now, Ira gets 110 for our piece of the business and 25 per cook.
#unknown That is 45 from each of us.
#unknown Ira's guys get 10 each per cook.
#unknown Goodman's cut, 18,000 from each.
#unknown Legacy cost, $351,000.
#unknown That's 117,000 each.
#unknown "Legacy cost"? I got nine guys You don't know them, but they were part of the previous operation and they know a lot.
#unknown And right now, some of them are in jail and more will be soon.
#unknown The feds RICOed their hazard pay.
#unknown So we are gonna make them whole.
#unknown We are gonna make them whole? What is this "we"? These were Gus' employees, not ours.
#unknown They might have been Gus' employees, but they're my guys.
#unknown So, what are they doing to further our interests? The cops are looking at them very closely.
#unknown We don't want them furthering our interests.
#unknown So we are paying them, why? Because it's what you do.
#unknown It's what you do.
#unknown My guys are keeping their mouths shut.
#unknown We make them whole.
#unknown One hand washes the other.
#unknown It's as simple as that.
#unknown It sounds like a simple shakedown simple as that.
#unknown We're paying for their silence.
#unknown That's blackmail.
#unknown Business is my end.
#unknown This is business.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown This is your problem.
#unknown It should come out of your end.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Just take it out of mine.
#unknown All right? Go for it.
#unknown I don't care.
#unknown Just take it.
#unknown No.
#unknown Jesse, thank you but no.
#unknown I'll pay my share.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown Let me tell you something.
#unknown This is how it's gonna be from here on out.
#unknown My guys are an ongoing expenditure so you best get yourself comfortable with it.
#unknown A hundred and thirtyseven thousand.
#unknown That's less than with Fring.
#unknown Listen, Walter.
#unknown Just because you shot Jesse James don't make you Jesse James.
#unknown Tomorrow.
#unknown How are you feeling? Okay, I guess.
#unknown Broke it off with Andrea.
#unknown I had to.
#unknown She's gonna tell Brock.
#unknown I'm still gonna take care of the rent and stuff.
#unknown It's the right thing to do, but, you know  I meant this.
#unknown How are you feeling about the money? You're looking at it wrong.
#unknown When we worked for Gus we were cooking This last batch was great, but we didn't even crack 50 pounds.
#unknown We maybe cleared less money, but we got a bigger piece of the pie.
#unknown It's like you said, we're owners, not employees.
#unknown I've been thinking about Victor.
#unknown Yeah? Yeah.
#unknown All this time I was sure that Gus did what he did to send me a message.
#unknown Maybe there's another reason.
#unknown Like what? Victor trying to cook that batch on his own? Taking liberties that weren't his to take? Maybe he flew too close to the sun got his throat cut.
#unknown
