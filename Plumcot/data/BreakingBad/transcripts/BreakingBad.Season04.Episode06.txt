unknown  No, no, no!
walter_white  I I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the

skyler_white  Really
walter_white  Really?
walter_white  Jesus.
walter_white  shouldn't have let me sleep.
skyler_white  You needed it.
walter_white  Skyler, I don't entirely remember what happened last night.
walter_white  I mean, if I said something Did
skyler_white  Did you know this Gale Boetticher person?
walter_white  Skyler, I can't even focus. I don't
skyler_white  don't Gale Boetticher.
skyler_white  Did you know him? Ha. Oh,
walter_white  What?
walter_white  What exactly did I say last night?
skyler_white  Just enough.
skyler_white  Did you work together?
skyler_white  Who killed him?
skyler_white  Was it the people you work for?
walter_white  Definitely not.
skyler_white  Was it somebody who At some point might want to do the same to you?
walter_white  I seriously doubt it.
walter_white  Oh
walter_white  I think
skyler_white  Mm. I
walter_white  I know exactly what happened last
walter_white  night. I drank too much wine.
skyler_white  You told Hank that the man he was looking for might still be out there,
skyler_white  that it might not be this Mm. Boetticher after all.
skyler_white  And I was up all night wondering why you would say that to him.
walter_white  Because I was drunk, Skyler. No
skyler_white  No, but then But then I was remembering your black eye
skyler_white  Your, uh, business disagreement that you don't want to talk about.
walter_white  I don't want to talk about any of this ever
walter_white  ever.
walter_white  The firewall, all right?
walter_white  Church and state.
walter_white  That's how we need to approach this thing
skyler_white  And then I remembered the message you left me the other day when you said you loved me.
skyler_white  I heard that, I thought that maybe you I
skyler_white  I don't know That you were regretting what's happened between us,
skyler_white  and I get that
skyler_white  After last night
skyler_white  I think you're scared.
skyler_white  I think that message was some kind of goodbye. Oh, Skyler.
walter_white  I think
skyler_white  think last night was a cry for help.
walter_white  Oh,
walter_white  Cry for help.
skyler_white  I think some part of you wants Hank to catch you.
walter_white  That is just
walter_white  is That is it. Exactly,
walter_white  yes.
walter_white  You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.
skyler_white  If he caught you, at least this would all be over.

walter_white  Now I I understand myself.

skyler_white  the police. I do not say that lightly.
skyler_white  I know what it could do to this family.

walter_white  front door I don't want to hear about the police
skyler_white  police. You're not some hardened criminal, Walt.
skyler_white  You're in over your head. That's
skyler_white  That's what we tell them. That's the truth.
walter_white  That is not the truth.
skyler_white  Of course it is.
skyler_white  A schoolteacher, cancer, desperate for money?
walter_white  Okay, we're done here.

walter_white  Who are you talking to right now?
walter_white  Who is it you think you see?
walter_white  Do you know how much I make a year?
walter_white  I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it.
walter_white  Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going in to work?
walter_white  A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes bellyup,
walter_white  disappears.
walter_white  It ceases to exist without me

walter_white  You're welcome.
walter_white  So you're here.
walter_white  You're actually here?
jesse_pinkman  To work?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah
walter_white  Yeah,
walter_white  Come here
walter_white  All right, I need an update
jesse_pinkman  Update on what?
walter_white  An update on these little field trips that you've been taking with Mike.
jesse_pinkman  I told you already.
jesse_pinkman  We pick up money,
jesse_pinkman  check on things,
jesse_pinkman  stuff like that.
walter_white  And you're his bodyguard, right?
walter_white  But what
walter_white  That's what you said.
jesse_pinkman  I said I guarded him
jesse_pinkman  like backup, like a second set of eyes.
jesse_pinkman  Everybody needs backup, right?
walter_white  And this has to be you.
walter_white  It can't be I don't know. Tyrus or any of those couple dozen muscle heads that Gus has working for him?
walter_white  It has to be Jesse Pinkman.
walter_white  Why?
walter_white  is there, something about you that I don't know?
walter_white  you a former Navy SEAL?
walter_white  Do you have to have your hands registered as lethal weapons?
jesse_pinkman  Register this.
walter_white  All I'm saying is that do you not even question this?
walter_white  Do you really believe that you mean anything to these people?
walter_white  I'm not trying to be insulting.
walter_white  I'm just trying to make you see things clearly.
jesse_pinkman  I see they can't outright kill me, but they don't want me getting high.
jesse_pinkman  I see this thing probably started as Gus getting Mike to babysit me
jesse_pinkman  But you know what?
walter_white  I saved Mike from getting robbed, even killed, maybe.
jesse_pinkman  So maybe I'm not such a loser after all.
walter_white  if What if
walter_white  just a setup?
jesse_pinkman  What if
walter_white  if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real?
walter_white  I mean, think about it.
walter_white  Your first day out guarding Mike.
walter_white  He steps out for one second, and what happens?
walter_white  You immediately get robbed.
jesse_pinkman  You are such an asshole.
walter_white  Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.
walter_white  Like you said, Gus can't kill you because of me. He knows I won't stand for it
walter_white  He needs me, and he hates the fact that he needs me
walter_white  me, so what does he do
walter_white  He goes to work driving a wedge between you and me.
jesse_pinkman  You're an asshole. If you'd been there, you'd know it wasn't a setup. Wait
walter_white  Wait a minute.
walter_white  How long did those guys chase you? Huh
walter_white  Because the way you describe it, they gave up pretty damn easy.
walter_white  No, no. This This whole thing, all of this It's all about me.
walter_white  is it
jesse_pinkman  Yeah.

mike_ehrmantraut  which they did, literally.
mike_ehrmantraut  It was written on the bucket lid
mike_ehrmantraut  Ready to talk?"
mike_ehrmantraut  That, I believe, is the English translation.
mike_ehrmantraut  I know you're not really asking for advice,
mike_ehrmantraut  but let me hire 10, and
mike_ehrmantraut  and we hit them back, hit them hard,
mike_ehrmantraut  hit them where they live.

skyler_white  Did you
walter_white_jr.  you see what's in the driveway?
skyler_white  yeah,
skyler_white  So that's yours, huh?
walter_white_jr.  Yeah.
walter_white_jr.  Dad got it for me.
skyler_white  That was very nice of him
walter_white_jr.  I I know it looks like well, awesome, but it's super safe.
walter_white_jr.  Dad Dad made sure.
walter_white_jr.  And I promise to always go the speed limit or
walter_white_jr.  or below,
walter_white_jr.  way below.
walter_white_jr.  And it gets great gas mileage.

walter_white  Look, about that, it just
skyler_white  Did you get the car wash keys? Um, yes,
walter_white  yes.
walter_white  Skyler, I may have overstated things earlier, and I'm sorry to be so forward.
walter_white  But I I just I want you to know something.
walter_white  I want you to
walter_white  I need you to understand that you are safe.
walter_white  You, Junior,
walter_white  You are completely safe.
walter_white  Everything that I do Everything I do it to protect this family.
skyler_white  So buying that car, that was protecting your family?
walter_white  maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car, and And I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants.
skyler_white  It goes back tomorrow.
skyler_white  Skyler
walter_white  Skyler, it will crush him.
skyler_white  That car directly contradicts our story.
skyler_white  And if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting the story.
skyler_white  What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt?
skyler_white  What about Hank and Marie?
skyler_white  about the IRS?
skyler_white  What were you thinking, Walt?
walter_white  I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.
walter_white  I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
skyler_white  Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him, so thanks for that.
skyler_white  But you know what, Walt?
skyler_white  Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.
