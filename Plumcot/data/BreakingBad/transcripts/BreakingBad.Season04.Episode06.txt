#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad Are you in danger? This is it, right? Last stop? It's like you wanted.
#unknown The kid's a hero.
#unknown It's a story people would believe.
#unknown This is what we buy.
#unknown To clean cars and clean money.
#unknown Gale Boetticher he was a genius.
#unknown I'm not sure I agree.
#unknown What do you mean? This genius of yours maybe is still out there.
#unknown No, no, no! Hey.
#unknown Chhchh.
#unknown Uh, it It's me.
#unknown I I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids, and, uh I love you.
#unknown Uh, it It's me.
#unknown I I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids, and, uh Oh Mmm.
#unknown Ohh Morning.
#unknown Afternoon.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Really? Jesus.
#unknown You shouldn't have let me sleep.
#unknown You needed it.
#unknown Ohh Skyler, I don't entirely remember what happened last night.
#unknown I mean, if I said something Did you know this Gale Boetticher person? Skyler, I can't even focus.
#unknown I don't Gale Boetticher.
#unknown Did you know him? Ha.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown What? What exactly did I say last night? Just enough.
#unknown Did you work together? Who killed him? Was it the people you work for? Definitely not.
#unknown Was it somebody who At some point might want to do the same to you? I seriously doubt it.
#unknown No.
#unknown Ohh God.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown I think I know what happened last night, Walt.
#unknown Mm.
#unknown I know exactly what happened last night.
#unknown I drank too much wine.
#unknown You told Hank that the man he was looking for might still be out there, that it might not be this Mm.
#unknown Boetticher after all.
#unknown And I was up all night wondering why you would say that to him.
#unknown Because I was drunk, Skyler.
#unknown No, but then But then I was remembering your black eye Your, uh, business disagreement that you don't want to talk about.
#unknown I don't want to talk about any of this ever.
#unknown The firewall, all right? Church and state.
#unknown That's how we need to approach this thing.
#unknown And then I remembered the message you left me the other day when you said you loved me.
#unknown When I heard that, I thought that maybe you I don't know That you were regretting what's happened between us, and I get that.
#unknown After last night, I Walt, I think you're scared.
#unknown I think that message was some kind of goodbye.
#unknown Oh, Skyler.
#unknown I think last night was a cry for help.
#unknown Oh, Jesus.
#unknown Cry for help.
#unknown I think some part of you wants Hank to catch you.
#unknown Wow! That is just That is That is it.
#unknown Exactly, yes.
#unknown You're like Dr.
#unknown Joyce Brothers here.
#unknown God! If he caught you, at least this would all be over.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown That's a tremendous weight just lifted off of me.
#unknown Now I I understand myself.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown I've said it before.
#unknown If you are in danger, we go to the police.
#unknown Oh, no.
#unknown I don't want to hear about the police.
#unknown I do not say that lightly.
#unknown I know what it could do to this family.
#unknown But if it's the only real choice we have If it's either that Oh or your getting shot when you open your front door I don't want to hear about the police.
#unknown You're not some hardened criminal, Walt.
#unknown You're in over your head.
#unknown That's what we tell them.
#unknown That's the truth.
#unknown That is not the truth.
#unknown Of course it is.
#unknown A schoolteacher, cancer, desperate for money? Okay, we're done here.
#unknown Roped into working for Unable to even quit? You told me that yourself, Walt.
#unknown Jesus, what was I thinking? Walt, please.
#unknown Let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing and admit you're in danger.
#unknown Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it.
#unknown Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going in to work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes bellyup, disappears.
#unknown It ceases to exist without me.
#unknown No.
#unknown You clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in.
#unknown I am not in danger, Skyler.
#unknown I am the danger.
#unknown A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No.
#unknown I am the one who knocks.
#unknown Ohh Look, I was Skyler? Here we are.
#unknown Just like you left it.
#unknown And where is your pretty wife? She has other business to attend to.
#unknown Well, like I say to her, place is as is.
#unknown Understand? Yes, I understand.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown I don't want her coming back with more demands.
#unknown She She gave me hard time when we settled on price.
#unknown We're all on the same page, Bogdan.
#unknown So here's everything you need.
#unknown I keep very good files.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown So you are the boss now, huh? You think you're ready? Yes, I I think so.
#unknown Being boss is tough.
#unknown I know you think I was hard on you, but you'll learn.
#unknown Being in charge is not easy.
#unknown It takes hard work.
#unknown You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
#unknown Yeah? I don't know.
#unknown Not so much, maybe.
#unknown But maybe, when you are the boss, uh, you will just keep your feet up and relax.
#unknown Mm.
#unknown The real important thing, and not everyone knows this is, is to be tough.
#unknown A boss has to be tough.
#unknown Has to say no to people.
#unknown Has to make cashiers wipe down cars, even if they don't want to.
#unknown Can you be tough, Walter? I I'm sure you can handle.
#unknown And if not, you can always call your wife, huh? Always sticky.
#unknown No problem.
#unknown As is.
#unknown Who'd have thought that someday I would be handing these keys to you? Many years.
#unknown Almost forgot.
#unknown Bogdan.
#unknown As is.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown You okay there? Fine.
#unknown It's night.
#unknown I'm not using.
#unknown Eat something.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown Both of them.
#unknown Uh I'm on my way.
#unknown You need any help? No.
#unknown You want me to call her back? No.
#unknown No.
#unknown But what exactly did she say? Uh, exactly.
#unknown Just, you know, she asked if I was okay and not to worry.
#unknown Like that.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Any, uh, rough timetable on this thing, or as to when she's coming home? Uh, it's It's about the gambling, right? Well, it's It's kind of hard to She She can't understand.
#unknown It It It's not like you're doing this on purpose.
#unknown You can't help it.
#unknown It's no that simple.
#unknown Look, you have a disease.
#unknown It It's like you're an alcoholic, right? No, it's not.
#unknown Not at all.
#unknown Yes, it is.
#unknown I read online.
#unknown She's not even allowed to be mad at you, and she can't be mad at you about the cancer, can she? No, son, these are two very different things.
#unknown Not really.
#unknown Gambling addiction is a sickness.
#unknown You c  Listen.
#unknown What is going on with me is not about some disease.
#unknown It's about choices Choices that I have made, choices I stand by.
#unknown You're not moving back in, are you? No.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown You know what? School can wait.
#unknown Why don't we take a little detour? What kind of detour? You'll see.
#unknown I think it's time we got you your own car.
#unknown What do you think? What? I I think if you're going to buy me off buy me off.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown It's amazing.
#unknown It's amazing.
#unknown Ah, it's goodlooking.
#unknown I'm glad you like it.
#unknown I I do, Thank you, Dad.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You're welcome.
#unknown So you're here.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You're actually here? To work? Yeah, man.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown All right, I need an update.
#unknown Update on what? An update on these little field trips that you've been taking with Mike.
#unknown I told you already.
#unknown We pick up money, check on things, stuff like that.
#unknown And you're his bodyguard, right? But what? That's what you said.
#unknown I said I guarded him, like backup, like a second set of eyes.
#unknown Everybody needs backup, right? And this has to be you.
#unknown It can't be I don't know.
#unknown Tyrus or any of those couple dozen muscle heads that Gus has working for him? It has to be Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown Why? What is there, something about you that I don't know? Are you a former Navy SEAL? Do you have to have your hands registered as lethal weapons? Register this.
#unknown All I'm saying is that do you not even question this? Do you really believe that you mean anything to these people? And I'm not trying to be insulting.
#unknown I'm just trying to make you see things clearly.
#unknown I see they can't outright kill me, but they don't want me getting high.
#unknown I see this thing probably started as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.
#unknown But you know what? I saved Mike from getting robbed, even killed, maybe.
#unknown So maybe I'm not such a loser after all.
#unknown I mean, what if it Oh, God.
#unknown I mean, what if What if it's all just a setup?  What?  What if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real? I mean, think about it.
#unknown Your first day out guarding Mike.
#unknown He steps out for one second, and what happens? You immediately get robbed.
#unknown You are such an asshole.
#unknown Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.
#unknown Like you said, Gus can't kill you because of me.
#unknown He knows I won't stand for it.
#unknown He needs me, and he hates the fact that he needs me, so what does he do? He goes to work driving a wedge between you and me.
#unknown You're an asshole.
#unknown If you'd been there, you'd know it wasn't a setup.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown How long did those guys chase you? Huh? Because the way you describe it, they gave up pretty damn easy.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown This This whole thing, all of this It's all about me.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown Uh, who is it? Hang on.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'll be right up.
#unknown What? I got to go.

#unknown So what's the plan? I just told you.
#unknown We sit here and watch that house until one of our entrepreneurs pops his head out.
#unknown Then we ask a few questions and get our property back.

#unknown He does.
#unknown Give us a minute, will you? We won't be too long.
#unknown The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo to a couple of local nobodies.
#unknown Very disciplined, though, not keeping anything for themselves.
#unknown It was all about sending a message, which they did, literally.
#unknown It was written on the bucket lid.
#unknown "Ready to talk?" That, I believe, is the English translation.
#unknown I know you're not really asking for advice, but let me hire 10, and we hit them back, hit them hard, hit them where they live.
#unknown No.
#unknown This war stays cold for now.
#unknown What about their message? What's the answer? Set up a meeting.
#unknown Let's see what they have to say.
#unknown How did he do today? I hear you can handle yourself.
#unknown I guess.
#unknown Good night.
#unknown Uh, excuse me.
#unknown Why me? I like to think I see things in people.
#unknown Slow down.
#unknown The car is not going anywhere.
#unknown Mom.
#unknown Hey, sweetheart.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Whoo.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown Did you see what's in the driveway? Uh, yeah, I saw.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown So that's yours, huh? Yeah.
#unknown Dad got it for me.
#unknown That was very nice of him.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I I know it looks like well, awesome, but it's super safe.
#unknown Dad Dad made sure.
#unknown And I promise to always go the speed limit or below, way below.
#unknown And it gets great gas mileage.
#unknown So Dad said I can take it around the block a few times.
#unknown That okay? Just around the block.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Just around the block.
#unknown And be careful, okay? I will.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown IIt It's really It's really great to have you home, Mom.
#unknown Hey, seriously, be careful, okay? I will.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I guess we should talk.
#unknown Oh, I think you said plenty the other day.
#unknown No.
#unknown Look, about that, it just Did you get the car wash keys? Um, yes, yes.
#unknown Skyler, I may have overstated things earlier, and I'm sorry to be so forward.
#unknown But I I just I want you to know something.
#unknown I want you to I need you to understand that you are safe.
#unknown You, Junior, Holly You are completely safe.
#unknown Everything that I do Everything I do it to protect this family.
#unknown So buying that car, that was protecting your family? Okay.
#unknown I, uh All right, maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car, and And I'm his father, and I should be able to get what he wants.
#unknown It goes back tomorrow.
#unknown Skyler, it will crush him.
#unknown That car directly contradicts our story.
#unknown And if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting the story.
#unknown What do you think the neighbors are going to say, Walt? What about Hank and Marie? How about the IRS? What were you thinking, Walt? I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.
#unknown Look.
#unknown I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
#unknown Oh, he will.
#unknown Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him, so thanks for that.
#unknown But you know what, Walt? Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.
#unknown
