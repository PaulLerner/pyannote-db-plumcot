#unknown Free is good.
#unknown Even if I was, like, rich, free is always good.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown New Hampshire.
#unknown You're a long way from home.
#unknown How long a drive is that? About 30 hours, if all you stop for is gas.
#unknown You headed to California? No.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So, what's here? Business.
#unknown You know, I was in Boston once.
#unknown Boston and a little town called Swampscott which is right outside of Boston.
#unknown That's kind of near New Hampshire, right? Yeah.
#unknown More or less.
#unknown Yeah, I was maybe 6, so I don't really remember it.
#unknown I want to say I liked it.
#unknown They got this really big aquarium.

#unknown They haven't said it on TV yet but Uncle Hank says he was this major, major drug dealer.
#unknown I mean, like, holy shit.
#unknown Your uncle is safe, right? How do they know that? Uncle Hank was after this guy all along.
#unknown He didn't tell us, but he was.
#unknown He even took me to his restaurant one time just, like, totally toying with the guy just like, "I got my eye on you.
#unknown " Like that.
#unknown They figure Mr.
#unknown Fring was the one who put the hit out on Uncle Hank.
#unknown Just somebody got to him first.
#unknown Yeah, wow.
#unknown Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.
#unknown She didn't want us to leave, but Mom figured it was time.
#unknown There's still some agents over there, but they figure it's over.
#unknown Like, when this hits the news Uncle Hank is gonna be a hero.

#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Oh, shit.
#unknown Jesus, just say it already.
#unknown Tell me "I told you so.
#unknown " Get it out of your system before you need, like, dialysis or something.
#unknown It's exactly like Boetticher's drawings.
#unknown Where were the two bodies? Over by the freight elevator.
#unknown Over there.
#unknown No idea who they were?  No, not much left.
#unknown Apparently the teeth do this popcorn thing when they get too hot so they tell me.
#unknown Whoever torched it did it up right.
#unknown Fring, you magnificent bastard.
#unknown What do you figure that was? I don't know, some kind of lab equipment? Maybe a camera? Come on.
#unknown Come on, you, be nice.
#unknown Be nice.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey! You be nice.
#unknown Just be nice.
#unknown Let Wendell in there.
#unknown If Wendell doesn't eat, nobody eats.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's Gustavo.
#unknown He's dead.
#unknown Son of a bitch.
#unknown Son of a bitch.
#unknown Hold up! Hold up!  Get out of my way, kid.
#unknown Wait a minute, all right? Let him talk.
#unknown I am done listening to this asshole talk.
#unknown Now get out of my way.
#unknown He's got something you need to hear, all right? What'd you do, Jesse? Do you even know? Do you even know what you've done?  Yeah, he saved his own life  One more word.
#unknown Mike.
#unknown Mike.
#unknown If you kill him, you're gonna have to kill me.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Oh, Jesse.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown What is it with you guys? Honest to God.
#unknown May I? Look, whatever differences you and I have, they'll keep.
#unknown Right now we've got bigger fish to fry.
#unknown Bigger fish.
#unknown The video cameras.
#unknown Gus kept cameras on us at the lab at the laundry, God only knows where else.
#unknown And of course, when I say "us," I'm including you.
#unknown Mike.
#unknown Mike, if he taped all that shit us cooking, you picking up If Gus had a record of that and the police get to it before we do You son of a bitch.
#unknown Mike, it's all on tape somewhere, or a hard drive.
#unknown Where? Where did he keep it? He had a laptop in his office.
#unknown Kept it in the back of the restaurant.
#unknown It all fed straight to there.
#unknown What? Keys, scumbag.
#unknown It's the universal symbol for keys.
#unknown Meter fraud.
#unknown And yes, yes, it's a big deal.
#unknown Guy rigs his meter so he's paying 2 cents less for firstclass postage.
#unknown I'm here to tell you that the USPS takes that very seriously.
#unknown It's money out of your pocket, it's money out of my pocket.
#unknown I was hoping Now, look, sarge.
#unknown Do you think we could work together on this thing? You folks have it over there? Could you tell me that, at least? Yeah.
#unknown Well, thanks for your help.
#unknown Inspector Clark Inspector Dave Clark, like the Dave Clark Five? Before your time.
#unknown Well, you feel free to call me day or night at this number.
#unknown Yes, sir.
#unknown No, you as well.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown We're boned.
#unknown Well You know how they say "it's been a pleasure"? It hasn't.
#unknown Are you gonna tell us about the laptop?  Where you going?  I'm getting the hell out of Dodge, kid.
#unknown And so should you.
#unknown It's just a matter of time.
#unknown Mike, where is the laptop? What the hell difference does it make? They got it.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown A.
#unknown P.
#unknown D.
#unknown , Northwest Area Command on Second.
#unknown They tagged it, they filed it it's in the system, and they locked it in their evidence room.
#unknown All right.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So describe the building.
#unknown Describe the How about I describe Fort Knox? And what are you gonna do? Are you gonna put on your black leotard and go dangling on a clothesline? It's a building full of cops.
#unknown What else do you need to know? And why in the hell am I talking to you? Mike, we gotta do something.
#unknown I am doing something.
#unknown He's good with this stuff, okay? Just give him a chance.
#unknown Now, you look.
#unknown That laptop might as well be on the moon.
#unknown They build these evidence rooms like bank vaults because guess what lunatics like you wanna break into them.
#unknown But unlike a bank vault, this is a place that is guarded 24 hours a day by the police.
#unknown There's no way you're getting it out of there.
#unknown Who said that we have to get it out of there? We just need to destroy what's on it.
#unknown Oh, so now you wanna blow up a police station? I don't believe I said that, no.
#unknown Nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite.
#unknown Now you wanna kill a bunch of cops.
#unknown I never said anything about killing anybody.
#unknown I am, however, considering the possibility of a device.
#unknown A device.
#unknown Yes, a small device.
#unknown Say this device gets filed into evidence.
#unknown Now it is inside that room.
#unknown What about a magnet? You wanna commit a whole other crime just to get this bomb into evidence.
#unknown Who said "bomb"? I said "a device.
#unknown "  What about a magnet? An incendiary device.
#unknown One quick fire is all it would take.
#unknown You don't think they have fire suppression? I'm not talking sprinklers.
#unknown I'm talking about halon.
#unknown Because halon doesn't destroy evidence.
#unknown A magnet, though, maybe like  A bomb then.
#unknown We plant a bomb outside.
#unknown Oh, actually I knew a crew out of Fort Worth that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside.
#unknown About all they did was take out a couple of hedges.
#unknown You are probably talking about 2 feet of reinforced concrete.
#unknown Or what about a magnet? What magnet? What about it? You know, just: So, what do you think? Expensive.
#unknown Leaving aside engineering rigging some kind of alternate power source my primary sticking point is I actually need the thing.
#unknown As you gentlemen can see, it's paying the bills.
#unknown But I mean it's feasible, doable? Hey, we're living in a time of string theories and God particles.
#unknown Feasible, doable? Yeah, sure, why not? Expensive.
#unknown What would you put it in? What about that? Does it run? We can get it running.
#unknown What's the box made of? Plywood and aluminium, just what you need.
#unknown All right, so you wanna talk money? Step into my office.
#unknown Hey, listen.
#unknown I don't actually have any money right now.
#unknown My wife There's an IRS issue.
#unknown Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could spot me my share.
#unknown I'll pay you back.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Whatever.
#unknown Right.
#unknown You coming? If you have any brains, you'll take that money you saved and you'll skip town.
#unknown Today.
#unknown Right now.
#unknown You don't think this can work? Is that a serious question? Mike, this is a threeman job.
#unknown The only way I know it won't work for sure is if we don't have you.
#unknown Come in.
#unknown Get in.
#unknown Close the door.
#unknown What did we say about you coming here? Yeah, speaking of things that tend to rile you up the police, they may call.
#unknown Let me back up a little.
#unknown Can I sit down? I'm gonna sit down.
#unknown Okay, why are the police gonna call? May call you.
#unknown Distant, outside possibility.
#unknown But on the off chance, I want you thinking one thought: Hogan's Heroes.
#unknown Sergeant Schultz.
#unknown You remember Sergeant Schultz? "I know nothing.
#unknown I see nothing.
#unknown " You remember how he I want you like that.
#unknown Okay, Saul, why are the police  There was an incident with Beneke Oh, God.
#unknown And it's  Oh, Jesus.
#unknown What incident?  An act of God.
#unknown There's no right.
#unknown There's no wrong.
#unknown I mean, it just That's the best phrase.
#unknown It fits, but we got a problem.
#unknown Ted's dead.
#unknown Sorry? Ted is dead? No.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown He just woke up.
#unknown Righto, that should do her.
#unknown All right, watches off.
#unknown Necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets Gold.
#unknown These are nonferrous.
#unknown Better hope.
#unknown What about that stuff you young guys wear on the end of your pricks? Speak now or forever sing soprano.
#unknown What's up with that, by the way? Why would anybody wanna put a metal ring through the end of their prick? What are you looking at me for? All right, guns, knives tools, keys, plates in your head artificial hips.
#unknown Check your pockets for me one more time, please.
#unknown Oh, credit cards.
#unknown You want that plastic working come Miller time.
#unknown You know, I can foresee a lot of possible outcomes to this thing and not a single one of them involves Miller time.
#unknown P.
#unknown M.
#unknown A.
#unknown Positive mental attitude.
#unknown Okay, I think we're good to go.
#unknown All right, where do you want me with this? Start 40 feet out.
#unknown That's more than the length of the room.
#unknown Who's doing the honours?  Me.
#unknown Flip that switch, turns it on.
#unknown Twist this here.
#unknown That's your power control.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Everybody ready?  Yeah.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Fire in the hole! All right, you ready? Fingers crossed it don't yank the drive shaft through the floor.
#unknown Anything? Nope.
#unknown It's still working.
#unknown All right, start walking forward slowly.
#unknown Wait, wait, wait.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That did it.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yeah, bitch! Magnets! How many batteries is this? That there's 21, wired in series, so 21 times 12.
#unknown Two hundred fiftytwo volts.
#unknown Can you add 21 more, wired in parallel? UP the amperage? Everything goes flying in that evidence room it's gonna make one hell of a noise, and there goes your element of surprise.
#unknown Won't matter.
#unknown Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Who are you looking for? Ted Beneke.
#unknown I'm a friend of his.
#unknown But if it's not a good time, I could No, no, no, this is fine.
#unknown I'm just finishing up.
#unknown Come on in.
#unknown Hey, Ted.
#unknown I tell you, he's been a real champ.
#unknown His colour's better and his blood pressure's up.
#unknown We are gonna have you eating solid food in a day or two I bet you money.
#unknown That's wonderful.
#unknown All right, I'm just down the hall.
#unknown Ted.
#unknown Can you hear me? Yes.
#unknown Ted, I just I don't even know Skyler.
#unknown I haven't said anything to anyone.
#unknown I told them it was an accident.
#unknown I tripped and fell.
#unknown That is all they know.
#unknown Just I've I've got children.
#unknown Family.
#unknown I swear to you.
#unknown Please.
#unknown I just I will never breathe one word of this.
#unknown Good.
#unknown It should be about a quarter of the way down on the left.
#unknown We'll do a loop and come around the other side.
#unknown Turn here.
#unknown Right up there.
#unknown That's the wall.
#unknown What the hell is this? There's some bigass hump in the way.
#unknown So? Just drive over it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Come on, you can do it.
#unknown Take it easy.
#unknown Take it easy.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Cut it.
#unknown It's, like, 8 feet away.
#unknown Is this cool? Is this close enough? It'll work.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, let's go.
#unknown Hold on.
#unknown Let's just go!  Hang on.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, let's get out of here.
#unknown Just one minute.
#unknown Turn it off! Turn it off.
#unknown I will.
#unknown Jacocks! Jacocks, you okay? Outside! Outside! Yeah, bitch!  Shut up.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown And what exactly are you celebrating? You left the truck behind.
#unknown So what?  "So what"? So what if they find prints? And what if they trace it back to the wrecking yard? They won't.
#unknown There's no prints, I made sure of that.
#unknown There's no paperwork on the truck, the magnet or the batteries.
#unknown Untraceable salvage, all of it.
#unknown I made sure of that too.
#unknown Well, you got all the answers.
#unknown So you tell me, Answer Man, did all that even work just now? Yes.
#unknown It worked.
#unknown And I'm supposed to take that on faith? Yeah? And why? How do we know? Because I say so.
#unknown Gutierrez, Alvin B.
#unknown Roofing hammer.
#unknown Undamaged.
#unknown Bag still sealed.
#unknown Fring, Gustavo.
#unknown Samsung laptop computer.
#unknown Damaged.
#unknown Glass screen is broken and in pieces.
#unknown Bag still sealed.
#unknown Fring, Gustavo.
#unknown Framed photograph of two men.
#unknown Damaged.
#unknown The glass is broken and photo has slipped out of its frame.
#unknown Bag appears to be slightly punctured by broken glass.
#unknown Check it out.
#unknown That's not on the manifest.
#unknown All right, so first off, I'm not a marriage counsellor.
#unknown Nor do I take sides in this thing.
#unknown And, not taking sides, mind you but you did put her in charge of your money which I advised against, if you'll recall all of which is not to be construed as an "I told you so.
#unknown " I'm just walking you through my mental process, so to speak.
#unknown So she comes to me with a problem.
#unknown That she's been cooking Beneke's books, he's in Dutch with the IRS and once they audit, it's Rio de Caca for the both of them.
#unknown To which I say, "Hey, let's involve Walt in this discussion.
#unknown " To which she says, "No, let's cut Beneke a cheque so's he can pay off the IRS.
#unknown " Again, not taking sides, but she really was trying to protect you.
#unknown A little feedback here might be nice.
#unknown "Let's involve Walt in this discussion.
#unknown " Yeah, that's what I told her.
#unknown She said no.
#unknown And you didn't argue the point.
#unknown You didn't think to contact me.
#unknown You were a tad preoccupied at the time, if you'll recall.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So you took it upon yourself to give away $622,000 of my money to a man who had been sleeping with my wife.
#unknown She's my client, same as you.
#unknown Does this arrangement get a little tricky at times? Absolutely.
#unknown But I try my best, you know, ethically, in my duty Ethically? I'm sorry.
#unknown I must be hearing things.
#unknown Did you actually just use the word "ethically" in a sentence? You're not Clarence Darrow, Saul.
#unknown You're a twobit busbench lawyer.
#unknown And you work for me.
#unknown Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow never had a client like you ask him for something like this.
#unknown Okay? Yeah, I put my ass on the line for you.
#unknown Huell too.
#unknown He's got fingers like hot dogs.
#unknown He could've easily busted this in two and killed everyone in the office.
#unknown But do I complain? No.
#unknown Beg, borrow or steal, I'm your huckleberry.
#unknown I go the extra mile.
#unknown Only you never told me that kid would wind up in the hospital.
#unknown You know Take that thing and get the hell out of here.
#unknown You and me, we're done.
#unknown What are you? Come on.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown We're done when I say we're done.
#unknown Yes, you are.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I heard what happened to Ted.
#unknown He's not gonna talk.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I forgive you.
#unknown
