walter_white  Right now we've got bigger fish to fry.
mike_ehrmantraut  Bigger fish.
jesse_pinkman  The video cameras.
walter_white  Gus kept cameras on us at the lab at the laundry, God only knows where else.
walter_white  And of course, when I say" us," I'm including you.
jesse_pinkman  Mike, if he taped all that shit us cooking, you picking up If
walter_white  Gus had a record of that and the police get to it before we do
mike_ehrmantraut  You son of a bitch. Mike
walter_white  Mike, it's all on tape somewhere, or a hard drive.
walter_white  Where did he keep it?
mike_ehrmantraut  laptop in his office.
mike_ehrmantraut  Kept it in the back of the restaurant.
mike_ehrmantraut  It all fed straight to there.
walter_white  What?
mike_ehrmantraut  Keys, scumbag.
mike_ehrmantraut  It's the universal symbol for keys.
mike_ehrmantraut  Meter fraud.
mike_ehrmantraut  And yes, yes, it's a big deal.
mike_ehrmantraut  Guy rigs his meter so he's paying 2 cents less for firstclass postage.
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm here to tell you that the USPS takes that very seriously.
mike_ehrmantraut  It's money out of your pocket, it's money out of my pocket.
mike_ehrmantraut  I was hoping Now, look, sarge.
mike_ehrmantraut  Do you think we could work together on this thing?
mike_ehrmantraut  You folks have it over there?
mike_ehrmantraut  Could you tell me that, at least?
mike_ehrmantraut  Well, thanks for your help.
mike_ehrmantraut  Inspector Clark Inspector Dave Clark, like the Dave Clark Five?

mike_ehrmantraut  You know how they say" it's been a pleasure"
mike_ehrmantraut  It hasn't.
walter_white  Are you gonna tell us about the laptop?
jesse_pinkman  Where you going?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm getting the hell out of Dodge, kid.
mike_ehrmantraut  And so should you.
mike_ehrmantraut  It's just a matter of time.
walter_white  Mike, where is the laptop?
mike_ehrmantraut  What the hell difference does it make?
mike_ehrmantraut  They got it
mike_ehrmantraut  it. End of story.
mike_ehrmantraut  D., Northwest Area Command on Second.
mike_ehrmantraut  They tagged it, they filed it it's in the system, and they locked it in their evidence room.
walter_white  All right
walter_white  All right
walter_white  right. So describe the building.
mike_ehrmantraut  Describe the
mike_ehrmantraut  about I describe Fort Knox?
mike_ehrmantraut  And what are you gonna do? Are
mike_ehrmantraut  you gonna put on your black leotard and go dangling on a clothesline?
mike_ehrmantraut  It's a building full of cops.
mike_ehrmantraut  What else do you need to know?
mike_ehrmantraut  And why in the hell am I talking to you?
jesse_pinkman  Mike, we gotta do something.
mike_ehrmantraut  I am doing something.
jesse_pinkman  He's good with this stuff, okay?
jesse_pinkman  Just give him a chance.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, you look.
mike_ehrmantraut  That laptop might as well be on the moon.
mike_ehrmantraut  They build these evidence rooms like bank vaults because guess what lunatics like you wanna break into them.
mike_ehrmantraut  But unlike a bank vault, this is a place that is guarded 24 hours a day by the police.
mike_ehrmantraut  There's no way you're getting it out of there.
walter_white  Who said that we have to get it out of there?
walter_white  We just need to destroy what's on it
mike_ehrmantraut  Oh, so now you wanna blow up a police station?
walter_white  I don't believe I said that, no.
mike_ehrmantraut  Nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now you wanna kill a bunch of cops.
walter_white  I never said anything about killing anybody.
walter_white  I am, however, considering the possibility of a device.
mike_ehrmantraut  A device. Yes
walter_white  Yes, a small device.
walter_white  Say this device gets filed into evidence. Now
walter_white  Now it is inside that room. What
jesse_pinkman  What about a magnet? You
mike_ehrmantraut  You wanna commit a whole other crime just to get this bomb into evidence.
walter_white  Who said" bomb"
walter_white ? I said" a device.
jesse_pinkman " What about a magnet?
walter_white  An incendiary device.
walter_white  One quick fire is all it would take.
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't think they have fire suppression?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm not talking sprinklers.
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm talking about halon.
mike_ehrmantraut  Because halon doesn't destroy evidence. A
jesse_pinkman  A magnet, though, maybe like
walter_white  like A bomb then.
walter_white  We plant a bomb outside.
mike_ehrmantraut  Oh, actually I knew a crew out of Fort Worth that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside.
mike_ehrmantraut  About all they did was take out a couple of hedges. You
mike_ehrmantraut  You are probably talking about 2 feet of reinforced concrete.
jesse_pinkman  Or what about a magnet?
walter_white  What magnet?
walter_white  What about it?
old_joe  Leaving aside engineering rigging some kind of alternate power source my primary sticking point is I actually need the thing.
old_joe  you gentlemen can see, it's paying the bills.
walter_white  But I mean it's feasible, doable? Hey, we're living in a time of
old_joe  of string theories and God particles.
old_joe  Feasible, doable?
old_joe  Yeah, sure, why not
old_joe  Expensive.
jesse_pinkman  you put it in
walter_white  What about that?
walter_white  run?
old_joe  get it running.
walter_white  What's the box made
old_joe  of? Plywood and aluminium, just what you need. All right, so you
walter_white  Step
walter_white  I don't actually have any money right now
walter_white  wife There's an IRS issue.
walter_white  Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could spot me my share.
walter_white  I'll pay you back.
jesse_pinkman  Right. You coming?
mike_ehrmantraut  If you have any brains, you'll take that money you saved and you'll skip town.
mike_ehrmantraut  Today.
mike_ehrmantraut  Right now.
jesse_pinkman  think this can
mike_ehrmantraut  Is that a serious question?
jesse_pinkman  Mike, this is a threeman job.
jesse_pinkman  The only way I know it won't work for sure is if we don't have you.
skyler_white  Come in. Get in.
skyler_white  What did we say about you coming here?
saul_goodman  Yeah, speaking of things that tend to rile you up the police, they may call
saul_goodman  call. Let me back up a little.
saul_goodman  Can I sit down?
saul_goodman  I'm gonna sit down. Okay
skyler_white  Okay, why are the police gonna call?
saul_goodman  May call you.
saul_goodman  Distant, outside possibility.
saul_goodman  But on the off chance, I want you thinking one thought :
saul_goodman  Hogan's Heroes.
saul_goodman  Sergeant Schultz.
saul_goodman  You remember Sergeant Schultz?
saul_goodman " I know nothing.
saul_goodman  I see nothing.

skyler_white  What incident?
saul_goodman  An act of God.
saul_goodman  There's no right.
saul_goodman  There's no wrong.
saul_goodman  I mean, it just That's the best phrase.
saul_goodman  It fits, but we got a problem.
skyler_white  Ted's dead.
saul_goodman  Sorry?
skyler_white  Ted is dead?
saul_goodman  No. No, no.
saul_goodman  He just woke up.
old_joe  her.
old_joe  All right, watches off.
old_joe  Necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets Gold.
walter_white  These are
walter_white  nonferrous. Better
old_joe  Better hope
old_joe  What about that stuff you young guys wear on the end of
old_joe  Speak now or forever sing soprano.
old_joe  What's up with that, by the
old_joe  Why would anybody wanna put a metal ring through the end of their prick?
jesse_pinkman  What are you looking at me for?
old_joe  right, guns, knives tools, keys, plates in your head artificial hips.
old_joe  Check your pockets for me one more time, please.
old_joe  Oh, credit cards.
old_joe  You want that plastic working come Miller time.
mike_ehrmantraut  You know, I can foresee a lot of possible outcomes to this thing and not a single one of them involves Miller time.
old_joe  Positive mental attitude.
old_joe  Okay, I think we're good to go
jesse_pinkman  All right, where do you want me with this?
walter_white  Start 40 feet out.
walter_white  That's more than the length of the room.
old_joe  Who's doing the honours?
walter_white  Me.
old_joe  Flip that switch, turns it on. Twist
old_joe  Twist this here.

old_joe  hundred fiftytwo
walter_white  fiftytwo volts. Can you add 21 more, wired in parallel?
walter_white  UP the amperage?
mike_ehrmantraut  Everything goes flying in that evidence room it's gonna make one hell of a noise, and there goes your element of surprise.
walter_white  Won't matter.
walter_white  Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.
skyler_white  Excuse me.

jacocks  That's not on the manifest.
saul_goodman  All right, so first off, I'm not a marriage counsellor.
saul_goodman  Nor do I take sides in this thing.
saul_goodman  And, not taking sides, mind you but you did put her in charge of your money which I advised against, if you'll recall all of which is not to be construed as an" I told you so.
saul_goodman " I'm just walking you through my mental process, so to speak.
saul_goodman  So she comes to me with a problem.
saul_goodman  That she's been cooking Beneke's books, he's in Dutch with the IRS and once they audit, it's Rio de Caca for the both of them.
saul_goodman  To which I say," Hey, let's involve Walt in this discussion.
saul_goodman " To which she says," No, let's cut Beneke a cheque so's he can pay off the IRS.
saul_goodman  Again, not taking sides, but she really was trying to protect you.
saul_goodman  A little feedback here might be nice.
walter_white  Let's involve Walt in this discussion.
saul_goodman  Yeah, that's what I told her.
saul_goodman  She said no.
walter_white  And you didn't argue the point.
walter_white  You didn't think to contact me.
saul_goodman  You were a tad preoccupied at the time, if you'll recall.
walter_white  So you took it upon yourself to give away $622,000 of my money to a man who had been sleeping with my wife.
saul_goodman  She's my client, same as you.
saul_goodman  Does this arrangement get a little tricky at times?
saul_goodman  Absolutely.
saul_goodman  But I try my best, you know, ethically, in my duty Ethically
walter_white  Ethically?
walter_white  I'm sorry.
walter_white  I must be hearing things.
walter_white  Did you actually just use the word" ethically" in a sentence?
walter_white  You're not Clarence Darrow, Saul.
walter_white  You're a twobit busbench lawyer.
walter_white  And you work for me.
saul_goodman  Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow never had a client like you ask him for something like this.
saul_goodman  Okay?
saul_goodman  Yeah, I put my ass on the line for you.
saul_goodman  Huell too.
saul_goodman  He's got fingers like hot dogs.
saul_goodman  He could've easily busted this in two and killed everyone in the office.
saul_goodman  But do I complain?
saul_goodman  No. Beg
saul_goodman  Beg, borrow or steal, I'm your huckleberry.
saul_goodman  I go the extra mile.
saul_goodman  Only you never told me that kid would wind up in the hospital.
saul_goodman  Take that thing and get the hell out of here.
saul_goodman  You and me, we're done.
saul_goodman  What are you?
saul_goodman  Hey.
saul_goodman  Hey.
walter_white  We're done when I say we're done.
