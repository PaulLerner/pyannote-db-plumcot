#unknown There.
#unknown That's them.
#unknown Your play, Walter.
#unknown You're on your own.
#unknown Looks like you're about 1000 gallons light here, Mike.
#unknown Where's the juice? The methylamine isn't coming.
#unknown Why is that?  And who the hell are you?  I'm the man who's keeping it.
#unknown What the hell's this? We had an agreement, right? We got our deal.
#unknown So where's the tank, Mike? Mike doesn't know where it is.
#unknown Only I do.
#unknown And you're dealing with me now, not him.
#unknown Why don't you just cut to what it is you want or what you think is gonna happen here, all right? Because we're gonna get what we came for.
#unknown That 1000 gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands than it is in yours or anyone else's, for that matter.
#unknown But I need distribution.
#unknown Distribution.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown So if you agree to give up your cook and sell my product instead I'll give you 35 percent of the take.
#unknown Thirtyfive percent? Wow, are you kidding me? Thirtyfive Mike, please tell me this is a joke.
#unknown Know how far we had to stick our necks out to get our hands on this cash? Why the hell would we want you? You know we have our own operation, right? I know all about your operation.
#unknown See, my partners here tell me that you produce a meth that's 70 percent pure, if you're lucky.
#unknown What I produce is 99.
#unknown 1 percent pure.
#unknown So? So it's grade school Tball versus the New York Yankees.
#unknown Yours is just some tepid offbrand, generic cola.
#unknown What I'm making is Classic Coke.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So if we just waste you right here right now and leave you in the desert then there is no more Coke on the market, right? See how that works? There's only us.
#unknown Do you really wanna live in a world without CocaCola? My partner tells me that your crew switched to a P2P cook because of our success.
#unknown You dye your meth with food colouring to make it look like mine.
#unknown You already ape my product at every turn.
#unknown But now you have the opportunity to sell it yourself.
#unknown I need you to listen to me.
#unknown We're not gonna give up this deal to be your errand boys, do you understand? For what? To watch a bunch of junkies get a better high? A better high means customers pay more.
#unknown A higher purity means a greater yield.
#unknown That's 130 million dollars of profit that isn't being pissed away by some substandard cook.
#unknown Now you listen to me.
#unknown You've got the greatest meth cook in A No, the two greatest meth cooks in America right here, and with our skills you'll earn more from that 35 percent than you ever would on your own.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown So you say.
#unknown Just wondering why we're so lucky.
#unknown Why cut us in? Mike is retiring from our crew so his share of the partnership is available if you can handle his end, distribution and if you give him 5 million dollars of the 15 million that you brought today.
#unknown Just think of it as a finder's fee for bringing us together.
#unknown We have 40 pounds of product ready to ship, ready to go.
#unknown Are you ready? Who the hell are you? You know.
#unknown You all know exactly who I am.
#unknown Say my name.
#unknown Do what? I don't have a damn clue who the hell you are.
#unknown Yeah, you do.
#unknown I'm the cook.
#unknown I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.
#unknown Bullshit.
#unknown Cartel got Fring.
#unknown Are you sure? That's right.
#unknown Now, say my name.
#unknown You're Heisenberg.
#unknown You're goddamn right.
#unknown I gotta hand it to you, Walter.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I appreciate the kind words but I'm out too, remember? I know.
#unknown We'll talk.
#unknown Maybe we should talk about how and when I'm gonna get my 5 million dollars.
#unknown And we will do that.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown It's just, you know Look, Jesse, just give me some time here, okay? I'll need help getting things up and running during this transition.
#unknown You can at least do that for me, right? Come on.
#unknown Don't worry.
#unknown We'll figure it out.
#unknown Well, I guess that's it.
#unknown Parting thoughts, of which I have two: First, as I said I'll handle the legacy costs out of my end so you won't have to worry about my guys anymore.
#unknown Second, the bug.
#unknown The DEA will do a sweep.
#unknown Can't say when, could be anytime.
#unknown But you need to get it out of there, sooner rather than later.
#unknown All right.
#unknown That's it? No "thanks for the 5 million dollars," no "sorry for chaining you to a radiator"? Just get the bug, Walter.
#unknown So, hey.
#unknown I guess I guess I'll see you around.
#unknown No.
#unknown Don't think so.
#unknown When I'm out, I'm out.
#unknown Well, I'm out too, Mike.
#unknown Kid, just look out for yourself.
#unknown Are we good?  You tell me.
#unknown Okay, Jesse.
#unknown Back it up.
#unknown You're good.
#unknown Keep it coming.
#unknown Straight back.
#unknown Slow it down.
#unknown All right.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown Hey, Mrs.
#unknown White.
#unknown "Vamonos.
#unknown " I Wish.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let's get this thing hooked up.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown What is this? Do you really wanna know?  Why are you hiding it here?  Don't worry about it.
#unknown Who are you hiding it from? I said don't worry about it.
#unknown From the police? Or someone else? Someone who would kill for it? Why don't you go back in the office? Why don't you go back in the office and let us do this? We'll get it out of your hair.
#unknown What'd you bring me this time? They're bacon banana cookies.
#unknown Is there bacon in these? Oh, my God! Just bits.
#unknown Just little bits of bacon.
#unknown Just enough to make those suckers really pop.
#unknown Dan, this is too much.
#unknown I'm not sharing those.
#unknown Bad office etiquette? I don't give a crap.
#unknown They're mine.
#unknown They're yours to do with as you please.
#unknown Good, because my husband's not getting any either.
#unknown How is Mickey?  Don't get me started.
#unknown He wants to buy a boat.
#unknown I can't even get him to start the lawnmower and he wants to buy a boat.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown A boat might be nice.
#unknown A little one, maybe.
#unknown Oh, please.
#unknown Where would you even take a boat? All the way down to Elephant Butte? Or Caballo.
#unknown It's beautiful down there.
#unknown You can even leave it at the lake if you don't want to haul it.
#unknown We're not buying a boat, I'll tell you that right now.
#unknown And the last one is 545.
#unknown 569.
#unknown Dang it.
#unknown I almost got them all that time.
#unknown Very good.
#unknown But actually, I've got an extra one for you this week.
#unknown 603.
#unknown 603.
#unknown Where is that?  Right down there.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I'll let you get to it.
#unknown Thanks, Dot.
#unknown Young Kaylee's gonna need a second safety deposit box if you decide to leave one more dollar to her.
#unknown How's the rest of it? Oh, it's empty, as usual.
#unknown The families are pretty reliable with the pickups.
#unknown Nobody complaining about wanting it all at once? No, they get it.
#unknown Slow and steady wins the race.
#unknown So I guess this is it for a while? Don't worry about the families.
#unknown They'll keep getting their deliveries.
#unknown I know times are tight, but it's for the kids and your sponsorship would sure be appreciated.
#unknown Yeah, we have a silver level, but the gold and platinum levels really get your name out there on the banners and Tshirts.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown No, that's not a problem.
#unknown You call me directly if things change, you hear? Gomey, take a brick to my head if I ever have to make another Fun Run call.
#unknown I'm done.
#unknown What's up? Why you smiling? Because the Ehrmantraut warrant just came in.
#unknown Now we're talking.
#unknown How quick can you get your group together?  Two, three hours.
#unknown Make it two.
#unknown We're gonna nail that son of a bi Police! Search warrant! Police! Search warrant! Coming.
#unknown Hold your horses.
#unknown Search warrant.
#unknown Police! Search warrant!  Police.
#unknown Search warrant.
#unknown Police.
#unknown Search warrant.
#unknown How's that restraining order working out for you? If you want me to read that, I'm gonna need my glasses.
#unknown Too bad you had to make the trip out from headquarters, sergeant.
#unknown From out of bed, you mean.
#unknown When a cop kills himself, they want a full report.
#unknown Just to say hello to who's in charge of the Record Bureau.
#unknown A single contact wound.
#unknown Powder burn on his temple and right hand.
#unknown Suicide, I'll bet you.
#unknown Tell the wagon boys they can have him.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown When I found him, he was He was dead.
#unknown Hey! Perfect timing.
#unknown Just about to get started.
#unknown You know, if you can get going on that settling tank that would be a huge help.
#unknown We left that stuff in there too long after the last cook.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White  I mean way too long.
#unknown Now we have a tremendous amount of residue.
#unknown You know what we need to invest in is a power washer.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, can we just take a second and talk about all this? Yeah, yeah, sure.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Look, you know what I think we need to talk about? Is doubling down.
#unknown Doubling down? Cooking 100 pounds a week, not 50.
#unknown As in starting a new lab, a lab that you'll run.
#unknown A cook all of your own.
#unknown Why not? You deserve it.
#unknown You're every bit as good as me.
#unknown Well, what do you think? Mr.
#unknown White, I think that nothing has changed for me.
#unknown I just wanna get my money and get out.
#unknown Jesse, this What we do being the best at something is a very rare thing.
#unknown You don't just toss something like that away.
#unknown And what, you wanna squander that potential? Your potential? Why? To do what?  I don't know.
#unknown Well, think.
#unknown To do what, Jesse? I'll I'll figure it out, all right? Look at you.
#unknown What have you got in your life, huh? Nothing.
#unknown Nobody.
#unknown Oh, wait.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Video games and gocarts  Mr.
#unknown W And when you get tired of that, what then? And how soon will you start using again? Look Look, I know how upset you are about what happened to this boy.
#unknown I am just as upset as you are.
#unknown Are you? Really? How can you say that to me? Jesus! I mean, I'm the one who's the father here.
#unknown What, do I have to curl up in a ball in tears in front of you? Do I have to lock myself away in a room and get high to prove it to you? What happened to that boy is a tragedy and it tears me up inside! But because it happened, what, am I supposed to just lie down and die with him? It's done! It makes me sick that it happened just like everyone else who has died in our wake.
#unknown What Todd did you and I have done things that are just as bad.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown All the people that we've killed, Gale and the rest.
#unknown If you believe that there's a hell, I don't know if you're into that but we're already pretty much going there, right? But I'm not gonna lie down until I get there.
#unknown What, just because I don't wanna cook meth anymore, I'm lying down? How many more people are gonna die because of us? No one.
#unknown None.
#unknown Now that we're in control, no one else gets hurt You keep saying that, and it's bullshit every time!  No.
#unknown Always! You know what? I'm done, okay? You just give me my money, and you and I, we're done.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Why? Why do you want this money? Because it's mine.
#unknown It's my cut.
#unknown But isn't it filthy blood money? I mean, you're so pure.
#unknown You have such emotional depth.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown You shouldn't touch that dirty money.
#unknown I'll save you from that, Jesse.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown You want it.
#unknown You want it just as much as I want it.
#unknown And it's not wrong to want it.
#unknown Okay? So stay and work with me and you can make ten ti Twenty times as much.
#unknown Whatever, man.
#unknown You don't wanna pay me, I don't care.
#unknown Yes, you do.
#unknown It's on you, all right?  I'm done.
#unknown No, you're not.
#unknown You're not done.
#unknown You're not leaving.
#unknown Because if you leave, you get nothing! Do you understand me? Nothing! Jesse! Budget for the current fiscal year for electronic surveillance is 1.
#unknown 5 million, on par with ATF and the Marshal Service but still just a fraction of FBI totals.
#unknown We're lobbying Congress for an additional 1.
#unknown 41 but we're waiting on action reports to demonstrate we 're actually getting worthwhile results.
#unknown Our undercover operations reap the most successful actionable intelligence if you refer to the chart in Appendix 4.
#unknown If ASAC Schrader can tell us about the surveillance manhours.
#unknown .
#unknown .
#unknown .
#unknown Hank? Hank? Hank! I think we're going to wrap this up.
#unknown If ASAC Schrader can stay behind while everyone else clears out.
#unknown Thank you, everybody.
#unknown You know no one wants to see you succeed at this more than me, right?  Yes, sir.
#unknown I know how good you are.
#unknown I wouldn't have stuck my neck out to get you here if I didn't.
#unknown But you're not knocking down doors anymore, bubba.
#unknown You're in charge of a district office, and that comes with responsibilities.
#unknown I mean, Hank, basic reports aren't being filed in a timely manner.
#unknown I'll work on it.
#unknown It'll get better.
#unknown Yeah, it will, because way too much time and money is being spent on the Fring case, a case which is essentially over.
#unknown All this overtime to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut? That's just money that could be better spent elsewhere.
#unknown I understand, but I'm not making these choices lightly.
#unknown We've got increased reports of blue meth on the street Fring's gang is still operational, and Ehrmantraut is involved.
#unknown It's that simple.
#unknown I believe you.
#unknown But so what? It's one case out of dozens, and you don't play favourites  with it because it used to be yours.
#unknown I really think Don't play favourites.
#unknown You got a bigger job than that.
#unknown I mean, forget the financial cost.
#unknown I hear you're personally serving search warrants out in the field? That was an error in judgment.
#unknown Won't happen again.
#unknown You're damn right it won't.
#unknown I'm just gonna bottomline this for you.
#unknown The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut is now zero.
#unknown We clear? Sure.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Clear.
#unknown Good.
#unknown We'll be in touch.
#unknown Yeah?  Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown So Ramey wanted to catch up with you? Talk sports and stuff, I guess? Yeah, something like that.
#unknown No more following Ehrmantraut.
#unknown Not worth the financial investment.
#unknown Well, it's not like the guy's going anywhere.
#unknown He's not even bothering to throw our tails anymore.
#unknown He's just living a boring oldman life like he has nothing left to hide.
#unknown And none of Fring's crew is talking?  Not giving an inch.
#unknown You sweeten the pot enough? Zero jail time and an allexpensepaid trip to Maui? Not that, but close.
#unknown Nobody wants to bite.
#unknown Christ! They're either the most loyal crew in history or someone's paying them off.
#unknown You still checking bank records?  No one living beyond their means.
#unknown Nine perps, all being represented by one lawyer.
#unknown Not unusual in a case like this.
#unknown Yeah, this guy, what's his name? Daniel Wachsberger? He represents every one of these douche bags except for Ehrmantraut.
#unknown Can we find out more about the lawyer? You want me to start tailing a lawyer? Like the shit ain't deep enough for you already.
#unknown Ramey said we couldn't follow Ehrmantraut.
#unknown He didn't say anything about anybody else.
#unknown Do it.
#unknown You're the boss.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Shall we get started? Now, I know that most of this, or all of this, is gonna be new to you.
#unknown But did you take chemistry in high school? Just basic? No.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown That's all right.
#unknown As we go, I'll be as detailed as possible without being overwhelming.
#unknown Yes, sir.
#unknown Look, Todd, I don't need you to be Antoine Lavoisier.
#unknown What I do need is your full effort and attention.
#unknown Listen and apply yourself.
#unknown If you do that, then we just might have a fighting chance here, okay?  Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, here we go.
#unknown Slowly.
#unknown Steady.
#unknown The aluminium helps speed up the delivery of hydrogen chloride.
#unknown Gently pour it in.
#unknown Don't spill it.
#unknown You're gonna like the little Schticky, but you're gonna love the big Schticky.
#unknown For bigger messes like dust bunnies Now the CO2 freezes the liquid crystallising it which gives us our finished methamphetamine.
#unknown Now all that's left is to break it up, weigh it, and we're done.
#unknown Wow, this is This is complicated.
#unknown It's gonna take me a few more times to get a grasp on it.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown It'll take a few more times.
#unknown I do all right? You did fine, Todd.
#unknown You applied yourself.
#unknown That's as much as I can ask.
#unknown Now all that's left, I guess, is to talk money.
#unknown We can talk money once I get this right.
#unknown Morning.
#unknown Guess what I have.
#unknown Cake pops.
#unknown They're balls of cake on a stick.
#unknown Very nice.
#unknown Thank you, Dan.
#unknown See? I put little faces on them.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I'm working with a new guy now.
#unknown And I think that it I think it could possibly work out .
#unknown "because"" I'm trying, Hank.
#unknown I really am.
#unknown I'm trying, but there's There's I mean, it's like I don't even exist to her.
#unknown Well, yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I mean, I know she's struggling.
#unknown I know, but I just don't know what to do.
#unknown I mean, what can I do? Such a mess.
#unknown I mean, we Both of us we just have screwed up so much.
#unknown I'm just I'm sorry.
#unknown I don't Do you have any coffee?  Maybe I can  Coffee? You bet.
#unknown Yeah, you bet.
#unknown What, you take cream, right? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Here you go, buddy.
#unknown Oh, thank you, Hank.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Look, I'm sorry to waste your time  with all this.
#unknown No.
#unknown It's, you know But it's You know.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown Hey, could you excuse me? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
#unknown Sure, sure.
#unknown Tell me something good.
#unknown You tell me.
#unknown Sweated the guy for 14 hours.
#unknown That should be some kind of record.
#unknown Quit your bragging.
#unknown What'd you get? He's gonna do it.
#unknown He's gonna flip.
#unknown He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut? What are you wasting your time for? Throw a net around that son of a bitch.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Yeah?  Mike, hey, it's me.
#unknown Can you talk?  I can.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Look, there's a small situation with the money.
#unknown I don't wanna do this on the phone.
#unknown Are you available? I can come by in a few hours.
#unknown That's not good for me.
#unknown Where are you now? I'm at the park with my granddaughter.
#unknown Where exactly? Palomita.
#unknown Oh, you know what? I'm not far.
#unknown I'll come to you.
#unknown You just hang tight.
#unknown Yeah?  Mike, they're coming for you.
#unknown Right now.
#unknown They're coming.
#unknown Slow down, Walter.
#unknown Who? The DEA.
#unknown The DEA Somebody ï¬ipped.
#unknown They have some kind of bank surveillance.
#unknown And something about some lawyer.
#unknown Someone is talking, Mike, and they're coming for you right now How could Mike use that clown of a lawyer? Dan Wachsberger.
#unknown He would've had better luck with the law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.
#unknown Always consult with me before using outside counsel.
#unknown All right, Saul, enough, please.
#unknown Instead of just sitting around here  what can we do?  Besides pray that he gets away I'm open to ideas.
#unknown Because if the DEA catches up with him and he flips, it's good night, Johnboy.
#unknown No.
#unknown No way Mike would ever flip, okay? No way.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Never say never.
#unknown This is the second time the DEA has confiscated his bankroll.
#unknown You know? Jesus, fool me once, right? Look, he won't flip.
#unknown But his nine guys will.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown It's him.
#unknown Mike, I got you on speaker phone with the brain trust.
#unknown The what?  The Walt and Jesse are here.
#unknown I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.
#unknown I want you.
#unknown I need your help.
#unknown What do you need?  I got a gobag at the airport.
#unknown Passports, money, but there are eyes everywhere.
#unknown I can't get close.
#unknown I need you to pick up that bag and get it to me as soon as possible.
#unknown Do you know how thick the crap storm is out there? Told you not to use that lawyer.
#unknown He's a hack!  Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
#unknown Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?  Just tell me what to do.
#unknown No, kid.
#unknown Not you.
#unknown I'm paying Saul.
#unknown He can do the job just fine.
#unknown Yeah, you're paying me, and the DEA knows I represent you so they're probably sitting on my car right now, hoping I do something stupid.
#unknown Mike, I can do it, okay? It's not a problem.
#unknown No, Jesse.
#unknown Jesus, I'll do it.
#unknown Besides, you're out, remember? Mike, tell me where to get this bag.
#unknown Hello, Walter.
#unknown Before I hand this over, I need something from you.
#unknown And what's that?  The names of your nine men.
#unknown Why? You're never gonna pay them off.
#unknown What's the point? The point is, Mike, it affects me.
#unknown It affects Jesse too.
#unknown And we deserve to know.
#unknown The only thing left to do now is leave town.
#unknown You understand? "Leave town.
#unknown " Yeah, I just can't up and leave like you, Mike.
#unknown I've got a family, I've got people who depend on me.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Goodbye, Walter.
#unknown You're welcome! I'm sorry, what? I want those names, Mike.
#unknown You owe me that much.
#unknown I don't owe you a damn thing.
#unknown All of this, falling apart like this, is on you.
#unknown Oh, that's some kind of logic right there, Mike.
#unknown You screw up, get yourself followed by the DEA and now suddenly, this is all my fault?  Why don't you walk me through this?  We had a good thing you stupid son of a bitch! We had Fring.
#unknown We had a lab.
#unknown We had everything we needed, and it all ran like clockwork.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown You could've shut your mouth cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed.
#unknown It was perfect.
#unknown But, no, you just had to blow it up.
#unknown You and your pride and your ego! You just had to be the man.
#unknown If you'd done your job, known your place we'd all be fine right now.
#unknown I just I just realised that Lydia has the names.
#unknown I can get them from her.
#unknown I'm sorry, Mike.
#unknown This This whole thing could've been avoided.
#unknown Shut the fuck up and let me die in peace.
#unknown
