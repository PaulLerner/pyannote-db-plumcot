walter_white  Hilarious, Groucho.
walter_white  Go on, grab a seat.
walter_white  Juice is on the table.
skyler_white  Good morning, honey.
walter_white_jr.  Hey, Mom.
walter_white_jr.  Dad's cooking breakfast. But
walter_white  But don't worry.
walter_white  I'm also doing all the dishes.
walter_white  Nice?
walter_white  Follow me.
walter_white  There's also orange juice and grapefruit juice which, personally, as you know, I've never been a fan of.
walter_white  But considering all the polyphenols and the limonoids, can't hurt.
skyler_white  Walt, you didn't have to do this.
walter_white  I wanted
walter_white  Grapefruit juice
walter_white_jr.  Yes, please. Thanks
walter_white_jr.  Thanks.
walter_white  Honey?

walter_white  Pancakes are not getting hotter.
walter_white_jr.  you go.
walter_white  All
walter_white  All right. Got
walter_white  Got one.
walter_white  Steely Dan.
walter_white_jr.  No.
walter_white  Yes, absolutely.
walter_white  No, in terms of pure musicianship I would put them up against any current band you can name.
walter_white_jr.  You wouldn't know any current bands. That's
walter_white  besides the point.
skyler_white  Have a good day, honey.
walter_white_jr.  You too.
walter_white  Boz Scaggs.
walter_white  There's
skyler_white  There's another

skyler_white  Bye. You're welcome
walter_white  welcome.
walter_white  Tell Louis to drive carefully.
walter_white_jr.  All right.
walter_white  Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is.

walter_white  Stop it.
walter_white  your plate. No
walter_white  No, no.
walter_white  I'll get it. I'll
walter_white  I'll get it.
walter_white  Thank
skyler_white  Thank you.
walter_white  Hey, listen in the calendar section all week long there's a fiction writer's seminar at UNM.
walter_white  And, you know, probably talking about how to get published and that sort of thing.
skyler_white  Yeah,
skyler_white  so, anyway, I thought maybe you might
walter_white  I mean, I'll go with you if you like.
walter_white  Oh, and you know, I was thinking about what you asked me the other night.
walter_white  You were wondering if I had a second cell phone.
walter_white  And, well, I've been thinking about that a lot and I think what you heard was my cell phone alarm going off.
walter_white  I've been using it a lot as a medication reminder to, well, remind me to take my medication.
walter_white  And, well, the weird thing is that the alarm sound is almost exactly the same as the regular phone ring which is really a poor design if you ask me.
walter_white  But I think that was probably it.
walter_white  I tried to go in and change it to a different sound other than the phone ring, but.
walter_white  They so overcomplicate these things.
walter_white  Anyway, it was probably just as well that I lost it.
walter_white  There's gotta be a new one on the market by now.
walter_white  You know, if we do this thing at UNM, maybe on the way home we can stop by, and I can get a new cell phone.
walter_white  Skyler?
walter_white  Skyler?
mr._gardiner  Ready?
jesse_pinkman  Yo, for what, might help.
jesse_pinkman  Not another intervention.
mr._gardiner  Jesse Bruce Pinkman pursuant to Section 47813 of the New Mexico Real Property Code you are hereby given notice to vacate the premises listed as 9809 Margo, Albuquerque, 87104. Wait. What
jesse_pinkman  What?
jesse_pinkman  You're kicking me out of my own house?
adam_pinkman  It's your aunt Ginny's house.
jesse_pinkman  And she gave it to me.
adam_pinkman  She never gave it to you, Jesse.
mr._gardiner  You were allowed residentiary privileges. Your
mr._gardiner  Your parents have always been the property owners.
jesse_pinkman  we talked about this, okay? I'd
jesse_pinkman  I'd sell the house, we'd split it fiftyfifty. That
jesse_pinkman  That was the deal.
jesse_pinkman  What the hell happened?
adam_pinkman  What happened is you're a speed manufacturer. No
jesse_pinkman  I'm not.
jesse_pinkman  What?
mrs._pinkman  A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse.
mrs._pinkman  He came to our front door.
jesse_pinkman  Okay, because I've actually been helping them which I could get into a lot of trouble for telling you so you're welcome.
mrs._pinkman  saw your basement.
mrs._pinkman  I was worried, so I went over there and I let myself in and I found your laboratory.
jesse_pinkman  You guys have your own key?
mr._gardiner  Manufacture of a Schedule II controlled substance is a second degree felony.
mr._gardiner  Under federal asset seizure the government can take the entire house.
jesse_pinkman  It's not even there anymore. I
jesse_pinkman  I cleaned it all out.
adam_pinkman  Son, we can't stop you from ruining your life but you will not drag us down with
mr._gardiner  Vacate the house in 72 hours.
mr._gardiner  Otherwise, your parents have authorised me to contact the authorities.
mr._gardiner  Is that clear?
mr._gardiner  Do you have any questions for us?
mr._gardiner  Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

mrs._pinkman  You don't answer your phone?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, no, I've just been pretty busy.

jesse_pinkman  Oh, right, you have that key.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, listen.
jesse_pinkman  I've been thinking a lot about our conversation we had the other day, and I completely get why Dad totally tweaked off on me like that and.

jesse_pinkman  You know, we're talking, starting a dialogue.
mrs._pinkman  The time for talking has passed, Jesse.
jesse_pinkman  Hey.
jesse_pinkman  What the hell, yo?
jesse_pinkman  I thought it was just a wakeup call.
mrs._pinkman  We are putting it in storage.
mrs._pinkman  When you decide to grow up, you can have it back.
jesse_pinkman  Why don't you grow up, Mom?
jesse_pinkman  Ginny wanted me here.
jesse_pinkman  I was the one who took care of her
jesse_pinkman  I took her to her appointments and made her lunch every day.
jesse_pinkman  I earned this.
mrs._pinkman  You did not make her lunch every day.
mrs._pinkman  What did you do, huh?
jesse_pinkman  She's lying there dying, and where the hell are you?
mrs._pinkman  Don't start with me.
jesse_pinkman  Now what?
