#unknown Hey, Captain America.
#unknown What's up, brother? Hey, bro.
#unknown This is stupid.
#unknown You got a better idea? Okay, fun.
#unknown Whatever.
#unknown So when do we, you know? We don't, for now.
#unknown No cooking until things settle down.
#unknown Settle down? I thought you're the one that said nothing's changed.
#unknown Look, I just put my family through an ordeal that they're just now starting to accept, okay? I can't That's too expensive.
#unknown Look, I can't leave my house for more than 20 minutes without my wife worrying.
#unknown I need time to mend fences.
#unknown Okay, so while you're fixing fences, what about me, huh? Your Ahole brotherinlaw took all my money.
#unknown That's $600.
#unknown Okay, what about the rest? Rest of what? Half your money's mine.
#unknown Fiftyfifty partners.
#unknown That's our business motto.
#unknown Meaning what, exactly? That I suffer for your carelessness? You're the one who wanted to work with Tuco.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown If it weren't for that, none of this would've happened.
#unknown Just be cool.
#unknown We'll talk about this later, okay? As for now, no contact.
#unknown Understood? Where are you going? I leave first.
#unknown Walt! In the kitchen.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I didn't know you were allowed to touch the stove.
#unknown Hilarious, Groucho.
#unknown Go on, grab a seat.
#unknown Juice is on the table.
#unknown What? Good morning, honey.
#unknown Hey, Mom.
#unknown Dad's cooking breakfast.
#unknown But don't worry.
#unknown I'm also doing all the dishes.
#unknown Nice? Follow me.
#unknown There's also orange juice and grapefruit juice which, personally, as you know, I've never been a fan of.
#unknown But considering all the polyphenols and the limonoids, can't hurt.
#unknown Walt, you didn't have to do this.
#unknown I wanted to.
#unknown Grapefruit juice? Yes, please.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown Honey? No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Dig in, dig in.
#unknown Pancakes are not getting hotter.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Got one.
#unknown Steely Dan.
#unknown No.
#unknown Yes, absolutely.
#unknown No, in terms of pure musicianship I would put them up against any current band you can name.
#unknown You wouldn't know any current bands.
#unknown That's besides the point.
#unknown Have a good day, honey.
#unknown You too.
#unknown Boz Scaggs.
#unknown There's another one.
#unknown Boz Scaggs.
#unknown Whoever they are.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Thanks for breakfast.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown You're welcome.
#unknown Tell Louis to drive carefully.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Our son doesn't know who Boz Scaggs is.
#unknown We have failed as parents.
#unknown Come to think of it I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
#unknown Stop it.
#unknown Give me your plate.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown I'll get it.
#unknown I'll get it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Hey, listen in the calendar section all week long there's a fiction writer's seminar at UNM.
#unknown And, you know, probably talking about how to get published and that sort of thing.
#unknown Yeah? Yeah, so, anyway, I thought maybe you might.
#unknown I mean, I'll go with you if you like.
#unknown Oh, and you know, I was thinking about what you asked me the other night.
#unknown You were wondering if I had a second cell phone.
#unknown And, well, I've been thinking about that a lot and I think what you heard was my cell phone alarm going off.
#unknown I've been using it a lot as a medication reminder to, well, remind me to take my medication.
#unknown And, well, the weird thing is that the alarm sound is almost exactly the same as the regular phone ring which is really a poor design if you ask me.
#unknown But I think that was probably it.
#unknown I tried to go in and change it to a different sound other than the phone ring, but.
#unknown They so overcomplicate these things.
#unknown Anyway, it was probably just as well that I lost it.
#unknown There's gotta be a new one on the market by now.
#unknown You know, if we do this thing at UNM, maybe on the way home we can stop by, and I can get a new cell phone.
#unknown Skyler? Skyler? Ready? Yo, for what, might help.
#unknown Not another intervention.
#unknown Jesse Bruce Pinkman pursuant to Section 47813 of the New Mexico Real Property Code you are hereby given notice to vacate the premises listed as 9809 Margo, Albuquerque, 87104.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown What? You're kicking me out of my own house? It's your aunt Ginny's house.
#unknown And she gave it to me.
#unknown She never gave it to you, Jesse.
#unknown You were allowed residentiary privileges.
#unknown Your parents have always been the property owners.
#unknown Look, we talked about this, okay? I'd sell the house, we'd split it fiftyfifty.
#unknown That was the deal.
#unknown What the hell happened? What happened is you're a speed manufacturer.
#unknown No, I'm not.
#unknown What? A DEA agent came looking for you, Jesse.
#unknown He came to our front door.
#unknown Okay, because I've actually been helping them which I could get into a lot of trouble for telling you so you're welcome.
#unknown I saw your basement.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown I was worried, so I went over there and I let myself in and I found your laboratory.
#unknown You guys have your own key? Manufacture of a Schedule II controlled substance is a second degree felony.
#unknown Under federal asset seizure the government can take the entire house.
#unknown It's not even there anymore.
#unknown I cleaned it all out.
#unknown Son, we can't stop you from ruining your life but you will not drag us down with you.
#unknown Vacate the house in 72 hours.
#unknown Otherwise, your parents have authorised me to contact the authorities.
#unknown Is that clear? Do you have any questions for us? Three days, Mr.
#unknown Pinkman.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I fixed the garage door.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown One track was bent.
#unknown That's why it was bouncing.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Where were you today? Out.
#unknown Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine.
#unknown Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking about going back to those meetings the cancer support group.
#unknown I think that that's good.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, that's good.
#unknown You were right on the money about that.
#unknown It's good to, you know talk about things.
#unknown I think that's great.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Hey, Jesse.
#unknown You don't answer your phone? Yeah, no, I've just been pretty busy.
#unknown How'd you? Oh, right, you have that key.
#unknown Hey, listen.
#unknown So I've been thinking a lot about our conversation we had the other day, and I completely get why Dad totally tweaked off on me like that and.
#unknown It's not just your father, Jesse.
#unknown No, I know.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I'm just saying it was a really, really big wakeup call for me which is why I wanted to talk to you.
#unknown You know, I've been thinking real seriously about business school, actually.
#unknown You can do the whole thing from your computer now.
#unknown No, Mom, Mom.
#unknown Hey, hey, this is good.
#unknown You know, we're talking, starting a dialogue.
#unknown The time for talking has passed, Jesse.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown What the hell, yo? I thought it was just a wakeup call.
#unknown We are putting it in storage.
#unknown When you decide to grow up, you can have it back.
#unknown Why don't you grow up, Mom? Ginny wanted me here.
#unknown I was the one who took care of her.
#unknown I took her to her appointments and made her lunch every day.
#unknown I earned this.
#unknown You did not make her lunch every day.
#unknown What did you do, huh? She's lying there dying, and where the hell are you? Don't start with me.
#unknown Now what? You've decided to, I don't know, make your eldest son homeless? Great family, Mom.
#unknown Why are you like this? Why? You have two sets of keys and the padlock to the garage.
#unknown Leave them on the kitchen counter when you leave.
#unknown No, Mom, Mom, Mom.
#unknown Hey, where am I supposed to go? I don't know, sweetheart.
#unknown But please turn your life around.
#unknown Yeah, this is gonna help bigtime with that.
#unknown Bitch! Jeez.
#unknown Oh, hey, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Hey, well, that's the way.
#unknown Don't just sit out there honking.
#unknown Come in and say hello.
#unknown Hey, we've got omelettes.
#unknown You want an omelette? No, I'm good.

#unknown It's what he likes to be called these days.
#unknown What's wrong with Walter Jr.
#unknown ? Don't take it personally.
#unknown He wants his own identity.
#unknown You think he told Louis about me? About the blackout? Louis is his friend, Walt and your disappearance upset him.
#unknown Hey, I made omelettes.
#unknown I'm going out, but thanks, though.
#unknown Where you going? Can you get the phone, please? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Absolutely.

#unknown Is this a good time? What part of " no contact" didn't you understand? I know, but there's a problem.
#unknown I don't care.
#unknown We agreed.
#unknown No amount of payperview channels is gonna make any difference.
#unknown Honey, we're happy with our cable provider, right? Yeah, we're happy.
#unknown Skyler? Sky? Where are you going? Can you at least tell me that? Out.
#unknown Should probably get that, Walt.
#unknown I'll be back in a few hours.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown What? Yo, I get I shouldn't call but I'm in a situation here, and I need my money.
#unknown I just gave you $600.

#unknown I was thinking maybe this would be a good time to talk.
#unknown I dreamt that I owned an antique bicycle repair shop.
#unknown In Ireland.
#unknown Weird.
#unknown Sounds weird.
#unknown I wanted to apologise for everything.
#unknown My desire for privacy.

#unknown I feel like you're upset with me because you think that I'm up to something.
#unknown Like what? I have no idea, Skyler.
#unknown What, that I'm having an affair? Is that it? Is that what you think? Is that why you asked me about the.

#unknown I just What if Skyler had seen you? What then? What was the plan then, genius, huh? I don't know.
#unknown You know why you don't know? Because you don't think.
#unknown That's why.
#unknown You don't think.
#unknown You never figured out how to think.
#unknown I said I was sorry.
#unknown I just need my half of the money, and I will go.
#unknown Your half? There is no your half of the money.
#unknown There is only my all of it.
#unknown Do you understand? Why should I be penalised because of your sloppiness? Look, that is completely uncool, all right? We agreed, fiftyfifty partners.
#unknown Partners in what? What exactly do you do here? I've been meaning to ask, because I'm the producer, right? I cook.
#unknown But from what I can tell, you are just a drug addict.
#unknown You are a pathetic junkie, too stupid to understand and follow simple rudimentary instructions.
#unknown Too stupid to re Do it.
#unknown Try not to touch anything.
#unknown Want some breakfast?
