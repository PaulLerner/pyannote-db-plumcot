#unknown Nitrogen: 1.
#unknown 25%.
#unknown 1.
#unknown 25.
#unknown That brings it to 99 and a quarter.
#unknown Which only leaves you with the trace elements down where the magic happens.
#unknown Oh, wait a minute.
#unknown What about calcium? Calcium's not a trace.
#unknown Got a whole skeleton to account for.
#unknown You would think, right?  Right.
#unknown Calcium.
#unknown Calcium is only .
#unknown 25%.
#unknown What? That low? Seriously? Damn, I never would have thought that.
#unknown Okay, so where does iron fit in? Iron.

#unknown Supposedly that's everything.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown I just I just Just seems like something's missing, doesn't it? There got to be more to a human being than that.
#unknown These shoes make me look like I should be changing bedpans, like I should be squeaking around bringing soup to some disgusting old person, then take the bus home to my 16 cats.
#unknown Then why are you wearing them? I like the support.
#unknown My arches happen to be extremely archy.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown What's up? Hey, can you call me, like, in two minutes? Thanks.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Gotta go take this.
#unknown Female? Louis.
#unknown Not like it's any of your business, though.
#unknown Just be quick about it.
#unknown Oh, and, um, please don't say yo.
#unknown You can't know how much I hate that.
#unknown You missed a spot right there.
#unknown Should you be up on that ladder? You're more than welcome to take over for me up here.
#unknown I don't see why you don't just get Walt to do it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown There's an idea.
#unknown So, I'm working on this new short story, and there's this stoner character in it, and I'm trying to Well, know you, actually, let me back up.
#unknown You've smoked your fair share of pot in college, didn't you? I mean, you at least tried it.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown I perhaps tried it.
#unknown Why? Do you rember it having an effect on your mood, like changing it in any major way, or It made me more serious.
#unknown Really? Because I mostly rember it made me lightheaded.
#unknown That's about it.
#unknown I was just wondering if it maybe could You know, it's just a character thing I'm stuck on.
#unknown Never mind.
#unknown Walter Jr.
#unknown 's on pot?  What? No! No.
#unknown What would make you even  Where's he getting it from?  Marie.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown Is it this Louis person? What are you going to do about this? You need to look me in the eye.
#unknown I am strictly asking about a story that I am writing, that's all.
#unknown Right hand to God, Walter Jr.
#unknown is not on pot.
#unknown Certainly not as far as I know.
#unknown Not as far as you know? Marie.
#unknown Look at me.
#unknown Hey, turn around and look at me.
#unknown This This here I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.
#unknown This is degrading.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown You hope I'll make it easy on you and just drop dead, don't you? Well, I won't.
#unknown So either kill me or let me go.
#unknown You don't have it in you, Walter.
#unknown How do you know my name? Jesse.
#unknown He told Emilio and me.
#unknown When he came by to sell your meth? So what? You threaten him, huh?  Did you beat it out of him?  Not even close.
#unknown What else did he tell you? Pretty much everything you can think of.
#unknown How you were his high school teacher.
#unknown How one time you taught about carbon dioxide by making grape soda in class.
#unknown How you have a son who's retarded, or in a wheelchair or something.
#unknown This shouldn't come across as some news flash.
#unknown That partner of yours he's got a big mouth.
#unknown Walter, I don't know what you think you're doing here, but trust me, this line of work doesn't suit you.
#unknown So I should just let you go, then? Just unlock you and adios, huh? I don't see what real choice you have if it's between that and coldblooded murder.
#unknown Besides your real problem is sitting upstairs.
#unknown Occupied! Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off in here! Just give me some privacy, would ya? What the hell, man? What are you doing, man?  You asshole!  You told him my name.
#unknown Says who? Him?  My name, where I work.
#unknown You told him about my son!  Don't touch me!  Damn junkie!  No, give me that! Too late! This is going down the toilet.
#unknown Watch it go! No, that's worth 40 grand, you stupid shit.
#unknown It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.
#unknown Get off the toilet.
#unknown Get off the toilet! Get off the toilet! Stop it! No! No way! What the hell do you think you're going?  Back off, man! Jesus!  We've got work to do! No, you got work to do.
#unknown I did my part.
#unknown You mean that obscenity that I spent the last two hours cleaning up?  That is your contribution?  Yo! Kiss my pink ass, man! I didn't ask for any of this! How am I supposed to live here now, huh? My whole house smells like toe cheese and dry cleaning.
#unknown Because you didn't follow my instructions! Oh, well, heil Hitler, bitch.
#unknown And let me tell you something else.
#unknown We flipped a coin, okay? You and me.
#unknown You and me! Coin flip is sacred.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin.
#unknown Fucking do it already.
#unknown That's what she said.
#unknown Yeah, I think we have some of those.
#unknown Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown 7½, maybe.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown Do you have these in black? Anyway, so like I was saying, I went to the party the other night.
#unknown Yeah, Tony was there.
#unknown Hey, where have you been? I called you two hours ago.
#unknown Sorry, baby.
#unknown I'm kinda busy here.
#unknown What's up? Kind of a lot, actually, and it's a delicate subject, so I need you to focus and Hey, sit down! Sit down! Damn it, Hank.
#unknown Well, sorry, babe.
#unknown I'm just I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
#unknown Sit down! Sit your ass down! Comprende? You, too! Sit down! Siéntete! I'm back, baby.
#unknown What's up? Walter Jr.
#unknown Yeah, what about him? Marijuana.
#unknown He's smoking it.
#unknown Bullshit.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown His own mother seems to think so.
#unknown Skyler told you that?  She inferred it.
#unknown She inferred it, huh? She strongly inferred it, like "Doctor, my friend suffers from erectile dysfunction.
#unknown " Please, come on already.
#unknown I want you to talk to him.
#unknown Walt should.
#unknown Skyler, better yet.
#unknown She'll kick his butt up and down the block.
#unknown I think it ought to be you.
#unknown You know, tell him some horror stories.
#unknown Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.
#unknown What, autopsy for a pot overdose? Come on.
#unknown I don't know, baby.
#unknown It's just that, you know I figure his dad should be the one doing this thing, don't you think? Hank, he respects you.
#unknown Yeah, all right.
#unknown Well, listen, I'll swing by their place after work.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Scare him straight.
#unknown Where's my sugar? Excuse me, ma'am.
#unknown Ma'am.
#unknown You need to be wearing footies before you try those on.
#unknown I'm extremely clean.
#unknown Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.
#unknown Hey, sorry about that.
#unknown Yeah, I'll check.
#unknown You know, I hid a pair for you last week, gray ones, but my manager found them, and we had to put them back on the floor.
#unknown What do you think? About what? This look like a nice place? No, not really.
#unknown Think you'd like to live here? No.
#unknown You sure about that?  Yeah, pretty sure.
#unknown I thought we were going to Cold Stone Creamery.
#unknown Well, a little detour.
#unknown Figured we'd come over here and check out how the other half lives.
#unknown This here's what we call the Crystal Palace.
#unknown Now you know who lives in the palace? Methheads.
#unknown Nasty, skeevy, methheads who'd sell their grandma's coochie for a hit.
#unknown Oh, you think that's funny? That's funny, huh? Yeah.
#unknown Well, let me tell you something.
#unknown Every last one of these miserable wastes of skin got started how?  How do you think they got started?  I don't know.
#unknown What do you think it was they were all doing before they graduated to shooting meth in their? A gateway drug.
#unknown That's what we call it.
#unknown Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not, that gateway drug was marijuana.
#unknown Every time.
#unknown You understand?  Um, yeah.
#unknown So why are you telling me this? 'Cause I love you, you little bastard.
#unknown Hey, I was young once, you know? The world's a messed up place, you know? You know, there was this this one time when Hey! Hey! Hey, you! Yeah, you, princess! Get over here! Don't make me get out of the car! Check this out.
#unknown See what I'm talking about.
#unknown I ain't holdin', okay?  Did I say you could open your mouth? And hands of the car.
#unknown Other side.
#unknown Go around the other side.
#unknown Talk to my friend here.
#unknown What's your name, sweetheart?  Wendy.
#unknown Wendy, huh? How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?  I ain't doing him.
#unknown He's a kid.
#unknown Jesus, was that my question? Don't think so hard.
#unknown It's gonna hurt your brain.
#unknown Are you on the pipe or the needle? Nothing.
#unknown Neither.
#unknown Show us your teeth, huh? Come on, Wendy, let's see those pearly whites.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown See that? Pipe.
#unknown Definitely.
#unknown Big time.
#unknown Big time on the pipe.
#unknown You got something you wanna ask Wendy?  No, not really.
#unknown You ever smoke anything else, Wendy? Sausages don't count.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown Tell my friend here how you got started.
#unknown You probably used to be, what, like, a Girl Scout  or probably sang in a church choir?  What are you, like, handicapped? He broke his leg playing football.
#unknown He's a QB.
#unknown Got an arm like a howitzer.
#unknown So tell me, Wendy, do you smoke pot?  Why, you got some?  All right.
#unknown Hoof it.
#unknown Get lost.
#unknown Get out of here.
#unknown Hey, fair warning! Next time I'm gonna bust you! So what do you think? Cool.
#unknown Shut the door.
#unknown Lock it.
#unknown Lock it.
#unknown Who the hell was that? A cop and some football player messing with me.
#unknown They ask about me? Huh? No.
#unknown I think they just wanted pot.
#unknown Oh, shit.
#unknown I left my root beer.
#unknown LET HIM LIVE IT'S THE MORAL THING TO DO WON'T BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF MURDER IS WRONG! KILL HIM, HE'LL KILL YOU ENTIRE FAMILY IF YOU LET HIM GO Hello.
#unknown Hey, sweetie, it's me.
#unknown Listen, I'm so sorry.
#unknown The time, it just completely got away from me there.
#unknown My fault.
#unknown My fault.
#unknown Bogdan just kept me here late, you know, doing some inventory, and I've I should have just You know, you're right.
#unknown I gotta learn to say, you know, no! But, um Sky? You there? You're at the car wash? Yeah.
#unknown I seriously doubt that, since you quit two weeks ago.
#unknown I called Bogdan, looking for you.
#unknown Quite an earful he gave me.
#unknown Listen Listen, I'll come home, and we'll talk about it.
#unknown I don't think so, Walt.
#unknown Honey.
#unknown Wherever you are why don't you just stay there tonight? Skyler? Skyler? Skyler? Walter! Kind of hungry down here! Damn.
#unknown I didn't think you were coming back.
#unknown How long was I out? I've never seen someone knock themselves out just by coughing.
#unknown You breathe in the same thing you used on me? I've got lung cancer.
#unknown I'll go make you another sandwich.
#unknown It's safe.
#unknown There's no poison.
#unknown Yeah? Because that'd be the way to do it if you're gonna do it.
#unknown I suppose it would.
#unknown I mean, you being a chemist and all.
#unknown So that name Krazy8 Do I really have to call you that? I mean, no offense, but don't you have a real name? Domingo.
#unknown Domingo.
#unknown That's "Sunday," right? I'd rather call you that, if you don't mind.
#unknown Yeah, whatever.
#unknown I can't say I ever liked it much.
#unknown So, Domingo are you from around town here or someplace else? Walter, you getting to know me is not gonna make it easier for you to kill me.
#unknown Not that I mind, you understand.
#unknown You know, you keep telling me that I don't have it in me.
#unknown Well, maybe.
#unknown But maybe not.
#unknown I sure as hell am looking for any reason not to.
#unknown I mean, any good reason at all.
#unknown Sell me.
#unknown Tell me what it is.
#unknown I guess I'd start off by promising that, if you let me go, I won't come after you.
#unknown That you'd be safe.
#unknown I guess I'd say what happened between us never happened.
#unknown And what's best for both parties is we forget all about it.
#unknown But you know that anybody in my situation would make promises like that.
#unknown And though in my case they happen to be true, you'd never know for sure.
#unknown So what else can I tell you? I don't know.
#unknown But you gotta convince me.
#unknown And you're going nowhere until you do.
#unknown Hey, yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm from here in town, man.
#unknown ABQ.
#unknown Born and bred.
#unknown Never left.
#unknown Studied business administration over at UNM, got my degree.
#unknown Really? Does that come in handy in the drug trade? It doesn't hurt.
#unknown I was gonna study music originally.
#unknown Maybe even try out for Oberlin or Berklee.
#unknown My pops talked me out of it.
#unknown Said there was no money in it unless I wind up some bullshit rock star, and I didn't have a snowball chance of that, man.
#unknown What does your dad do? He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown I know that place.
#unknown Wait a minute.

#unknown It was Don't let shopping Strain your braino Just sing this short refraino Our forniture is bueno Tampico is the nameo.
#unknown Pretty moronic.
#unknown But what can you do? It did tend to stick in your head.
#unknown Did you write that, being the musician of the family? Hell, no, man.
#unknown It was my crazy Uncle Alex.
#unknown He sings it at bars, trying to pick up on women.
#unknown In his mind, it's like saying, "I wrote Stairway to Heaven.
#unknown " Wait a minute.
#unknown Tampico Furniture.
#unknown I think when my son was born that we bought his bassinet there.
#unknown We don't sell bassinets there.
#unknown It's more of a specialty item.
#unknown We did use to sell cribs.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Well, a crib, then, okay? Crib.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown No, I remember that.
#unknown In fact, I remember recognizing your dad from those commercials.
#unknown Although he wasn't anywhere near as friendly in real life.
#unknown Yeah, no shit.
#unknown Did he try selling you that extended warranty? Yeah, he probably did.
#unknown And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.
#unknown Yeah, that was his big thing.
#unknown You ask him for a glass of water, he'll tell you you need an extended warranty on the ice.
#unknown So did you work there, too?  Only my whole life, up until the day I said "fuck you" and quit.
#unknown So, uh would you have been? It was after school.
#unknown Trust me, I was there.
#unknown Might have even helped ring you up.
#unknown You and your extended warranty on the crib.
#unknown Small world.
#unknown That it is.
#unknown The paths we take, huh? You Jesse know you got cancer? No one but you.
#unknown Not your family? No.
#unknown Why not? Not a conversation I'm even remotely ready to have.
#unknown That's why you're cooking meth? You want to leave money for your family.
#unknown Hell, I'll write you a check right now if you let me go.
#unknown Like I said, Walter, this line of work doesn't suit you, man.
#unknown Get out before it's too late.
#unknown I don't know what to do.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You do.
#unknown I'll get the key.
#unknown No, don't do this.
#unknown Don't do this.
#unknown Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? You're doing the right thing, Walter.
#unknown Do you want to So you're not angry? How do you mean? Angry? No.
#unknown Live and let live, man.
#unknown That's very understanding.
#unknown Whatever, man.
#unknown I just want to go home.

#unknown Very important stuff.
#unknown So what do you think?  It's a cook site.
#unknown Gotta be.
#unknown Nobody came way the hell out here just to buy.
#unknown Fire there could have started by accident.
#unknown Don't look like it was meant to destroy evidence.
#unknown Got a couple of Dually tracks headed away towards the road.
#unknown So, what, they're in some kind of camper/lab.
#unknown They accidentally start a fire, and everybody F.
#unknown O.
#unknown 's? Yeah, why not? Except why would that little hairgelled shit leave his car? Iyiyi, Gomie! It's a culture in decline.
#unknown It's a rich and vibrant culture.
#unknown It's a car that jumps up and down.
#unknown What the hell? You people used to be conquistadors, for Christ's sake.
#unknown Smells like a Drakkar Noir factory in here.
#unknown I already searched it.
#unknown You're wasting your time.
#unknown Give it up.
#unknown If this here's a trap car, it's gonna take more than your dumb white ass to find it.
#unknown You are talking to the trap car master, my friend.
#unknown I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.
#unknown Yeah, you're like Rain Man.
#unknown Retarded.
#unknown Yeah, baby.
#unknown Hello, Zippy.
#unknown Asshole! I'd say that looks like meth, but it's it's too damn white.
#unknown You know what I'm thinking, Gomie.
#unknown Somebody croaked our snitch.
#unknown Hey, agents! You got something? I don't know.
#unknown Just Doesn't it seem like something's missing? What about the soul? The soul.
#unknown There's nothing but chemistry here.

#unknown There's something I have to tell you.
#unknown
