#unknown I know how busy Mr.
#unknown and Mrs.
#unknown Schwartz are.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown This should make one hell of a story.
#unknown Goodbye.
#unknown I'm just saying it's apples and oranges.
#unknown Listen, I maintain, if if if I want pizza,  I go to a pizza place.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown If I want Thai, I go I go to a Thai place.
#unknown I mean, what is the what is the earthly point Did I marry you? in comparing pizza to Thai food? What has happened to your intelligence?  This is different.
#unknown They're completely Oh, come on, are you the man I married? I am the guy who wants to end this ridiculous conversation, kick off my shoes, and have a very large glass of wine.
#unknown Well, I'm gonna tell you to be my guest.
#unknown All right, wait.
#unknown The answer is  No.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes, because it has history.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Prohibition.
#unknown The sweet smell of success.
#unknown And per se has Thomas Keller.
#unknown Game, set, and match.
#unknown The whole vibe is so Yountville.
#unknown You transplant it to Manhattan,  it starts to feel  You could transplant it to Islamabad, I would still eat there.
#unknown Ooh, there's a good thought.
#unknown What, Islamabad?  No, Napa.
#unknown We have to go to Napa.
#unknown Oh, my God, all this talk of food.
#unknown Do you think Juana left us anything? No, I don't think so, she thought that we were coming back on Wednesday.
#unknown Unless you told her otherwise.
#unknown No, I haven't talked to her.
#unknown Oh, look, here.
#unknown Just a pear, that'll be perfect.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You wanna get us a nice bottle of wine? Mmhmm.
#unknown Do you think we have any of those what are those crackers with the, like, the sundried tomato and then they were kind of slightly peppery, but not too peppery.
#unknown We don't have them? I don't know.
#unknown Ask Juana.
#unknown We haven't had them in forever.
#unknown I don't know why she doesn't get those anymore.
#unknown Why don't you talk to her? I don't know, she's got that thing going on with her daughter.
#unknown Anyway, Napa? Yeah? How long is it since we've been there? Two years, Thanksgiving.
#unknown Jesus, that's two years.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Too long, right?  Is this okay? Oh, that looks perfecto.
#unknown You wanna get the fireplace?  Is it good?  Mmhmm.
#unknown Is it ripe?  Mmhmm.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You know, we could invite George and Delores, they could come up from Marin.
#unknown And Bill and Miriam Cohen.
#unknown We could have a little spa action, right? And then we could do some sort of wine, and then Aah! Hello, Gretchen.
#unknown Elliott.
#unknown I really like your new house.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown This Are we looking east? Oh.
#unknown My God, you must have one great view of the Sangre De Cristos.
#unknown Walt, what what are you doing here? I saw you on Charlie Rose.
#unknown You looked great.
#unknown You both did.
#unknown If you are here to to hurt us Walt, whatever it is you're planning Actually, I'm here to give you something.
#unknown It's out in my car.
#unknown How about the three of us take a walk to it? It's just parked down the road.
#unknown I couldn't get it past your gate.
#unknown Elliott, if we're gonna go that way, you'll need a bigger knife.
#unknown Keep stacking.
#unknown It'll all fit.
#unknown That's all right.
#unknown Just just throw it on top.
#unknown Gretchen, would you mind? We don't want to lose any under the furniture.
#unknown All right.
#unknown That is $9,720,000.
#unknown Where did it come from? And why is it here? I earned it, and you're going to give it to my children.
#unknown What? Why? Walt, I don't think we On my son's 18th birthday, which is ten months and two days from today, you will give him this money in the form of an irrevocable trust.
#unknown You will tell him that it is his to do with as he sees fit, but with the hope that he uses it for his college education.
#unknown And for the betterment of his family.
#unknown Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.
#unknown Why, uh, I mean, why, in particular, would we If you wanna give your kids drug money, go do it yourself.
#unknown I can't.
#unknown My wife and son hate me.
#unknown They won't take my money.
#unknown Even if they did, the federal government wouldn't let them.
#unknown But two rich benefactors, who are known for their charitable endeavors, who would think nothing of, for instance, writing a $28 million check to help victims of methamphetamine abuse? I have to think that your money would be very welcome.
#unknown It wouldn't make any sense coming from us.
#unknown It certainly would.
#unknown My children are blameless victims of their monstrous father.
#unknown A man who you once knew quite well.
#unknown Call it a beau geste, call it liberal guilt, call it whatever you want, but do it.
#unknown And you are not to spend a single dime of your own money.
#unknown If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed, you will take it right from here.
#unknown They use my money, never yours.
#unknown Okay, Walt, sure.
#unknown That that sounds reasonable.
#unknown So what happens next? I guess we shake on it, and I leave.
#unknown I can trust you to do this.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Absolutely you can.
#unknown Oh! Don't move.
#unknown Don't Don't dare move a muscle.
#unknown You don't want them to think that you're trying to get away.
#unknown Just breathe.
#unknown Just this afternoon, I had an extra $200,000 that I would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table.
#unknown Instead, I gave it to the two best hitmen west of the Mississippi.
#unknown Now, whatever happens to me tomorrow, they'll still be out there.
#unknown Keeping tabs.
#unknown And if, for any reason, that my children do not get this money, a kind of countdown will begin.
#unknown Maybe a day or so later, maybe a week, a year, when you're going for a walk in Santa Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever, and you're talking about your stock prices without a worry in the world.
#unknown And then suddenly, you'll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you, but before you can even turn around,  pop!  Aah! Darkness.
#unknown Cheer up, beautiful people.
#unknown This is where you get to make it right.
#unknown Oh, yeah, right.
#unknown You know, I don't exactly know how to feel about all this.
#unknown For real, yo.
#unknown Whole thing felt kinda shady, you know, like, moralitywise? Totally.
#unknown How do you feel now? Better.
#unknown Yeah, definitely improving.
#unknown What's this I hear about blue meth still being out there? What do you mean? Have you heard anything? Is it still being sold? Yeah.
#unknown By whom? It's you, right? I mean, aren't you still cooking? Damn, man.
#unknown We were sure it was you, because that shit is choice, yo.
#unknown Better than ever.
#unknown I mean, um, you know.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Seriously? You said he moved to Alaska.
#unknown That's what I heard.
#unknown Right on, Jesse.
#unknown Passing the torch.
#unknown Damn, man, couldn't he at least throw a brother a bone? Wow, what happened there? It's my birthday.
#unknown Yeah? Well, happy birthday.
#unknown It's easy money.
#unknown Until we catch you.
#unknown Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ridealong.
#unknown You can watch us knock down a meth lab, huh? Get a little excitement in your life.
#unknown Someday.
#unknown Welcome to The Grove.
#unknown Would you like to see a menu? No, thank you.
#unknown Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
#unknown All right, you got it.
#unknown Hey, how you doing? Good.
#unknown How's things? Hey, I like your shirt.
#unknown My blouse? Nice, yeah, the color.
#unknown That's a nice color on you.
#unknown It's kind of a I don't know exactly what you'd call it.
#unknown It's kind of a cornflower.
#unknown Before you say or do anything, just hear me out.
#unknown Todd Nobody knows that I'm here.
#unknown Just listen for two minutes and then I'll leave.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Just two minutes of your time.
#unknown That's all I ask.
#unknown Please.
#unknown You're running out of methylamine, aren't you? I can do the math.
#unknown You've been at it long enough.
#unknown You must be running low.
#unknown I have a new method that requires no methylamine.
#unknown And it's easy, and it will keep you in business.
#unknown And Todd, I could teach it to you.
#unknown How did you know to find us here? every Tuesday morning, you and I met here.
#unknown You're rather scheduleoriented, I guess.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown I need the money.
#unknown I've spent almost all of mine.
#unknown Already, just trying to stay one step ahead of the police.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, I don't think there's How much would it cost us? Nothing short of a million, and believe me, for this, that is is giving it away.
#unknown I think Jack should hear this.
#unknown Yeah, I don't know.
#unknown Now listen, I can I can come up there tonight and talk to him.
#unknown He'd get it.
#unknown This is a winwin situation.
#unknown Hi, what can I get for you two? He's just leaving.
#unknown Good seeing you again.
#unknown Take care.
#unknown For you? I'm good.
#unknown And I need more stevia.
#unknown Okay, no disrespect to the man, but doing business with him? Right now, that's not Of course, we're not doing business with him.
#unknown Todd, please.
#unknown Don't make me walk you through this.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Did you look at him? You'd be doing him a favor.
#unknown Hello, please record after the tone.
#unknown Truce, all right? Skyler, I have news about Walt, and you need to hear it immediately, so if you're there, pick up.
#unknown Skyler Hey.
#unknown What's up? Walt's in town.
#unknown Yeah? That car they thought he stole in New Hampshire, they found it in a Denny's parking lot right on Central.
#unknown And your old nextdoor neighbor, the one on the right, what's her name, Becky? Becky's on the left.
#unknown Carol's on the right.
#unknown Becky, Carol, whatever.
#unknown She saw him at your old house.
#unknown Just this morning, plain as day.
#unknown He's there, walking out of your house, and he calls her by name.
#unknown He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!" Or Carol, whatever.
#unknown She said he looked exactly like the Unabomber, but she's positive it was him.
#unknown Skyler, we're getting calls from all over town.
#unknown He's here, he's there, he's going to blow up city hall.
#unknown Apparently he has some sort of manifesto.
#unknown He wants to be on the six o'clock news.
#unknown It's just  Who's making these calls, him? There are two or three different voices.
#unknown They're not sure if they're crank calls or people he's put up to it or if they're actual anonymous tips.
#unknown And it's stretching them thin, which is maybe the point.
#unknown As far as I'm concerned, and I've told them this, there are three places that he would go.
#unknown To you, to me, or Flynn.
#unknown Right.
#unknown They're watching the high school.
#unknown They're probably watching your place, too.
#unknown I mean, I know that's what Hank would do.
#unknown There's no way Walt's getting to you.
#unknown They are absolutely going to catch him.
#unknown No doubt about it.
#unknown That arrogant asshole thinks he's some criminal mastermind, but he's not.
#unknown But on the offchance Yeah.
#unknown On the milliontoone chance you be on the lookout, okay? Thanks.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Five minutes.
#unknown Five minutes.
#unknown You didn't kill anybody sneaking in here, did you? You didn't hurt anybody? No.
#unknown Didn't have to.
#unknown You look terrible.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown But I feel good.
#unknown So talk.
#unknown Why are you here? It's over.
#unknown And I needed a proper goodbye.
#unknown Not our last phone call.
#unknown So you're going to the police? They'll be coming to me.
#unknown If you're in custody, what stops those people from coming back, those people you worked with? When when I still had the house, three men came in the middle of the night, wearing masks, threatening Holly and Flynn and me.
#unknown They told me not to talk about that woman I saw at the car wash, and if you're in custody and they find out They're not coming back.
#unknown Not after tonight.
#unknown What's tonight? We don't want your money, Walt.
#unknown I thought Flynn made that clear.
#unknown He did.
#unknown And I don't have any to give you.
#unknown I spent the last of it getting here.
#unknown All I have to give you is this.
#unknown Call the DEA once I leave.
#unknown Tell them I was here.
#unknown That I forced my way in.
#unknown Tell them Tell them I wanted bacon and eggs on my birthday, and that I gave you that ticket.
#unknown Those numbers are GPS coordinates.
#unknown For what? A burial site.
#unknown That's where they'll find Hank and Steve Gomez.
#unknown That's where I buried our money.
#unknown The men who stole it from us, the men who still have it, they murdered Hank and Steve and put them in that hole.
#unknown Now you trade that for a deal with the prosecutor.
#unknown You get yourself out of this.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown All the things that I did, you need to understand If I have to hear one more time that you did this for the family I did it for me.
#unknown I liked it.
#unknown I was good at it.
#unknown And I was really I was alive.
#unknown Flynn will be home soon.
#unknown Before I go may I see her? Whoo.
#unknown Damn man, this thing's a classic.
#unknown What block you got in it? Couldn't tell you.
#unknown That's the one you want.
#unknown No replacement for displacement.
#unknown Where to? To the clubhouse.
#unknown Just go ahead, just park it right in front over here.
#unknown No, no, no, just straight in, man, just, what are All right, fine, here, whatever.
#unknown Hey, how you doing? Turn around, put your arms out like this.
#unknown While you're at it, why don't you lift your shirt up? Give us a spin.
#unknown Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.
#unknown Okay? My wallet and keys? Yeah, you'll get them back.
#unknown Just relax.
#unknown Stay here.
#unknown Keep your eyes open.
#unknown Jesus, look at you with that head of hair.
#unknown Is that real? Yes.
#unknown That's not a wig? Seriously? No.
#unknown What were you doing before, shaving it? Yes.
#unknown Christ, that is one fine head of hair.
#unknown I mean, otherwise you look like shit, but Hello to you too, Jack.
#unknown Can we talk business? I don't think so, no.
#unknown Did Todd tell you what I'm offering? Yeah, he told me.
#unknown Thing is, we're not really in the market.
#unknown You're running low on methylamine, what happens then? No, we'll get more.
#unknown That Quayle woman's got her own setup.
#unknown The heat's off her.
#unknown She can break loose a barrel every now and again.
#unknown It ain't broke, so why fix it? Todd, please, would you explain things to your uncle? Explain to him the benefit of what I'm offering.
#unknown You really shouldn't have come back, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Jack.
#unknown Where do you want it? Well, gee, I don't know, anywhere but my living room? Take him out back.
#unknown Jack, you owe me.
#unknown Hey, come on.
#unknown You owe me.
#unknown Hey, hey, hey.
#unknown I owe you, what for? Jesse Pinkman, you promised that you would kill him, and you didn't.
#unknown Instead, you partnered with him.
#unknown You're his partner now Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.
#unknown Partners, what are you talking about? He's alive, isn't he? He's cooking for you.
#unknown What, are you gonna lie? Him being alive is not him and me being partners.
#unknown Not by a damn sight.
#unknown What, you think I'd partner with a rat? Where's that little piece of shit? He's finishing up a batch.
#unknown Well, go get him.
#unknown Bring him here.
#unknown Uncle Jack  No.
#unknown No, no, no.
