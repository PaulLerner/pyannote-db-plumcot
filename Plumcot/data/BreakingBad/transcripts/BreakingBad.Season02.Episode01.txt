#unknown What is this? It's blue.
#unknown We used a different chemical process, but it is every bit as pure.
#unknown It may be blue, but it's the bomb.
#unknown Tight, tight, tight.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man, just keep bringing me that.
#unknown You're all right.
#unknown We're gonna make a lot of money together.
#unknown Just remember who you're working for.
#unknown What did you say? I'm just saying, they gotta know that they're working for you.
#unknown Like they don't already know that? Are you saying that they're stupid? No, I'm just saying.
#unknown Okay, so you're not saying that they're stupid? So I don't understand.
#unknown Are you saying that I'm stupid? Is that it? Is that what you're doing? Tuco.
#unknown Tuco.
#unknown Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh? Heisenberg says relax.
#unknown I'm relaxed.
#unknown I'm relaxed.
#unknown I'm rela Damn, man! Look at that! Look! Yeah, that's messed up.
#unknown Okay, Heisenberg.
#unknown Next week.

#unknown Good state college, adjusting for inflation say, $45,000 a year.
#unknown Two kids, four years of college, $360,000.
#unknown Remaining mortgage on the home, Home equity line, 30,000.
#unknown That's 137,000.
#unknown Cost of living, food, clothing, utilities say, 2 grand a month.
#unknown I mean, that should put a dent in it, anyway.
#unknown Twentyfour K a year, provide for, say, 10 years.
#unknown That's $240,000.
#unknown Plus 360, plus 137.
#unknown Seven thirtyseven.
#unknown Seven hundred and thirtyseven thousand.
#unknown That's what I need.
#unknown That is what I need.
#unknown You and I both clear about 70 grand a week.
#unknown That's only 10 and half more weeks.
#unknown Call it 11.
#unknown Eleven more drug deals, and always in a public place from now on.
#unknown It's doable.
#unknown Definitely doable.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Stop, stop, stop.
#unknown Heisenberg! What the hell? What's wrong with him? What's the matter with you? You can't take an assbeating, bitch? Oh, damn, Tuco.
#unknown Shut up! There's no pulse.
#unknown Do something.
#unknown Do something? He needs an ambulance.
#unknown He needs a hospital.
#unknown Do something! You're smart, right? Do that Do that thing.
#unknown No, there's not There's nothing.
#unknown Breathe into his mouth.
#unknown No, they don't teach that anymore.
#unknown It doesn't work.
#unknown You, come here.
#unknown Breathe into his mouth.
#unknown No.
#unknown Get rid of him.
#unknown Look, Tuco, we can't do him like that, man.
#unknown Buzzards and rats and all that.
#unknown I'm just saying, you know? It's not very Christian.
#unknown That sounds like arguing.
#unknown Gonzo, hurry up.
#unknown What's the big hurry? Oh, I.
#unknown I just think we're done here.
#unknown Oh, yeah? You're done.
#unknown Hey, I'm back here.
#unknown Hello? Are already married Hello? Thank you to our viewers Hey.
#unknown The crash happened as rush hour began around 8 a.
#unknown m.
#unknown Walt? Didn't you hear me? Walt.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey yourself.
#unknown What, you can't answer when I'm calling you? Are you okay? Great.
#unknown New hat? Yeah.
#unknown I got some chicken at Albertson's.
#unknown Do you want me to heat some up for you? But they can occasionally adapt to other local areas  lik e airports, golf courses Where've you been? What is? What are you doing? Okay.
#unknown You know what? I've got all this crap on my face.

#unknown Okay.
#unknown Yeah, just.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Enough.
#unknown Hold up.
#unknown Stop it.
#unknown Stop it! I know you're scared and you're angry and frustrated.
#unknown And I know none of this is fair.
#unknown But you cannot take it out on me.
#unknown Hey, I'm home.
#unknown Oh, we are dead.
#unknown Dead, man.
#unknown Ruto or rute or however the hell you This is conjecture.
#unknown This is conjecture? Conjecture isn't helping.
#unknown Conjecture? We need to state the facts.
#unknown Okay, fine.
#unknown Facts, then.
#unknown Fact A: My phone rang eight times last night.
#unknown Dead air, hang ups every time.
#unknown Second fact: Like 3 in the morning I saw that Caddy of his cruising my neighbourhood.
#unknown If he wanted to kill us, he would've at the junkyard.
#unknown What is that, conjecture? Are you basing that on that he's got a normal, healthy brain or something? Did you not see him beat a dude to death for, like, nothing? And that way That way he just kept staring at us saying, "You're done.
#unknown " "You're done"? You know what that means? I will tell you what that means.
#unknown That means exactly how it sounds, yo.
#unknown All right.
#unknown We are witnesses.
#unknown We are loose ends.
#unknown Right now, Tuco's thinking, "Yeah, hey they cook good meth, but can I trust them?" What happens when he decides " no"? No.
#unknown It is him or us.
#unknown You understand? It is him or us! How would you do it? What do you mean, how? Specifically, how would you do it? Step by step.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Say we set up one last sale.
#unknown This is providing he doesn't decide to waste us before then.
#unknown Every time we bring in a new batch, he always tests the product, right? So as his head is down, you know, giving it a snort, just: So three shots? Three shots or, I don't know, two.
#unknown Wait, is it two, or is it three? Two would probably work, I guess.
#unknown Okay, two shots.
#unknown Two in the chest, in the face? I'm just trying to understand how this works.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right, we'll put a pin in that.
#unknown But by now, the big guy, Gonzo he's probably coming at you, right? Yeah.
#unknown You turn toward him.
#unknown Yeah, just wheel on him How many shots for him? He's a big guy.
#unknown How many shots does that take? I don't know.
#unknown Three shots.
#unknown Three shots.
#unknown Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
#unknown Two men down.
#unknown Now, is there anyone else there? I mean, Tuco is usually with someone else, right? Maybe even a couple of guys.
#unknown His dealers, his posse.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So we'll put a pin in that one too.
#unknown At this point, how many shots fired? You've gotta be running low.
#unknown How many bullets does that gun take? It's not How can you suggest that we kill a man and you can't even open the gun? It's not that easy, is it? Hey, man, Walt, you did it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Call Skyler.
#unknown Hey, there.
#unknown You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Jr.
#unknown We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message.
#unknown Well, aren't you early bird, up and out already? The big lug and I are gonna go try that new restaurant over by UNM tonight so let me know if you guys wanna hang.
#unknown Listen to me.
#unknown " Hang.
#unknown " Walt Jr.
#unknown will be proud.
#unknown I know the lingo.
#unknown I'm still hip.
#unknown It's Chinese.
#unknown The restaurant.
#unknown I don't know, I just feel like Chinese.
#unknown Do you think that people in China ever just feel like American? You know, and they go out and get little takeout boxes with mashed potatoes and meat loaf and try and figure out how to use the little knives and forks? I wonder if that ever happens.
#unknown All right, I'll let you go.
#unknown So call me.
#unknown Skyler didn't pick up? Obviously she's not home.
#unknown Baby.
#unknown Baby, wait up.
#unknown Hey, what was that about Chinese? Dinner tonight.
#unknown That new place.
#unknown How late they serve? I don't know.
#unknown You got Dave at 8.
#unknown Not tonight.
#unknown Yeah, you do.
#unknown Remember? No, that's Thursday.
#unknown Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's Thursday.
#unknown Remember how at the last minute they changed it? They were gonna charge us a penalty.
#unknown Look, baby, you only got six more sessions.
#unknown And I'm doing them, Hank.
#unknown I said I would do them, and I'm doing them.
#unknown I can't help it if you got your days of the week wrong.
#unknown Look out.
#unknown Sorry, Mr.
#unknown Schrader.
#unknown Look, it's.
#unknown You know, it's just.
#unknown Oh, boy.
#unknown I.
#unknown I think Dave is really helping you.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Sorry about that.
#unknown She's.
#unknown Hey! Hey, where's my phone call? Hits two in the sand, two in the forest and then he says, "Give me a four.
#unknown " Hey, Gomez.
#unknown Gomez? What do you got for me? Come on.
#unknown Chopchop.
#unknown Good morning to you too.
#unknown A.
#unknown P.
#unknown D.
#unknown sent this over.
#unknown This was about eight or 10 days ago.
#unknown You know Southwest Aniline, right? Yeah, off the 25? The place smells like feet.
#unknown This is them.
#unknown Check this out.
#unknown Holy shit.
#unknown What was that? Thermite.
#unknown So they tell me.
#unknown Burns about 5000 degrees.
#unknown Kind of stuff you see on a James Bond movie.
#unknown Nice.
#unknown Guys who know their trade.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown I take that back.
#unknown What, they didn't think about stealing a hand truck? Hey, try rolling it, morons.
#unknown It's a barrel.
#unknown It rolls.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown So, what'd they get? Methylamine, 30 gallons.
#unknown P2P? They're cooking old school biker meth.
#unknown Who the hell still does that? All the oldtimers I know are either dead or in prison.
#unknown Pseudo's in short supply so these two make do by changing up the formula.
#unknown That and the thermite I'd say these two know their chemistry.
#unknown But ranking them as burglars? Shit.
#unknown I wouldn't trust these two to break into the Special Olympics.
#unknown They got book learning but no street skills.
#unknown Maybe they're college kids.
#unknown Chem students trying to make a big score.
#unknown Yeah, maybe.
#unknown I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor.
#unknown That big a score, they're gonna wind up stepping on some toes.
#unknown Tell you what, they better pray it's us who catches up to them and not those boys from Juarez.
#unknown Your daughter wants out.
#unknown Hey there.
#unknown You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter Jr.
#unknown We can't come to the phone, so please leave us a message.
#unknown Hey, it's me.
#unknown Thought I'd try you earlier before you go out and, you know, face the day.
#unknown I'm realising now  it probably tak es you a little longer to get to the phone  owing to the extra baby weight Hey, sweetie.
#unknown Walt, did you spend the entire night out here? No.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Well, not all of it.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown I did have a touch of My stomach, you know.
#unknown I knew I was gonna be up and down, so I just didn't wanna wake you.
#unknown How would he know where I live? You sure it was Tuco? Who else could it be? Did you ever tell him my name? No.
#unknown Did you tell him where I live or anything? No.
#unknown What about Gonzo, or the dead one? Did you tell them anything? I didn't say jack.
#unknown Okay, Tuco must've put out, like, you know, feelers.
#unknown He's got his ways and means, yo.
#unknown Sources, all right? He's closing in.
#unknown And what happens when he finds out that my brotherinlaw is a DEA agent? Oh, God.
#unknown What happens then? Look, it's got five bullets.
#unknown I finally figured out how to.
#unknown Look, I just finally I figured it out.
#unknown I say we get a second gun, right? For you.
#unknown I mean, don't we, like, double our chances? I mean, mathematically.
#unknown I've got a better idea.
#unknown Thank God.
#unknown All right.
#unknown What is it, Mr.
#unknown White? Lay it on me.
#unknown Beans.
#unknown Beans? They're castor beans.
#unknown So, what are we gonna do with them? Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk? Climb it and escape? We are going to process them into ricin.
#unknown Rice and beans? Ricin.
#unknown It's an extremely effective poison.
#unknown It's toxic in small doses.
#unknown Also fairly easy to overlook during an autopsy.
#unknown All right.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So Don't touch them.
#unknown You can get poisoned from beans? Yes.
#unknown Back in the late '70s, ricin was used to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.
#unknown The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella to inject a tiny pellet into the man's leg.
#unknown And we're talking about an amount not bigger than the head of a pin.
#unknown But it It killed him? Oh, yes.
#unknown Now we just need to figure out a delivery device and then no more Tuco.
#unknown Hey, Sky.
#unknown Hey, Hank.
#unknown How you doing? Is this.
#unknown This a bad time? No, come on in.
#unknown I should've called first.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown What can I do for you? Maybe we ought You wanna sit down first? I don't know, Hank.
#unknown Depends on whether or not this is gonna be about Marie.
#unknown Did she send you? Hell, no.
#unknown She's barely even talking to me.
#unknown That's why I'm here, okay? Selfpreservation.
#unknown Big time.
#unknown Look I know you gals have your ups and downs.
#unknown I get it.
#unknown Gals.
#unknown And I need to get involved like I need a second hole in my ass.
#unknown But if you could do me this huge favour and just return her phone calls.
#unknown I don't think I'm quite ready to do that yet.
#unknown Communication.
#unknown Communication, right? Back and forth.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Sky, do this for me, please.
#unknown You can yell at her.
#unknown Just call her back.
#unknown Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown That baby tiara she gave me at the shower? She stole it from Gertrude Zachary's.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I almost got arrested when I went back to return it.
#unknown And Marie won't admit it.
#unknown She won't apologise.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown If I thought you were gonna return it, I would have never, you know.
#unknown You knew about this.
#unknown We're working on it.
#unknown I mean, she's got this therapist, Dave.
#unknown And I mean, Dave is really good.
#unknown Dave's good, yeah.
#unknown But it's an ongoing process, Sky and we have gotta be understanding, you know? I mean, we gotta, you know.
#unknown We gotta support the shit out of her.
#unknown Do we? Yeah.
#unknown I need support.
#unknown Me.
#unknown The almost40yearold pregnant woman with the surprise baby on the way.
#unknown And the husband with the lung cancer who disappears for hours, and I don't know where he goes.
#unknown And he barely even speaks to me anymore.
#unknown With the moody son who does the same thing.
#unknown And the overdrawn checking account.
#unknown And the lukewarm water heater that leaks rustyIooking crap and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet and we can't even afford to fix it.
#unknown But, oh, I see.
#unknown Now I'm supposed to go, " Hank, please what can I possibly do to further benefit my spoiled, kleptomaniac, bitch sister who somehow always manages to be the centre of attention?" Because God knows she's the one with the really important problems.
#unknown Want me to take a look at that utility closet? That's all it takes? That's all it takes.
#unknown So now what? Now we arrange our next meet.
#unknown In a public place this time.
#unknown Nice and safe.
#unknown Business as usual.
#unknown And after we sell him our usual four pounds, then we'll pull this out.
#unknown " By the way, Tuco, this is a new formula we've been working on.
#unknown Care to try it?" Okay, well, what's new about it? I mean, just in case he asks.
#unknown What do we say? I don't know.
#unknown Whatever you want.
#unknown It gets the user insanely high.
#unknown I mean, how much salesmanship do we really need? That degenerate snorts anything he gets his hands on.
#unknown Okay, well, we'll just put a pin in that, then.
#unknown Anyway, within the next 48 hours, maybe 72 it'll look like natural causes.
#unknown What, like a heart attack? Yeah.
#unknown Or the flu, maybe.
#unknown His associates won't know any differently and we'll be in the clear.
#unknown Not if Tuco kills us first.
#unknown Just keep it down.
#unknown Hey, Hank.
#unknown What's up? Oh, hey, buddy.
#unknown You been home yet? No.
#unknown Why? Well.
#unknown Because I really screwed up.
#unknown I apologise in advance for the earful you're gonna hear from Skyler.
#unknown I was trying to get her and Marie talking again.
#unknown Big mistak e.
#unknown I should have just kept out of it.
#unknown Yeah, well, okay.
#unknown Me and my big mouth, I guess.
#unknown Yeah, well, that You know, it happens.
#unknown It's no problem.
#unknown No worries.
#unknown Yeah, well, thanks, man.
#unknown I appreciate that.
#unknown Jesus, the wives, huh? Hank, unfortunately, I really Oh, yeah.
#unknown Hey, man, don't let me k eep you.
#unknown Actually, I'm at work, so.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown You wanna see something really freaky? Well, I would, but Seriously, Walt, this is.
#unknown You gotta check out this crime scene me and Gomie are at.
#unknown Just a second.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown Hang on.
#unknown It should be coming through right now.
#unknown Guess it could be worse, huh? Could be having a day like these two.
#unknown Couple of local bulletheads.
#unknown Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.
#unknown Walt, you there? Hey, Walt? I'm taking this.
#unknown No.
#unknown It's my gun.
#unknown I need it! No, you don't.
#unknown Not if you leave town.
#unknown Get out of here.
#unknown Tuco killing Gonzo means he's coming after us next.
#unknown I've.
#unknown I've gotta get home.
#unknown My family.
#unknown Skyler? Walter, Jr.
#unknown ? Skyler? Hey.
#unknown Where's Walter, Jr.
#unknown ? Having dinner at Louis' house.
#unknown Supposedly.
#unknown Yep.
#unknown All day, I've had the whole house to myself.
#unknown So where have you been this time? Walt? Walt? Walt, will you come in here and talk to me please? Walt! I'll be right there.
#unknown Yeah, I recognise these two knobjobs.
#unknown Known associates of a psychotic piece of shit named Tuco Salamanca.
#unknown Guess he got tired of associating.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Hey, do you mind if I get in there? No, go ahead.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown The big one smells fresher.
#unknown You guys find a death wound? I see lots of blood, but no bullet holes.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You done taking pictures? All right.
#unknown Let's lay them out flat.
#unknown Let me get out of your way here, man.
#unknown Snap.
#unknown Damn, Ricky.
#unknown Leave something for the coroner.
#unknown Oh, this is beautiful.
#unknown Hey, someone call Jay Leno.
#unknown We got the world's dumbest criminal.
#unknown This guy wasn't murdered.
#unknown Look.
#unknown Big stuff here was moving this guy's body when the stack must have shifted.
#unknown Crushed his arm, pinned him here, and he bled out.
#unknown Poetic justice.
#unknown Oh, I love it.
#unknown Don't you just? Get a photo of me with this guy, all right? Old stumpy, here.
#unknown Make sure you get the stump in there.
#unknown Walt, would you talk to me, please? I don't know where to begin.
#unknown What the hell are you doing here? Get in.
#unknown Get in.
#unknown Let's go.
#unknown
