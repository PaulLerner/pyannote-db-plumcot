skyler_white  But you cannot take it out on me.
walter_white_jr.  Hey, I'm home.
jesse_pinkman  we are dead.
jesse_pinkman  Dead, man.
jesse_pinkman  Ruto or rute or however the hell you This
walter_white  This is conjecture. This
jesse_pinkman  This is conjecture?
walter_white  Conjecture isn't helping.
jesse_pinkman  Conjecture? We need to
walter_white  state the facts. Okay
jesse_pinkman  Okay, fine
jesse_pinkman  fine. Facts,
jesse_pinkman  Fact A :
jesse_pinkman  My phone rang eight times last night.
jesse_pinkman  Dead air, hang ups every time.
jesse_pinkman  Second fact : Like 3 in the morning I saw that Caddy of his cruising my neighbourhood.
walter_white  If he wanted to kill us, he would've at the junkyard.
jesse_pinkman  What is that, conjecture?
jesse_pinkman  Are you basing that on that he's got a normal, healthy brain or something?
jesse_pinkman  Did you not see him beat a dude to death for, like, nothing?
jesse_pinkman  And that way That way he just kept staring at us saying," You're done.
jesse_pinkman " You're done"
jesse_pinkman  You know what that means?
jesse_pinkman  I will tell you what that means.
jesse_pinkman  That means exactly how it sounds, yo.
jesse_pinkman  right. We
jesse_pinkman  We are witnesses. We
jesse_pinkman  We are loose ends.
Jesse_Pinkman  Right now, Tuco's thinking," Yeah, hey they cook good meth, but can I trust them?"
jesse_pinkman  What happens when he decides" no"? No.
jesse_pinkman  It is him or us.
jesse_pinkman  You understand? It is him or us!
walter_white  How would you do it?
jesse_pinkman  do you mean, how? Specifically
walter_white  Specifically, how would you do it?
walter_white  Step by step.
jesse_pinkman  Say we set up one last sale.
jesse_pinkman  This is providing he doesn't decide to waste us before then.
jesse_pinkman  Every time we bring in a new batch, he always tests the product, right?
jesse_pinkman  So as his head is down, you know, giving it a snort, just :
jesse_pinkman  shots or, I don't know, two.
walter_white  Wait, is it two, or is it three?
jesse_pinkman  Two would probably work, I guess.
walter_white  Okay, two shots.
walter_white  Two in the chest, in the face?
walter_white  I'm just trying to understand how this works.
walter_white  right, we'll put a pin in that. But
walter_white  But by now, the big guy, Gonzo he's probably coming at you, right?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah
walter_white  Yeah. You turn toward him.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, just wheel on him
walter_white  How many shots for him?
walter_white  He's a big guy. How
walter_white  How many shots does that take? I
jesse_pinkman  I don't know. Three
jesse_pinkman  Three shots.
walter_white  Three shots. Okay
walter_white  Okay, Tuco and Gonzo. Two
walter_white  Two men down.
walter_white  Now, is there anyone else there?
walter_white  I mean, Tuco is usually with someone else, right?
walter_white  Maybe even a couple of guys.
walter_white  His dealers, his posse.
walter_white  So we'll put a pin in that one too.
walter_white  At this point, how many shots fired?
walter_white  You've gotta be running low. How
walter_white  How many bullets does that gun take?
walter_white  How can you suggest that we kill a man and you can't even open the gun?
walter_white  It's not that easy, is it?
jesse_pinkman  Hey, man, Walt, you did it.
marie_schrader  Call Skyler.
skyler_white  Hey, there.

marie_schrader  You know, and they go out and get little takeout boxes with mashed potatoes and meat loaf and try and figure out how to use the little knives and forks?

steven_gomez  All the oldtimers I know are either dead or in prison.
hank_schrader  Pseudo's in short supply so these two make do by changing up the formula.
hank_schrader  That and the thermite I'd say these two know their chemistry.
steven_gomez  But ranking them as burglars? Shit
hank_schrader  Shit. I
hank_schrader  trust these two to break into the Special Olympics.
hank_schrader  They got book learning but no street skills.

steven_gomez  Chem students trying to make a big score.
hank_schrader  Yeah, maybe.
hank_schrader  you, 30 gallons of precursor.
hank_schrader  big a score, they're gonna wind up stepping on some toes.

walter_white  No, no
walter_white  no. Well, not all of it.

walter_white  Did you ever tell him my name?
jesse_pinkman  No
walter_white  No. Did you tell him where I live or anything?

jesse_pinkman  Thank God. All
jesse_pinkman  What is it, Mr. White? Lay it
jesse_pinkman  it on me.
walter_white  Beans.
jesse_pinkman  Beans?
walter_white  castor beans.

jesse_pinkman  Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk?
jesse_pinkman  Climb it and escape?
walter_white  We are going to process them into ricin.
jesse_pinkman  Rice and beans?
walter_white  It's
walter_white  It's an extremely effective poison.
walter_white  It's toxic in small doses. Also
walter_white  Also fairly easy to overlook during an autopsy.
jesse_pinkman  All right. So Don't touch them. You can get poisoned from beans?
walter_white  Yes.
walter_white  Back in the late '70s, ricin was used to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.
walter_white  The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella to inject a tiny pellet into the man's leg.
walter_white  And we're talking about an amount not bigger than the head of a pin
jesse_pinkman  But it It killed him?
walter_white  Oh,

hank_schrader  then no more Tuco. Hey, Sky. Hey,

skyler_white  Depends on whether or not this is gonna be about Marie.
skyler_white  Did she send you?
hank_schrader  Hell, no.

hank_schrader  That's why I'm here, okay?
hank_schrader  Selfpreservation.
hank_schrader  Big time.
hank_schrader  Look I know you gals have your ups and downs.
hank_schrader  I get it.
skyler_white  Gals. And
hank_schrader  And I need to get involved like I need a second hole in my ass.

hank_schrader  Back and forth.
hank_schrader  Come on.
hank_schrader  Sky, do this for me, please.
hank_schrader  You can yell at her.
hank_schrader  Just call her
skyler_white  Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.
skyler_white  That's right.
skyler_white  That baby tiara she gave me at the shower?
skyler_white  She stole it from Gertrude Zachary's.
skyler_white  Yeah.
skyler_white  I almost got arrested when I went back to return it.
skyler_white  And Marie won't admit it
skyler_white  She won't apologise.
hank_schrader  Yeah. If
hank_schrader  I thought you were gonna return it, I would have never, you know.
skyler_white  You knew about this
hank_schrader  We're working on it.
hank_schrader  I mean, she's got this therapist, Dave.
hank_schrader  And I mean, Dave is really good. Dave's good,
skyler_white  yeah. But
hank_schrader  But it's an ongoing process, Sky and we have gotta be understanding, you know?
hank_schrader  I mean, we gotta, you know.
hank_schrader  We gotta support the shit out of her
skyler_white  need support
skyler_white  Me.
skyler_white  The almost40yearold pregnant woman with the surprise baby on the way.
skyler_white  And the husband with the lung cancer who disappears for hours, and I don't know where he goes.
skyler_white  And he barely even speaks to me anymore.
skyler_white  With the moody son who does the same thing.
skyler_white  And the overdrawn checking account.
skyler_white  And the lukewarm water heater that leaks rustyIooking crap and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet and we can't even afford to fix it.
skyler_white  But, oh, I see.
skyler_white  Now I'm supposed to go," Hank, please what can I possibly do to further benefit my spoiled, kleptomaniac, bitch sister who somehow always manages to be the centre of attention?"
skyler_white  God knows she's the one with the really important problems.
hank_schrader  Want me to take a look at that utility closet?
jesse_pinkman  That's all it takes?
walter_white  That's all it takes.
jesse_pinkman  now what
walter_white  Now we arrange our next meet.
walter_white  In a public place this time.
walter_white  Nice and safe.
walter_white  Business as
walter_white  usual. And after we sell him our usual four pounds, then we'll pull this out.
walter_white  By the way, Tuco, this is a new formula we've been working on.
walter_white  Care to try it?
jesse_pinkman  well, what's new about it?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, just in case he asks.
jesse_pinkman  What do we say? I
walter_white  I don't know.
walter_white  Whatever you want.
walter_white  It gets the user insanely high.
walter_white  mean, how much salesmanship do we really need?
walter_white  That degenerate snorts anything he gets his hands on.
jesse_pinkman  Okay, well, we'll just put a pin in that, then.
walter_white  Anyway, within the next 48 hours, maybe 72 it'll look like natural causes.
jesse_pinkman  What, like a heart attack?
walter_white  Or the flu, maybe.
walter_white  His associates won't know any differently and we'll be in the clear.
jesse_pinkman  if Tuco kills us first.
walter_white  Hey, Hank.
walter_white  What's up?
hank_schrader  Oh, hey, buddy.
hank_schrader  You been home yet
hank_schrader  Well.
hank_schrader  Because I really screwed up.
hank_schrader  apologise in advance for the earful you're gonna hear from Skyler.
hank_schrader  I was trying to get her and Marie talking again.
