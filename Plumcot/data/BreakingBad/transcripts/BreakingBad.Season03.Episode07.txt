saul_goodman  You understand Get Out of Jail Free card, right
saul_goodman  right? I mean, just blink once if you're following.
saul_goodman  The D. A. 's worst nightmare is that face out in public.
saul_goodman  They're going to have to steer a wide berth of young Master Pinkman for fear of the P. R. poop storm that will rain down on them if this story ever gets out. I

walter_white  Jesse, I'm I am so sorry for this
walter_white  should not have happened. But it did.
jesse_pinkman  No thanks to you.
walter_white  But the plan did work. We
walter_white  We would have been locked up right now if we didn't lure him away.
walter_white  But this
walter_white  this I just I never saw this coming.
walter_white  So What, uh Wwhat happens now?
jesse_pinkman  What happens now?
jesse_pinkman  I'll tell you what happens now.
jesse_pinkman  scumbag brotherinlaw is finished,
jesse_pinkman  done
jesse_pinkman  done. You understand?
jesse_pinkman  I will own him when this is over.
jesse_pinkman  Every cent he earns, every cent his wife earns, is mine.
jesse_pinkman  Anyplace he goes, anywhere he turns, I'm going to be there, grabbing my share.
jesse_pinkman  He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana for pennies, and I'll be standing over him to get my cut.
jesse_pinkman  He'll see me when he wakes up in the morning and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat hole's left for him after I shred his house down,
jesse_pinkman  I will haunt his crusty ass forever until the day he sticks a gun up his mouth and pulls the trigger just to get me out of his head.
jesse_pinkman  That's what happens next.
saul_goodman  Uh, my advice
saul_goodman  that's probably not a good strategy.
saul_goodman  they're scared of you right now.
saul_goodman  They want nothing to do with you.
saul_goodman  But if you hit them, they're forced to hit back hard.
saul_goodman  I mean, they will turn over every rock hither, thither, and yon until someone spills the beans on you and anyone associated with you, uh, present company included.
walter_white  Yeah, I think what Saul is saying makes a lot of sense.
walter_white  Jesse, move on with your life.
walter_white  Leave it behind, all of it.
jesse_pinkman  Nothing changes. Once I walk out of here,
jesse_pinkman  I get myself a new RV and go start cooking again.
walter_white  How exactly do you think you're going to get away with that?
walter_white  They will catch you.
jesse_pinkman  So what? What?
walter_white  I have
jesse_pinkman  a Get Out of Jail Free card.
saul_goodman  Hey, I may have overstated the, uh, power of your face.
jesse_pinkman  Not this.
jesse_pinkman  If the cops catch me I give them what they want the most.
jesse_pinkman  You.
jesse_pinkman  They nab me, I make a deal to give up the great Heisenberg and his milliondollar drug ring.
jesse_pinkman  You're my free pass, bitch.
saul_goodman  You're so sure.
walter_white  Look, if he didn't give up my name while Hank was beating him senseless, he's never going to talk.
saul_goodman  What do you think that was in there, a bluff?
saul_goodman  He wants your brotherinlaw.
saul_goodman  And there's going to be a parade of lawyers creaming their Underoos for a case like that.
saul_goodman  I mean, I'd take it myself if it wouldn't cause so much collateral damage.
saul_goodman  And him cooking again.
saul_goodman  Hey, when, not if, he gets caught, and he's facing 20 years, what'll he do then?
saul_goodman  Believe me, there's no honor among thieves.
saul_goodman  Except for us, of course
walter_white  he'll come around
saul_goodman  if he doesn't, there may come a time to talk options.
walter_white  Options?
hank_schrader  I'm convinced that Mr. Pinkman was involved in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl2 methamphetamine, specifically what we're calling the blue meth.
hank_schrader  tracked him to a scrap yard where he stored an early '80s camper, an RV.
hank_schrader  waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle, which I believed to be a rolling meth lab, I received a telephone call telling me my wife Marie had been injured in an accident.
hank_schrader  Upon hearing the news, I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife.
hank_schrader  arriving at the hospital, I learned the emergency call was a hoax.
hank_schrader  My wife, fortunately, was unharmed. clears throat
hank_schrader  So I immediately went back to the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.
hank_schrader  Most likely destroyed on site.
abq_dectective_#1  And it was at this point that you drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman?
union_rep  I think we're done here.
union_rep  Agent Schrader needs to get home, get some rest.
abq_dectective_#1  That's fine.
abq_dectective_#1  But just to confirm, you're taking the Fifth here?
hank_schrader  Yeah. That's correct.
abq_dectective_#2  Okay.
abq_dectective_#2  Well, we just want to GI you all a heads up.
abq_dectective_#2  Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges in this matter
abq_dectective_#2  He's given a detailed version of events as he sees them.
union_rep  The word of a meth head.
abq_dectective_#1  We know all about his history.
abq_dectective_#1  We're well aware, but toxicology on Pinkman his
abq_dectective_#1  blood is clean, he's not using.
abq_dectective_#2  kid is even refusing his doctorordered pain meds, as far as we can tell.
hank_schrader  So, um where do we go from here?
george_merkert  couple of gentlemen from OPR will come down, probably tomorrow morning.
george_merkert  Janice will give us an exact time on that.
george_merkert  And you men will be continuing your investigation,

abq_dectective_#1  We just
abq_dectective_#1  We need one more thing.
