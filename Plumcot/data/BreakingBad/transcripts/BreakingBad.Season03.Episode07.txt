#unknown [boy laughing] [boy laughs] [phone rings] [ring] [ring] Mmm.
#unknown [whistles] [screams] [screaming continues] [gasping] [sigh] [vehicle approaches] Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.
#unknown All right, you can call my lawyer, Saul Goodman.
#unknown Talk to my lawyer, all right? Hey, you hear me.
#unknown I got nothing to say.
#unknown I told you.
#unknown You can call my Ah, Christ! God! You had my cell phone number! You had my wife's name! How'd you do it? Huh? Who you working with? [grunts] If you're, uh, ready to talk, they want to get a statement.
#unknown Your side of what happened here.
#unknown Or we can hold him off till another time.
#unknown Maybe you'll want to talk to a lawyer.
#unknown There it is.
#unknown [chuckles] Yo, Adrian.
#unknown Rocky called.
#unknown He wants his face back.
#unknown [chuckles] Come on.
#unknown I got to cheer you up.
#unknown You see that? That's your Get Out of Jail Free card.
#unknown You understand Get Out of Jail Free card, right? I mean, just blink once if you're following.
#unknown [chuckles] The D.
#unknown A.
#unknown 's worst nightmare is that face out in public.
#unknown They're going to have to steer a wide berth of young Master Pinkman for fear of the P.
#unknown R.
#unknown poop storm that will rain down on them if this story ever gets out.
#unknown I mean, this this beating? Best thing for you.
#unknown You're home free.
#unknown Good, right? Right.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown You're now officially the cute one of the group.
#unknown Paul, meet Ringo.
#unknown Ringo, Paul.
#unknown This is I Jesse, I'm I am so sorry for this.
#unknown This should not have happened.
#unknown But it did.
#unknown No thanks to you.
#unknown But the plan did work.
#unknown We would have been locked up right now if we didn't lure him away.
#unknown But this this I just I never saw this coming.
#unknown So What, uh Wwhat happens now? [Jesse] What happens now? I'll tell you what happens now.
#unknown Yo scumbag brotherinlaw is finished, done.
#unknown You understand? I will own him when this is over.
#unknown Every cent he earns, every cent his wife earns, is mine.
#unknown Anyplace he goes, anywhere he turns, I'm going to be there, grabbing my share.
#unknown He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana for pennies, and I'll be standing over him to get my cut.
#unknown He'll see me when he wakes up in the morning and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat hole's left for him after I shred his house down, I will haunt his crusty ass forever until the day he sticks a gun up his mouth and pulls the trigger just to get me out of his head.
#unknown That's what happens next.
#unknown Uh, my advice [chuckles] that's probably not a good strategy.
#unknown I mean, they're scared of you right now.
#unknown They want nothing to do with you.
#unknown But if you hit them, they're forced to hit back hard.
#unknown I mean, they will turn over every rock hither, thither, and yon until someone spills the beans on you and anyone associated with you, uh, present company included.
#unknown Yeah, I think what Saul is saying makes a lot of sense.
#unknown Jesse, move on with your life.
#unknown Leave it behind, all of it.
#unknown Nothing changes.
#unknown Once I walk out of here, I get myself a new RV and go start cooking again.
#unknown How exactly do you think you're going to get away with that? They will catch you.
#unknown So what? What? I have a Get Out of Jail Free card.
#unknown Hey, I may have overstated the, uh, power of your face.
#unknown Not this.
#unknown If the cops catch me I give them what they want the most.
#unknown You.
#unknown They nab me, I make a deal to give up the great Heisenberg and his milliondollar drug ring.
#unknown You're my free pass, bitch.
#unknown [Saul] You're so sure.
#unknown Look, if he didn't give up my name while Hank was beating him senseless, he's never going to talk.
#unknown What do you think that was in there, a bluff? He wants your brotherinlaw.
#unknown And there's going to be a parade of lawyers creaming their Underoos for a case like that.
#unknown I mean, I'd take it myself if it wouldn't cause so much collateral damage.
#unknown And him cooking again.
#unknown Hey, when, not if, he gets caught, and he's facing 20 years, what'll he do then? Believe me, there's no honor among thieves.
#unknown Except for us, of course.
#unknown No, he'll he'll come around.
#unknown And if he doesn't, there may come a time to talk options.
#unknown Options? I'm convinced that Mr.
#unknown Pinkman was involved in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl2 methamphetamine, specifically what we're calling the blue meth.
#unknown I tracked him to a scrap yard where he stored an early '80s camper, an RV.
#unknown While waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle, which I believed to be a rolling meth lab, I received a telephone call telling me my wife Marie had been injured in an accident.
#unknown Upon hearing the news, I left Mr.
#unknown Pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife.
#unknown After arriving at the hospital, I learned the emergency call was a hoax.
#unknown My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.
#unknown [clears throat] So I immediately went back to the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.
#unknown Most likely destroyed on site.
#unknown And it was at this point that you drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman? [whispering] I think we're done here.
#unknown Agent Schrader needs to get home, get some rest.
#unknown That's fine.
#unknown But just to confirm, you're taking the Fifth here? Yeah.
#unknown That's correct.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, we just want to GI you all a heads up.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Pinkman is pressing charges in this matter.
#unknown He's given a detailed version of events as he sees them.
#unknown The word of a meth head.
#unknown We know all about his history.
#unknown We're well aware, but toxicology on Pinkman his blood is clean, he's not using.
#unknown The kid is even refusing his doctorordered pain meds, as far as we can tell.
#unknown So, um where do we go from here? A couple of gentlemen from OPR will come down, probably tomorrow morning.
#unknown Janice will give us an exact time on that.
#unknown And you men will be continuing your investigation, so Thanks for your time.
#unknown Right.
#unknown We just We need one more thing.
#unknown Photo of Agent Schrader's hands, for the record.
#unknown Yes, of course.
#unknown Bandage off, if you would.
#unknown Um, on the table is fine.
#unknown Flat on the table is fine.
#unknown [elevator bell dings] [sobbing] [elevator bell dings] It's all going to work out.
#unknown You've been too good to them for too many years.
#unknown I hope it goes without saying that we're not talking to anybody about this, okay? Okay.
#unknown Marie, who? [knock on door] Hi.
#unknown Do you have a minute? Sure.
#unknown I guess crime does pay.
#unknown I don't suppose you just came by to insult me.
#unknown No.
#unknown We need to talk.
#unknown You heard about Hank? About what happened with this, um, Jesse Pinkman? Yes, I know.
#unknown Whatever Hank was investigating, him trying to find an RV, is there any danger that could lead back to you? No.
#unknown Why would it? Is this why you're here? I'm here to talk about Hank.
#unknown Mmhmm.
#unknown You know what's going to happen to him if this Pinkman presses charges? Hank could lose everything.
#unknown I thought maybe, um There's a way you could help him.
#unknown How? Contact Pinkman.
#unknown Get him to drop the charges.
#unknown Look, Skyler, I don't know what kind of relationship you picture me having with this person.
#unknown I'm not asking.
#unknown He was He's He's not my friend.
#unknown I mean, it's not as if we I'm were even close.
#unknown I'm not asking.
#unknown But there must be something you could say.
#unknown Isn't it even worth a try? Hank is your family.
#unknown Not currently.
#unknown What? I said not currently.
#unknown I'm late.
#unknown I have to go.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown I was starting to get worried.
#unknown Car trouble.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown That's a bummer.
#unknown You should call me next time.
#unknown I'll pick you up.
#unknown Uhhuh.
#unknown No, uh, no sandals today? I just thought a bit more professional.
#unknown Well, everything is on track.
#unknown We got our distillate.
#unknown Just waiting to Let's get our trays ready.
#unknown Clean, no moisture.
#unknown Done.
#unknown Is our, uh Our solvent filtered? I thought you might ask that.
#unknown Done.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown Hand in glove.
#unknown That's what we strive for.
#unknown Yo5 know, this might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
#unknown [chuckling] So, you the gentlemen? Lucky you boys called me.
#unknown I got a load to pick up.
#unknown I'm taking the 40 straight through to Memphis.
#unknown I could hammer it out in about 15, but there's a girl down there named Lainie or Lolly or something.
#unknown Maybe Fran.
#unknown She's got one of these fetish things wants to get peed on.
#unknown I was hoping to see her tonight, so I want to wrap it up here ASAP because traffic can be a wild card, you know, rubbernecking and such.
#unknown The surprising thing is women who like to get peed on always tend to be from the warmer climates.
#unknown You'd think the ones in the colder zones would be more inclined.
#unknown Maybe it's a shock to the system if the body's not properly acclimated, but, you know, I leave that for smart minds than me.
#unknown Science is a mystery.
#unknown Well, take a gander.
#unknown Prices are negotiable.
#unknown Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
#unknown I'm running a special on these little honeys.
#unknown JHPs.
#unknown Hollowpoint bullets, known by the natives as Black Death.
#unknown Check it out.
#unknown Huh.
#unknown You like that? So sweet, you want to lick it.
#unknown Nickelplated brass casing, Lubalox coat for panache.
#unknown Sucker has six razor claws that expand upon impact.
#unknown Whew.
#unknown Shred your mama's head like a cabbage.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Keep it.
#unknown On the house? Anyhow, I've been windjamming long enough.
#unknown Why don't you boys tell me what you're looking for? What can I do you for? Vests.
#unknown Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.
#unknown Right here.
#unknown Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded noninterwoven Kevlar fiber.

#unknown I said 85.
#unknown No.
#unknown I, uh I wrote it down.
#unknown You said 75.
#unknown I I wrote it.
#unknown Well, then you wrote it wrong.
#unknown That's not what I said.
#unknown I said 85.
#unknown It's always been 85 not 75, not 95.
#unknown This is chemistry.
#unknown Degrees matter.
#unknown I'm sorry.

#unknown With a pipe? It happened fast.
#unknown He resisted arrest, and muscle memory kicked in, and you had to disarm him.
#unknown Muscle memory.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown It happens all the time.
#unknown Years of training, and your body acted faster than your brain.
#unknown You had no choice but to hit him.
#unknown You had to fight back.
#unknown Marie, Marie, Marie.
#unknown No.
#unknown I'm not going to go in there and lie.
#unknown It's some lowlife degenerate versus you Doing the job you're supposed to.
#unknown Why should you be the one who pays for doing the right thing? Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.
#unknown It's not what the job is.
#unknown I'm supposed to be better than that.
#unknown And you made one mistake.
#unknown No, it wasn't one mistake.
#unknown I've been [sighs] I've been unraveling, you know? I don't sleep at night anymore.

#unknown And it's just gotten worse.
#unknown What I did to Pinkman that's not who I'm supposed to be.
#unknown That's not me.
#unknown All this everything that's happened, I I swear to God, Marie, I think the universe is trying to tell me something, and I'm finally Ready to listen.
#unknown I'm just not the man I thought I was.

#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown This whole Gale situation he's he's just not working out.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Now.
#unknown It It may sound unorthodox, but I think our first best option Is Jesse Pinkman.

#unknown ThThere's There's a a shorthand that exists between us experience together at a level that, quite frankly, I I'm just never going to reach with Gale.
#unknown Look, Mr.
