walter_white  okay. Get
Walter_White  Hey.
jesse_pinkman  It's a bold plan, Mr. White.
jesse_pinkman  sure this is the way to go?
hospital_medic  Not a whole lot.
hospital_medic  He came in dehydrated and disoriented but once we gave him fluids he stabilised pretty quickly. But
skyler_white  But I mean.
skyler_white  He knows where he is?
hospital_medic  Oh, yes, yes.
hospital_medic  Absolutely.
hospital_medic  It's only the last day or so that seem to be missing.
hospital_medic  Go on in. He's
hospital_medic  He's probably awake.
walter_white  I'm so sorry.
walter_white_jr.  You know who I am, right?
walter_white  Yes, son.
walter_white  I know who you are. Come
walter_white_jr.  Come here.
walter_white_jr.  Give your old man a hug
walter_white  so good to see you
skyler_white  do you
walter_white  I. I feel like myself.
walter_white  Really, I mean, in.
walter_white  past couple days are missing, but other than that I feel fine.
skyler_white  My
skyler_white  Walt. What a day this has been
walter_white_jr.  So, Uncle Hank, he was in a shootout?
walter_white  A shootout?
walter_white_jr.  He killed some guy.
walter_white_jr.  Some big drug dealer.
walter_white_jr.  Uncle Hank wasted him. Oh,
walter_white  my God.
walter_white  Is he all right?
skyler_white  Absolutely fine.
walter_white  Where did this happen? How
walter_white  How could?
skyler_white  Walt, everything's okay. We're all okay. We'll be all right.
skyler_white  And no
marie_schrader  no idea what caused it?
skyler_white  No.
skyler_white  But they're gonna run a whole series of tests, so.
marie_schrader  But what could it be
marie_schrader  mean, did they give you a worstcase scenario?
skyler_white  I really.
skyler_white  You know, there's no point in getting ahead of ourselves, so.
marie_schrader  Well, which supermarket?
marie_schrader  Is it, like, a big one?
marie_schrader  Like, a chain?
skyler_white  Marie.
marie_schrader  I. Don't get me wrong
marie_schrader  I think it's just great that, you know, he's back and he's feeling better.
marie_schrader  I just, I mean.
marie_schrader  He. Naked?
marie_schrader  He was naked.
marie_schrader  Naked.
marie_schrader  In a supermarket.
marie_schrader  It wasn't Whole Foods, was it? In any case, I'm gonna get over there as soon as I can. No, no. Don't worry about it right
marie_schrader  How's
skyler_white  How's Hank?
marie_schrader  You know, I ran over here and I got to see him all of 30 seconds before they yanked him away.
marie_schrader  You know, you'd think today of all days they'd let him go home on time.
skyler_white  how is
skyler_white  is he
marie_schrader  Hank?
marie_schrader  He's indestructible, you know that.
hank_schrader  identified myself and told the suspect to show his hands, turn and face me.
hank_schrader  At this point, I identified the suspect as Mr. Salamanca and observed what appeared to be a gunshot wound in his midsection.
ramey  He was shot previous to your arrival?
hank_schrader  Yes, sir.
hank_schrader  Again I instructed him to show his hands.
hank_schrader  Mr. Salamanca lunged toward the vehicle and fired on me with what I ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.
hank_schrader  I returned fire and sought cover as Mr. Salamanca proceeded to engage me.
hank_schrader  When he paused to reload I was able to take an effective shot.
ramey  Agent Schrader what were you doing in a shooting fight on your own, with no backup?
hank_schrader  Mr. Salamanca's presence was not something I'd anticipated.
hank_schrader  I was tending to another matter.
ramey  What other matter?
hank_schrader  An unrelated family matter.
george_merkert  Searching for your brotherinlaw, as I understand.
ramey  Your brotherinlaw?
hank_schrader  Yes, sir.
hank_schrader  He's since been found.
hank_schrader  He's fine.
hank_schrader  The whole thing was a misunderstanding.
hank_schrader  At the time, he'd been missing for hours and since he's in poor health, the whole family was concerned.
hank_schrader  I was talking to his acquaintances trying to get a fix on his whereabouts.
hank_schrader  The Monte Carlo at the scene belonged to a former student of his a Jesse Pinkman.
hank_schrader  tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car when I came across Mr. Salamanca.
george_merkert  And what about this Pinkman?
george_merkert  What was his car doing at the crime scene?
george_merkert  Have you run him down yet?
hank_schrader  Not yet, but we're working on it.
badger  Man, they're like Jehovah's Witnesses.
badger  They don't give up.
badger  I don't get it.
badger  Why don't they kick your door down?
jesse_pinkman  They need probable cause.
badger  Probable cause?
badger  what did you do? Rob
badger  Rob a bank?
jesse_pinkman  I told you, this is serious shit.
jesse_pinkman  I'm like an outlaw.
jesse_pinkman  Let's do this.
badger  Holy Christ!
badger  You're Willy Wonka.
badger  You are Willy Wonka, and I got the golden ticket.
badger  Put me on your magical boat, man.
badger  Sail me down your chocolaty river of meth.
badger  So where you keep the pseudo
jesse_pinkman  It's a P2P cook.
jesse_pinkman  That barrel?
jesse_pinkman  Aqueous methylamine. With
jesse_pinkman  that, you don't need pseudo.
jesse_pinkman  Come on, help me out, man.
badger  No pseudo?
badger  Come to me, beautiful baby.
badger  I'm gonna be so good to you.
jesse_pinkman  Just
jesse_pinkman  Just take this,
badger  But I can't just let you break this down.
badger  That'd be sacrilege. I
jesse_pinkman  I told you, that's why we're here.
jesse_pinkman  You saw the cops.
badger  Right
jesse_pinkman  Right? Sure.
badger  But couldn't we just cook one quick batch? You
badger  You know, for the road? No
jesse_pinkman  No, forget it, all right? This
jesse_pinkman  This stuff has to go, like, now.
badger  Dude, you owe me.
badger  I mean, we're cool, but I ain't forgetting you just left me stranded.
jesse_pinkman  God, Badger! Don't mess with me.
jesse_pinkman  Got
badger  Yeah, I got it.
jesse_pinkman  my God.
badger  that's all of it. This was a bad choice.
jesse_pinkman  You sure about this guy?
badger  He's totally, totally cool.
badger  He's my cousin.
jesse_pinkman  Yo, what'd we say, 500? We
clovis  We didn't say, and it's 1000.
jesse_pinkman  Thousand bucks?
jesse_pinkman  Come on, where you towing it, man, Seattle?
clovis  the miles, it's the cargo.
jesse_pinkman  Look, I mean, all I got on me is 560.
clovis  You know what?
badger  Hey No Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.
badger  He's totally good for it.
badger  Jesse's a standup dude.
clovis  right?
clovis  You a standup dude?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, I am.
jesse_pinkman  I will get you the other 500.
clovis  Five hundred
clovis  Your word's your bond, right? Right.
badger  saved your skinny ass, yo.
badger  I totally vouched for you. What are you doing
jesse_pinkman  exactly? I'm
badger  giving you, like, two hours and then I'm calling on a pay phone, not a cell phone
jesse_pinkman  phone. You're not using your own name.
badger  I mean, obviously.
badger  Look, dude, I'll do, like, what you said, but why?
badger  Why do you gotta go and do this?
jesse_pinkman  They need probable cause.
jesse_pinkman  I'm giving it to them.
dr._soper  What's the last thing you remember?
walter_white  I was driving home.
walter_white  I think
skyler_white  Do you remember coming home?
skyler_white  You came in, and I asked why you were out of breath?
skyler_white  You don't remember talking to me when I was in the bathtub?
walter_white  I don't. Nothing
dr._soper  Nothing else? No
dr._soper  No fleeting images?
walter_white  no.
walter_white  I was
walter_white  I was walking down some road or highway with a lot of headlights and I remember feeling fear.
walter_white  right.
dr._soper  Thank you.
dr._delcavoli  Well, there's definitely some good news here.
dr._delcavoli  The MRI shows no metastases.
skyler_white  Meaning the cancer hasn't spread to the brain?
dr._delcavoli  Yeah, we're looking really good.
skyler_white  Oh,
skyler_white  So, what was it, then?
dr._soper  There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
dr._delcavoli  And considering your condition the blood panel looks good.
skyler_white  what are we talking about?
skyler_white  What happened?
dr._delcavoli  As of right now, we really can't say.
walter_white  Forgive me.
walter_white  Granted, this is not my field but isn't it possible that this had something to do with all the prescriptions I've been taking?
walter_white  There's the antiemetic the antitussive the this, the that.
walter_white  Not to mention the chemo itself.
walter_white  And being off all of them for the past few days, I have to say l'm feeling much better.
skyler_white  Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up these medications the information sheets are as long as your arm.
skyler_white  I mean, it's page after page of side effects and warnings. Right,
walter_white  exactly.
walter_white  Could it be that simple?
dr._delcavoli  Well, we'll take another look at that, sure.
dr._delcavoli  Walt, I understand that you've been kind of stressed out lately.
walter_white  Stressed out
walter_white  out?
walter_white  l No, I don't think I'm
skyler_white  Walt, please. Stressed
skyler_white  Stressed out is putting it mildly.
walter_white  Well, I guess I've had a lot on my mind lately, but as I've said l'm feeling much better.
walter_white  Shouldn't we be talking about when I can get out of here?
dr._delcavoli  Well, that may still be a ways down the road.
walter_white  A ways down the road?
dr._soper  Actually, I think our next move is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.
walter_white  Now, is that absolutely necessary?
dr._delcavoli  Nobody likes being in the hospital.
dr._delcavoli  I get that.
dr._delcavoli  But until we know what caused this incident we can't be certain it won't
jesse_pinkman  recur. That your last hit?
jesse_pinkman  Finish it quick.
jesse_pinkman  hands. Get on your stomach now. Get on your stomach now! Get over. Roll! Do it now! I'm going,
jesse_pinkman  What's going on?
jesse_pinkman  What did I do?
hank_schrader  Jesse Pinkman, I presume.
jesse_pinkman  What, man?
hank_schrader  Tell me again.
jesse_pinkman  Again?
jesse_pinkman  What's there to tell, okay?
jesse_pinkman  Her and I were partying, that's it.
hank_schrader  Since Saturday night?
hank_schrader  for three days straight.
hank_schrader  Just bumping uglies and smoking that crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?
jesse_pinkman  Taco?
jesse_pinkman  I don't know any Taco and I damn sure didn't say anything about no crystal.
steven_gomez  Three days, you must have got hungry.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, I guess.
steven_gomez  You order takeout? Yeah. Yeah, where from
hank_schrader  You
hank_schrader  You get yourself a little of that moo goo gai pan from that chink place around the corner?
jesse_pinkman  No, no, we didn't. We
jesse_pinkman  We got stuff from the vending machine.
jesse_pinkman  You know, Funyuns.
jesse_pinkman  had a Hot Pocket.
hank_schrader  Funyuns and
hank_schrader  Hot Pockets? You didn't notice your car was gone?
jesse_pinkman  No, not until you guys went and busted down the door.
jesse_pinkman  Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?
jesse_pinkman  Management's gonna be on my ass for sure.
hank_schrader  You weren't answering your phone.
jesse_pinkman  It was in my car.
hank_schrader  We found your car but your phone wasn't in it.
jesse_pinkman  You found my car? You found my car?
jesse_pinkman  DEA all the way.
jesse_pinkman  Yes.
hank_schrader  Since we're talking about missing property, did you? Did you
hank_schrader  leave anything else in the car? Like
jesse_pinkman  I don't know
hank_schrader  Like
hank_schrader  this? Sixtyseven
hank_schrader  thousand, nine hundred and 20 dollars
hank_schrader  That's not mine. That's not yours?
hank_schrader  He says it's not his, Gomie.
hank_schrader  Gee, I really thought this might be yours.
jesse_pinkman  I wish.
steven_gomez  Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice
steven_gomez  Nice.
hank_schrader  You know what we got here, Gomie, don't you?
hank_schrader  That's a new interdiction van right there, yeah.
hank_schrader  Definitely new softball jerseys, because we need them.
steven_gomez  Good thing Tuco's already dead.
steven_gomez  I lost this kind of money, I'd wanna kill myself.
hank_schrader  So who's your chief, little Injun?
jesse_pinkman  What?
jesse_pinkman  What does that even mean?
hank_schrader  I think your story's bullshit.
hank_schrader  I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was.
hank_schrader  Your car was there because you were there.
hank_schrader  Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there and you know about that too.
jesse_pinkman  what are you saying?
jesse_pinkman  shot someone?
jesse_pinkman  like, a gun?
hank_schrader  You?
hank_schrader  No.
hank_schrader  Only shooting you do is into a Kleenex.
hank_schrader  think you know the badass who did.
jesse_pinkman  I was partying with Wendy, okay?
hank_schrader  Funyuns and boomboom.
hank_schrader  No.
hank_schrader  I don't think so.
hank_schrader  Tell you what.
hank_schrader  We're gonna go talk to that skinny yeast factory of a girlfriend you got.
hank_schrader  And you know what?
hank_schrader  got a feeling she's gonna, you know, roll on you.
hank_schrader  Don't go nowhere.
wendy  Where's my root beer? Come
wendy  Come on.
wendy  I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.
wendy  I got medical issues.
hank_schrader  Medical issues?
hank_schrader  Like, what kind of medical issues?
hank_schrader  got penis withdrawal?
hank_schrader  You got schlongus interruptus?
hank_schrader  Wendy, listen. Talk
hank_schrader  Talk to me and you get a root beer and a tinkle.
hank_schrader  Tell me the last three days.
wendy  I told you we were shacked up since Saturday.
hank_schrader  Neither of you left the room?
hank_schrader  Not even for a little, little minute?
hank_schrader  Not even for a second?
wendy  For a second?
wendy  I don't know, maybe.
hank_schrader  Maybe?
hank_schrader  Jesse leave the room?
hank_schrader  He did, didn't he
hank_schrader  Wendy, you can do it.
hank_schrader  You can do it,
hank_schrader  Wendy. Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.
hank_schrader  You know you wanna go back to giving windys, Wendy.
wendy  It's you.
wendy  I know you.
wendy  You're the one in the black truck.
wendy  You wanted me to do that kid.
steven_gomez  What
wendy  The kid with the crutches.
wendy  The football player. How
hank_schrader  How about we stay on topic?
wendy  Look, Jesse came over to the palace at 11:00 Saturday night.
wendy  We were together the whole time, and he never left the room.
wendy  And that's all I'm saying about that.
wendy  Now, come on.
wendy  Where's my root beer?
steven_gomez  You wanted her to bang a football player, pervert? It's a long
hank_schrader  long story, Gomie.
steven_gomez  I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it, but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.
hank_schrader  Not yet.
hank_schrader  got one more shot at that little skid mark.
dr._chavez  how are you sleeping?
walter_white  Most nights.
walter_white  Good.
dr._chavez  Have you noticed any recurring thoughts or images things you can't get out of your head?
dr._chavez  about feelings of guilt or persecution?
walter_white  No.
walter_white  Look, doctor, I don't mean to be rude but where is this going, exactly?
dr._chavez  We're starting a process, Walt.
dr._chavez  An ongoing process.
dr._chavez  Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
walter_white  Ongoing for how long?
dr._chavez  I just met you.
dr._chavez  Hard to say.
dr._chavez  We could be talking about days, weeks, months.
walter_white  doctor, I feel fine, really.
walter_white  Now if this is truly necessary, can't I continue as an
dr._chavez  Walt a fugue state is a very serious event.
dr._chavez  What if you were to disassociate while driving?
dr._chavez  Get into a situation where you could be shot by the police?
dr._chavez  We can't allow you to leave until we're certain what happened was a nonrecurring event.
dr._chavez  Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this.
walter_white  Would you tell me about patient confidentiality?
dr._chavez  It's very straightforward.
dr._chavez  Without your permission, I can't disclose anything to anyone.
walter_white  What about my family?
dr._chavez  Not your family, not to the police. Not
dr._chavez  Not to anyone.
dr._chavez  The exception would be if you threatened to kill someone.
dr._chavez  Then I'd be able to tell that person, but only that person.
walter_white  And you, as a medical practitioner you abide by these strictures absolutely.
dr._chavez  Yes.
walter_white  There was no fugue state.
walter_white  I remember everything.
walter_white  The truth is I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house.
walter_white  I just had to get out and so I left.
walter_white  I didn't think about it.
walter_white  I just did it.
walter_white  I walked for a long time, and when I couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.
walter_white  I got as far as Gallup and then it was just time to come home.
dr._chavez  So being found naked in a supermarket that was your way of giving credibility to a lie?
dr._chavez  Of avoiding questions about your disappearance?
dr._chavez  Why run away?
dr._chavez  What did you feel you had to run from?
walter_white  Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant with a baby we didn't intend.
walter_white  My 15yearold son has cerebral palsy.
walter_white  I am an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher.
walter_white  When I can work, I make $43,700 per year.
walter_white  I have watched all of my colleagues and friends surpass me in every way imaginable and within 18 months, I will be dead.
walter_white  And you ask why I ran?
hank_schrader  Gomie, you wanna do the honours?
tio's_nurse  That means yes.
tio's_nurse  Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
jesse_pinkman  Come on, this is bullshit.
jesse_pinkman  I mean, look at this dude. He
jesse_pinkman  He doesn't even know what planet he's living on.
steven_gomez  Senor are we on the planet Mars?
steven_gomez  we on the planet Saturn?
steven_gomez  Are we on the planet Earth?
Steven_Gomez  Senor, is today Friday?
steven_gomez  Is today Monday?
steven_gomez  Is today Tuesday?
hank_schrader  Okay, seems like he's all there.
hank_schrader  Let's go for it.
steven_gomez  Senor was this man at your house yesterday?
steven_gomez  Senor, was this man at your house yesterday?
hank_schrader  This guy right here, he was at your house, right?
hank_schrader  Was he doing business with your nephew Tuco?
Steven_Gomez  Senor, are you scared of this man?
hank_schrader  No, he's not scared.
hank_schrader  Come on, Granddad.
steven_gomez  man.
hank_schrader  I guess that's a no.
steven_gomez  I told you, numbnuts. This
steven_gomez  This guy's OG.
hank_schrader  Oh, yeah, yeah.
steven_gomez  Kept his mouth shut for 17 years in San Quentin.
steven_gomez  Stroke or no stroke, oldschool gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.
hank_schrader  All right. It
hank_schrader  It was worth a try at least.
steven_gomez  gotta kick Pinkman loose.
steven_gomez  It's all right. He's
steven_gomez  He's nobody anyway.
hank_schrader  You telling me you buy that lameass story?
steven_gomez  I buy that lameass story more than I buy he had anything to do with shooting Tuco,
jesse_pinkman  Hey, Dad.
jesse_pinkman  can you hear me?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, I'm.

jesse_pinkman  I've been busy as.
jesse_pinkman  As totally productive.
jesse_pinkman  you know what?
jesse_pinkman  I'm actually zeroing in on a job.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, yeah, data entry, like we talked about.

jesse_pinkman  Okay.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah. No
jesse_pinkman  No.
jesse_pinkman  l
jesse_pinkman  I get it.
jesse_pinkman  I get it.
jesse_pinkman  Thanks.
jesse_pinkman  Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere, nobody followed.
jesse_pinkman  So how did it go?
walter_white  Okay.
walter_white  You?
jesse_pinkman  sweated me plenty, but they finally cut me loose.
jesse_pinkman  you getting out of there?
walter_white  Tomorrow.
walter_white  So who came for you?
walter_white  The DEA?
walter_white  What did they ask you?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
jesse_pinkman  Your scumbag brotherinlaw took my rainyday fund.
walter_white  Your what?
walter_white  is that? My
jesse_pinkman  My rainyday fund.
jesse_pinkman  Sixtyeight thousand, okay?
jesse_pinkman  Cueball son of a bitch laughed in my face.
jesse_pinkman  Now I got like 80 bucks to my name.
walter_white  Wait, wait. What
walter_white  What does he know?
walter_white  Does he know it's your money?
jesse_pinkman  No, man.
jesse_pinkman  He doesn't know shit, okay?
jesse_pinkman  The plan worked.
jesse_pinkman  bought it.
jesse_pinkman  I got bills due, man.
jesse_pinkman  I'm screwed.
walter_white  Did he mention my name?
jesse_pinkman  No.
jesse_pinkman  Thanks for caring.
walter_white  about the basement?
jesse_pinkman  clean.
walter_white  And the
jesse_pinkman  Badger's cousin took it to his garage. It's
jesse_pinkman  It's safe.

skyler_white  hand.
walter_white_jr.  Sorry, honey.
steven_gomez  Southwest Aniline again?
steven_gomez  What's this?
hank_schrader  the blue meth we found up by your late homey.
steven_gomez  Tuco wasn't my homey, any more than Charlie Manson was yours.
hank_schrader  Lab says it got cooked, P2Pstyle.
steven_gomez  P2P, huh?
steven_gomez  what are you thinking?
steven_gomez  The two stooges over here cooked it?
hank_schrader  Lab said that blue meth's the purest they've seen.
hank_schrader  least since this.
hank_schrader  Yeah. Krazy8, Tuco.
hank_schrader  Somehow, some way, it's all connected.
hank_schrader  A simple explanation only I'm not seeing it, and it's making my head hurt.
steven_gomez  That's because you're working that ugly melon too hard.
steven_gomez  It's dead around here.
steven_gomez  Let's get a couple of beers.
hank_schrader  It's 11 in the morning.
