#unknown Okay.
#unknown That's okay.
#unknown Get that.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Oh, jeez.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Please.
#unknown It's a bold plan, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown You sure this is the way to go? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You see that? What does he remember? Not a whole lot.
#unknown He came in dehydrated and disoriented but once we gave him fluids he stabilised pretty quickly.
#unknown But I mean.
#unknown He knows where he is? Oh, yes, yes.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown It's only the last day or so that seem to be missing.
#unknown Go on in.
#unknown He's probably awake.
#unknown My God.
#unknown Walter.
#unknown I'm so sorry.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown You know who I am, right? Yes, son.
#unknown I know who you are.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Give your old man a hug.
#unknown It's so good to see you.
#unknown How do you feel? Better.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I.
#unknown I feel like myself.
#unknown Really, I mean, in.
#unknown The past couple days are missing, but other than that I feel fine.
#unknown My God, Walt.
#unknown What a day this has been.
#unknown So, Uncle Hank, he was in a shootout? A shootout? He killed some guy.
#unknown Some big drug dealer.
#unknown Uncle Hank wasted him.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Is he all right? Absolutely fine.
#unknown Where did this happen? How could? Walt, everything's okay.
#unknown We're all okay.
#unknown We'll be all right.
#unknown And no idea what caused it? No.
#unknown But they're gonna run a whole series of tests, so.
#unknown But what could it be? I mean, did they give you a worstcase scenario? I really.
#unknown You know, there's no point in getting ahead of ourselves, so.
#unknown Well, which supermarket? Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain? Marie.
#unknown I.
#unknown Don't get me wrong.
#unknown I think it's just great that, you know, he's back and he's feeling better.
#unknown I just, I mean.
#unknown He.
#unknown Naked? He was naked.
#unknown Naked.
#unknown In a supermarket.
#unknown It wasn't Whole Foods, was it? In any case, I'm gonna get over there as soon as I can.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown Don't worry about it right now, Marie.
#unknown How's Hank? You know, I ran over here and I got to see him all of 30 seconds before they yanked him away.
#unknown You know, you'd think today of all days they'd let him go home on time.
#unknown But how is he? Really? Hank? He's indestructible, you know that.
#unknown I identified myself and told the suspect to show his hands, turn and face me.
#unknown At this point, I identified the suspect as Mr.
#unknown Salamanca and observed what appeared to be a gunshot wound in his midsection.
#unknown He was shot previous to your arrival? Yes, sir.
#unknown Again I instructed him to show his hands.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Salamanca lunged toward the vehicle and fired on me with what I ascertained to be an M16 assault rifle.
#unknown I returned fire and sought cover as Mr.
#unknown Salamanca proceeded to engage me.
#unknown When he paused to reload I was able to take an effective shot.
#unknown Agent Schrader what were you doing in a shooting fight on your own, with no backup? Mr.
#unknown Salamanca's presence was not something I'd anticipated.
#unknown I was tending to another matter.
#unknown What other matter? An unrelated family matter.
#unknown Searching for your brotherinlaw, as I understand.
#unknown Your brotherinlaw? Yes, sir.
#unknown He's since been found.
#unknown He's fine.
#unknown The whole thing was a misunderstanding.
#unknown At the time, he'd been missing for hours and since he's in poor health, the whole family was concerned.
#unknown I was talking to his acquaintances trying to get a fix on his whereabouts.
#unknown The Monte Carlo at the scene belonged to a former student of his a Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown I was tracking down Mr.
#unknown Pinkman's car when I came across Mr.
#unknown Salamanca.
#unknown And what about this Pinkman? What was his car doing at the crime scene? Have you run him down yet? Not yet, but we're working on it.
#unknown Man, they're like Jehovah's Witnesses.
#unknown They don't give up.
#unknown I don't get it.
#unknown Why don't they kick your door down? They need probable cause.
#unknown Probable cause? Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank? I told you, this is serious shit.
#unknown I'm like an outlaw.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Let's do this.
#unknown Holy Christ! You're Willy Wonka.
#unknown You are Willy Wonka, and I got the golden ticket.
#unknown Put me on your magical boat, man.
#unknown Sail me down your chocolaty river of meth.
#unknown So where you keep the pseudo? It's a P2P cook.
#unknown That barrel? Aqueous methylamine.
#unknown With that, you don't need pseudo.
#unknown Come on, help me out, man.
#unknown No pseudo? Come to me, beautiful baby.
#unknown I'm gonna be so good to you.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Just take this, here.
#unknown But I can't just let you break this down.
#unknown That'd be sacrilege.
#unknown I told you, that's why we're here.
#unknown You saw the cops.
#unknown Right? Sure.
#unknown But couldn't we just cook one quick batch? You know, for the road? No, forget it, all right? This stuff has to go, like, now.
#unknown Dude, you owe me.
#unknown I mean, we're cool, but I ain't forgetting you just left me stranded.
#unknown God, Badger! Don't mess with me.
#unknown Got it? Yeah, I got it.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Okay, that's all of it.
#unknown This was a bad choice.
#unknown You sure about this guy? He's totally, totally cool.
#unknown He's my cousin.
#unknown Yo, what'd we say, 500? We didn't say, and it's 1000.
#unknown Thousand bucks? Come on, where you towing it, man, Seattle? It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.
#unknown Look, I mean, all I got on me is 560.
#unknown You know what? Hey No Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.
#unknown He's totally good for it.
#unknown Jesse's a standup dude.
#unknown That right? You a standup dude? Yeah, I am.
#unknown I will get you the other 500.
#unknown Five hundred more.
#unknown Your word's your bond, right? Right.
#unknown I saved your skinny ass, yo.
#unknown I totally vouched for you.
#unknown What are you doing now, exactly? I'm giving you, like, two hours and then I'm calling on a pay phone, not a cell phone.
#unknown You're not using your own name.
#unknown I mean, obviously.
#unknown Look, dude, I'll do, like, what you said, but why? Why do you gotta go and do this? They need probable cause.
#unknown I'm giving it to them.
#unknown What's the last thing you remember? Well, I was driving home.
#unknown I think.
#unknown And.
#unknown Do you remember coming home? You came in, and I asked why you were out of breath? You don't remember talking to me when I was in the bathtub? No, I'm sorry, I don't.
#unknown Nothing else? No fleeting images? Well, no.
#unknown I.
#unknown I was I was walking down some road or highway with a lot of headlights and I remember feeling fear.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Well, there's definitely some good news here.
#unknown The MRI shows no metastases.
#unknown Meaning the cancer hasn't spread to the brain? Yeah, we're looking really good.
#unknown Oh, thank God.
#unknown So, what was it, then? There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
#unknown And considering your condition the blood panel looks good.
#unknown Then what are we talking about? What happened? As of right now, we really can't say.
#unknown Forgive me.
#unknown Granted, this is not my field but isn't it possible that this had something to do with all the prescriptions I've been taking? There's the antiemetic the antitussive the this, the that.
#unknown Not to mention the chemo itself.
#unknown And being off all of them for the past few days, I have to say l'm feeling much better.
#unknown Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up these medications the information sheets are as long as your arm.
#unknown I mean, it's page after page of side effects and warnings.
#unknown Right, exactly.
#unknown Could it be that simple? Well, we'll take another look at that, sure.
#unknown Walt, I understand that you've been kind of stressed out lately.
#unknown Stressed out? l No, I don't think I'm Walt, please.
#unknown Stressed out is putting it mildly.
#unknown Well, I guess I've had a lot on my mind lately, but as I've said l'm feeling much better.
#unknown Shouldn't we be talking about when I can get out of here? Well, that may still be a ways down the road.
#unknown A ways down the road? Actually, I think our next move is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.
#unknown Now, is that absolutely necessary? Nobody likes being in the hospital.
#unknown I get that.
#unknown But until we know what caused this incident we can't be certain it won't recur.
#unknown That your last hit? Yeah.
#unknown Finish it quick.
#unknown Show your hands.
#unknown Get on your stomach now.
#unknown Get on your stomach now! Get over.
#unknown Roll! Do it now! I'm going, I'm going.
#unknown What's going on? What did I do? Jesse Pinkman, I presume.
#unknown What, man? Tell me again.
#unknown Again? What's there to tell, okay? Her and I were partying, that's it.
#unknown Since Saturday night? Partying for three days straight.
#unknown Just bumping uglies and smoking that crystal you got from your pal, Tuco? Taco? I don't know any Taco and I damn sure didn't say anything about no crystal.
#unknown Three days, you must have got hungry.
#unknown Yeah, I guess.
#unknown You order takeout? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, where from? You get yourself a little of that moo goo gai pan from that chink place around the corner? No, no, we didn't.
#unknown We got stuff from the vending machine.
#unknown You know, Funyuns.
#unknown I had a Hot Pocket.
#unknown Funyuns and Hot Pockets? You didn't notice your car was gone? No, not until you guys went and busted down the door.
#unknown Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh? Management's gonna be on my ass for sure.
#unknown You weren't answering your phone.
#unknown It was in my car.
#unknown That right? Yeah.
#unknown We found your car but your phone wasn't in it.
#unknown You found my car? You found my car? Awesome.
#unknown DEA all the way.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Since we're talking about missing property, did you? Did you leave anything else in the car? Like what? Like what? Like.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Like this? Sixtyseven thousand, nine hundred and 20 dollars.
#unknown That's not mine.
#unknown That's not yours? He says it's not his, Gomie.
#unknown Gee, I really thought this might be yours.
#unknown I wish.
#unknown Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.
#unknown You know what we got here, Gomie, don't you? That's a new interdiction van right there, yeah.
#unknown Definitely new softball jerseys, because we need them.
#unknown Good thing Tuco's already dead.
#unknown I lost this kind of money, I'd wanna kill myself.
#unknown So who's your chief, little Injun? What? What does that even mean? I think your story's bullshit.
#unknown I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was.
#unknown Your car was there because you were there.
#unknown Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there and you know about that too.
#unknown So, what are you saying? I shot someone? With, like, a gun? You? No.
#unknown Only shooting you do is into a Kleenex.
#unknown But I think you know the badass who did.
#unknown Look, I was partying with Wendy, okay? Funyuns and boomboom.
#unknown No.
#unknown I don't think so.
#unknown Tell you what.
#unknown We're gonna go talk to that skinny yeast factory of a girlfriend you got.
#unknown And you know what? I got a feeling she's gonna, you know, roll on you.
#unknown Don't go nowhere.
#unknown Where's my root beer? Come on.
#unknown I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.
#unknown I got medical issues.
#unknown Medical issues? Like, what kind of medical issues? You got penis withdrawal? You got schlongus interruptus? Wendy, listen.
#unknown Talk to me and you get a root beer and a tinkle.
#unknown Tell me the last three days.
#unknown I told you we were shacked up since Saturday.
#unknown Neither of you left the room? Not even for a little, little minute? Not even for a second? For a second? I don't know, maybe.
#unknown Maybe? Did Jesse leave the room? He did, didn't he? Wendy, you can do it.
#unknown You can do it, Wendy.
#unknown Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.
#unknown You know you wanna go back to giving windys, Wendy.
#unknown It's you.
#unknown I know you.
#unknown You're the one in the black truck.
#unknown You wanted me to do that kid.
#unknown What? The kid with the crutches.
#unknown The football player.
#unknown How about we stay on topic? Look, Jesse came over to the palace at 11:00 Saturday night.
#unknown We were together the whole time, and he never left the room.
#unknown And that's all I'm saying about that.
#unknown Now, come on.
#unknown Where's my root beer? You wanted her to bang a football player, pervert? It's a long story, Gomie.
#unknown I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it, but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.
#unknown Not yet.
#unknown I got one more shot at that little skid mark.
#unknown And how are you sleeping? Fine.
#unknown Most nights.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Have you noticed any recurring thoughts or images things you can't get out of your head? How about feelings of guilt or persecution? No.
#unknown Look, doctor, I don't mean to be rude but where is this going, exactly? We're starting a process, Walt.
#unknown An ongoing process.
#unknown Do you prefer Walt or Walter? Ongoing for how long? I just met you.
#unknown Hard to say.
#unknown We could be talking about days, weeks, months.
#unknown Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.
#unknown Now if this is truly necessary, can't I continue as an outpatient? Walt a fugue state is a very serious event.
#unknown What if you were to disassociate while driving? Get into a situation where you could be shot by the police? We can't allow you to leave until we're certain what happened was a nonrecurring event.
#unknown Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this.
#unknown Would you tell me about patient confidentiality? It's very straightforward.
#unknown Without your permission, I can't disclose anything to anyone.
#unknown What about my family? Not your family, not to the police.
#unknown Not to anyone.
#unknown The exception would be if you threatened to kill someone.
#unknown Then I'd be able to tell that person, but only that person.
#unknown And you, as a medical practitioner you abide by these strictures absolutely.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown All right.
#unknown There was no fugue state.
#unknown I remember everything.
#unknown The truth is I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house.
#unknown I just had to get out and so I left.
#unknown I didn't think about it.
#unknown I just did it.
#unknown I walked for a long time, and when I couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.
#unknown I got as far as Gallup and then it was just time to come home.
#unknown So being found naked in a supermarket that was your way of giving credibility to a lie? Of avoiding questions about your disappearance? Why run away? What did you feel you had to run from? Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant with a baby we didn't intend.
#unknown My 15yearold son has cerebral palsy.
#unknown I am an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher.
#unknown When I can work, I make $43,700 per year.
#unknown I have watched all of my colleagues and friends surpass me in every way imaginable and within 18 months, I will be dead.
#unknown And you ask why I ran? Gomie, you wanna do the honours? What's that mean? That means yes.
#unknown Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
#unknown Come on, this is bullshit.
#unknown I mean, look at this dude.
#unknown He doesn't even know what planet he's living on.
#unknown Senor are we on the planet Mars? Are we on the planet Saturn? Are we on the planet Earth? Senor, is today Friday? Is today Monday? Is today Tuesday? Okay, seems like he's all there.
#unknown Let's go for it.
#unknown Senor was this man at your house yesterday? Senor, was this man at your house yesterday? This guy right here, he was at your house, right? Was he doing business with your nephew Tuco? Senor, are you scared of this man? No, he's not scared.
#unknown Come on, Granddad.
#unknown Don't you wanna help us out? Oh, man.
#unknown I guess that's a no.
#unknown I told you, numbnuts.
#unknown This guy's OG.
#unknown Oh, yeah, yeah.
#unknown Kept his mouth shut for 17 years in San Quentin.
#unknown Stroke or no stroke, oldschool gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.
#unknown All right.
#unknown It was worth a try at least.
#unknown We gotta kick Pinkman loose.
#unknown It's all right.
#unknown He's nobody anyway.
#unknown You telling me you buy that lameass story? I buy that lameass story more than I buy he had anything to do with shooting Tuco, man.
#unknown Dad? Hey, Dad.
#unknown Hey, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine.
#unknown Hey, I'm.
#unknown What's? She did? No, I didn't get any messages.
#unknown You know, I actually lost my phone, and I've been too busy to get a new one.
#unknown I've been busy as.
#unknown As totally productive.
#unknown Hey, you know what? I'm actually zeroing in on a job.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, data entry, like we talked about.
#unknown Yeah, I'm totally amped.
#unknown Hey, could you give me a ride? I'm actually I'm downtown and my car's in the.
#unknown Oh, no.
#unknown Yeah, hey, that's cool.
#unknown I will I'll call you later when you have some.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown No.
#unknown l I get it.
#unknown I get it.
#unknown Okay, bye.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown So, what are you doing now? Waffle House? Waffle House is good.
#unknown Pay phone? Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere, nobody followed.
#unknown So how did it go? Okay.
#unknown You? They sweated me plenty, but they finally cut me loose.
#unknown So you getting out of there? Tomorrow.
#unknown So who came for you? The DEA? What did they ask you? Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
#unknown Your scumbag brotherinlaw took my rainyday fund.
#unknown Your what? What is that? My rainyday fund.
#unknown Sixtyeight thousand, okay? Cueball son of a bitch laughed in my face.
#unknown Now I got like 80 bucks to my name.
#unknown Wait, wait.
#unknown What does he know? Does he know it's your money? No, man.
#unknown He doesn't know shit, okay? The plan worked.
#unknown They bought it.
#unknown I got bills due, man.
#unknown I'm screwed.
#unknown Did he mention my name? No.
#unknown Thanks for caring.
#unknown What about the basement? It's clean.
#unknown And the RV? Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
#unknown It's safe.
#unknown Can he get it running again? Why? So we can cook.
#unknown So you still wanna cook? Seriously? What's changed, Jesse? Sevenhundred thirtyseven thousand.
#unknown Twentyone pounds minus cash on hand.
#unknown Cash on hand.
#unknown Sorry, honey.
#unknown Did I wake you? No, I was awake.
#unknown Want some cornflakes? Yeah, sure.
#unknown You okay? Yeah.
#unknown Southwest Aniline again? What's this? It's the blue meth we found up by your late homey.
#unknown Tuco wasn't my homey, any more than Charlie Manson was yours.
#unknown Lab says it got cooked, P2Pstyle.
#unknown P2P, huh? So, what are you thinking? The two stooges over here cooked it? Lab said that blue meth's the purest they've seen.
#unknown At least since this.
#unknown Krazy8.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Krazy8, Tuco.
#unknown Somehow, some way, it's all connected.
#unknown A simple explanation only I'm not seeing it, and it's making my head hurt.
#unknown That's because you're working that ugly melon too hard.
#unknown It's dead around here.
#unknown Let's get a couple of beers.
#unknown It's 11 in the morning.
#unknown I'm buying.
#unknown You're buying? Holy crap.
#unknown What, is it Cinco de Mayo already? Oh, yeah.
#unknown Surprise.
#unknown You little sneaky bastard, you.
#unknown Very nice work.
#unknown Thank you, sir.
#unknown What's this? Look what we got you.
#unknown Look at that, I love it.
#unknown They got the gut right.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown Hey, thanks, man.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown We all got you a little something, and this is from all of us.
#unknown You shouldn't have.
#unknown Oh, you sick, sick puppies.
#unknown I love it.
#unknown You going to finish your apple juice? No, thanks, buddy.
#unknown You take it.
#unknown You're supposed to drink it.
#unknown The nurse said you have to stay hydrated.
#unknown But I'm not thirsty.
#unknown Dad.
#unknown Drink it.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Better late than never, huh? Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown How you doing, buddy? You all right? I see the mark of the beast there, huh? Oh, yeah.
#unknown Marie stopped by this morning.
#unknown They really cheer the place up.
#unknown Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.
#unknown They're rounding up a wheelchair for you, you freeloading bastard.
#unknown So tell us about the shootout.
#unknown I was, you know, just doing my job.
#unknown Whole thing was over in about five seconds.
#unknown Say, Walt, you know how are you? I'm okay.
#unknown Really, I'm feeling fine.
#unknown Yeah? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown The doctor is calling it a.
#unknown An isolated episode of transient global amnesia.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown Which means nonrecurring.
#unknown Nonrecurring.
#unknown That sounds good, yeah.
#unknown Sounds real good.
#unknown I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
#unknown You really gave us a scare.
#unknown Listen, Hank.
#unknown I don't know what to say.
#unknown I mean you going out there looking for me put you in danger, and I'm so.
#unknown Sorry, sorry doesn't even cut it.
#unknown Not nearly.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Is that what you're worried about? Forget it.
#unknown Look, the office, they're treating me like I'm Eliot Ness, okay? They threw me a party, the gals baked me a chocolatechip cake like you wouldn't believe, okay? You ought to disappear more often.
#unknown Just kidding.
#unknown Don't do that.
#unknown Hey, look.
#unknown Look what they gave me.
#unknown Look what they gave me.
#unknown What is it? That, gentlemen, is the grill of the guy I shot.
#unknown His grill? Yeah.
#unknown It kind of goes over the front teeth like that, you know? Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.
#unknown You know, certain folks are attracted to shiny things.
#unknown Wow, cool.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I can't tell you how good it feels to be home.
#unknown I'll get these in the wash.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Say, honey, I.
#unknown I was just thinking about going out to 7Eleven.
#unknown Do you need anything? Big Gulp? Slim Jim? Skyler, listen to me.
#unknown This will not happen again, okay? I won't let it.
#unknown I'm still here.
#unknown I'm me and we're gonna be okay.
#unknown Walt do you have a second cell phone? A second cell phone? The night you disappeared, you came in when I was taking a bath and you were very upset.
#unknown It was like something terrible had happened.
#unknown And then your cell phone rang.
#unknown I saw you check the number, and then you got up and just disappeared.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown And when Hank checked your phone records there was no call.
#unknown No call on the phone I know about.
#unknown That is odd.
#unknown I mean, I don't remember any of that but one thing I am sure of is that I don't have a second cell phone.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown
