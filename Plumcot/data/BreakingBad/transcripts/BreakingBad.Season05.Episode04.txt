benny  Gotta say, when you first brought her in, I had my doubts. But
benny  your little darling's got nine lives.
benny  Rearwheel assembly took the brunt of the impact.
benny  Yeah.
benny  CV shaft, boots, joints, axle Replaced
benny  Replaced all of it.
benny  No way around it
benny  went aftermarket on most of the parts here.
benny  want me to swap in factory parts, that's fine.
benny  But using aftermarket's the only way we'll keep it under Blue Book and on the insurance company's dime, okay?
benny  Nothing beats free.
benny  Swapped out your air filter, topped off your fluids.
benny  Didn't have to replace the windshield this time.
walter_white_jr.  I know, right?
benny  Oh, and I noticed you had some sort of gunky buildup in the front end here.
benny  First, I had no idea what I was looking at.
benny  Then I remembered you had me replace that front fender a few months back when you ran over that deer.
benny  We went at it with the steam hose, cleaned it up for you.
benny  Hardest part was the paint.
benny  Fern green.
benny  Interesting tint.
walter_white  Anything else?
benny  That's it.
benny  Zero balance, like I said.
benny  Sign here, you're good to go.
benny  People like to joke but I really, really like this
benny  this car. She's sturdy as all hell
benny  I'm betting you get another 200,000 miles out of
walter_white  Hey, Benny.
walter_white  What would you give me for it
benny  What's the Blue Book, you mean?
walter_white  No.
walter_white  I mean, what will you pay me for this car?
benny  Well, I'm not really looking for A
walter_white  A hundred dollars?
walter_white  Fifty?
benny  Insurance company just shelled out Then it's a bargain.
walter_white  You
walter_white  You give me 50 bucks, and she's all
benny  yours.
walter_white_jr.  You sure
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Lydia
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Yeah

lydia_rodarte-quayle  No. Not okay, Mike.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Not okay.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  The
lydia_rodarte-quayle  The look he just gave me was the very antithesis of" okay," okay?
mike_ehrmantraut  Breathe, Lydia.
mike_ehrmantraut  No one's talking to the police.
Lydia_Rodarte-Quayle  I just had like 14 DEA agents barge into my office, screaming and yelling at me and they were swarming all over the warehouse, okay?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  The warehouse.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Besides, Ron was my guy.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Remember?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I don't have a guy anymore. Ron
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Ron fixed security, pulled the barrels, drove the truck.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  You can't expect me to do that stuff.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  I mean, let's be realistic.
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Mike, this is
mike_ehrmantraut  I'll send a new guy.
walter_white_jr.  You're crazy.
walter_white_jr.  My car almost has 500 horsepower. It
walter_white_jr.  It would totally smoke Horsepower
walter_white  Horsepower isn't everything.
walter_white  Don't you know that?
walter_white  You have to factor in drag and torque and suspension and weight of the car.
walter_white  One more factor that you're not thinking about :
walter_white  The experience of the driver.
walter_white_jr.  I totally got
walter_white_jr.  got you there
walter_white  there.
walter_white  Please. Please. You

walter_white  Watch your language.
walter_white  And, yes, I did. Seriously
walter_white_jr.  Seriously?

walter_white_jr.  I
walter_white  I take that back
walter_white_jr.  back. Yes. Yes
walter_white_jr.  Yes. No. You're saying yes.
walter_white  Just a joke.
walter_white_jr.  I'm just No
walter_white  No!
walter_white  No, no. That
walter_white  That was kidding. We
walter_white  We didn't shake on
walter_white_jr.  on it
walter_white  Yes
walter_white_jr.  Yes.
walter_white_jr.  are now. That doesn't
walter_white  doesn't count!
walter_white  know you don't approve.
walter_white  But mine we'll call a birthday present to myself.
walter_white  And Junior's
walter_white  People will just chalk that up as me being a softy.
walter_white  And besides I didn't actually buy either one.
walter_white  They're both leases.
walter_white  So it all fits our story.
walter_white  We can afford it now.
skyler_white  You're back at it?
walter_white  Well, yeah.
walter_white  We have to make up that 600,000 we lost.
skyler_white  What do you think about boarding school?
walter_white  Boarding school?
walter_white  For who?
walter_white  For Junior?
skyler_white  There's this place in northern Arizona and it's supposed to be one of the top 10 in the country.
walter_white  He's a year away from college. Why
walter_white  Why on earth would we do that?
skyler_white  I I don't know
skyler_white  know.
skyler_white  Just thinking about the kids.
walter_white  Holly too?
walter_white  Where are we sending our 8monthold?

skyler_white  No
skyler_white  No. I just A new environment might be good for them.
walter_white  What does that mean?
walter_white  What's wrong with their environment?
walter_white  What's wrong with their environment?
walter_white  Listen, I know these last few weeks have been rough.
walter_white  The threat to Hank and this whole thing with Beneke.
walter_white  But there's absolutely nothing for you to be afraid of anymore, okay?
walter_white  I mean, clear sailing from here on out. I
walter_white  I promise.
walter_white  us to try and start looking forward to things again.
walter_white  Speaking of which, my birthday.
walter_white  don't know I don't know what you have planned and with everything that's been going on lately I'd understand if you haven't even given it a thought.
walter_white  But I think a little celebration might be good.
walter_white  For all of us.
walter_white  You know, a birthday party.
walter_white  What do you think?
skyler_white  And
walter_white  And maybe, if I may be so bold chocolate cake with chocolate icing?
walter_white  Life is good, Skyler.
walter_white  Thank you.
walter_white_jr.  Hey, Mom, you forgot something.
walter_white_jr.  Dad's bacon.
walter_white  okay. I
walter_white  I can do it.
walter_white_jr.  No.
walter_white_jr.  Mom has to.
walter_white  is sort of a tradition.
walter_white  Watch this, Holly.
walter_white  Watch what she does with bacon.
walter_white  Watch.
walter_white  What is she doing?
walter_white  she doing?
walter_white_jr.  That's a pretty small" 1
walter_white  Kind of is.
walter_white  Just a little
walter_white  Now you're talking.
unknown  No. No
walter_white  Good move.
walter_white_jr.  No
walter_white  No, no, no. It's
walter_white  It's good. Very good.
walter_white  Family
walter_white  Family teamwork. Making
walter_white  Making sacrifices.
walter_white  Very important.
walter_white_jr.  Happy birthday, Dad.
walter_white  Thank you, buddy.
walter_white  You want some?
hank_schrader  some piece of work, isn't he
hank_schrader  Six feet under and half a face, he's still screwing with us.
steven_gomez  So
hank_schrader  what's next? I don't know. I don't know. This Madrigal thing seems hinky, though, you know?
hank_schrader  We got Burgermeister Meisterburger in Germany and 5000 miles away, you got this guy.
hank_schrader  There's gotta be someone in the middle, you know?
hank_schrader  Someone we're missing. What
hank_schrader  about that Lydia what'shername?
hank_schrader  Lady Banjo Eyes at the warehouse?
steven_gomez  In this world?
steven_gomez  way.
steven_gomez  Too uptight.
steven_gomez  Too together.
hank_schrader  Maybe.
hank_schrader  She was wearing mismatched shoes.
hank_schrader  How together can she be?
ramey  Gentlemen, how goes it with Fring?
hank_schrader  You know, just working through the grief.
ramey  How soon before you submit a final?
hank_schrader  Well, we've been kicking around some ideas.
hank_schrader  Had you asked a couple of weeks ago I'd have said this was a mopup job, but
ramey  But?
hank_schrader  None of Fring's crew is talking to us.
hank_schrader  I mean, not a peep, no matter how hard we squeeze.
hank_schrader  Makes it likely there's somebody keeping them in line.
hank_schrader  Our money is on this guy, Michael Ehrmantraut. He's
hank_schrader  He's Fring's head of" corporate security.
steven_gomez  He's a definite hard case.
hank_schrader  Now, we're gonna stay on him
hank_schrader  We're putting together a surveillance team as we speak.
hank_schrader  Okay?
hank_schrader  The other thing is
hank_schrader  may be unrelated but the blue meth is making a bit of a comeback.
hank_schrader  Tell him
steven_gomez  Yeah. Some
steven_gomez  Some small amounts on the streetside pulls.
steven_gomez  Lab's telling us it's the same stuff.
hank_schrader  I mean, it could be old inventory leaking out or it could be somebody's rebooting using Fring's former cooks to set up a new operation.
ramey  I thought we had Fring's cooks.
ramey  The unsubs in the lab fire.
ramey  Thought maybe one of them was your Heisenberg.
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  Maybe.
hank_schrader  know.
hank_schrader  Like I said, there's still a lot of questions.
ramey  Agent Gomez, could you give us a moment?
steven_gomez  Yeah
ramey  Hank, I gotta say, your work here has been stellar.
ramey  Really firstrate.
hank_schrader  Thank you, sir.
ramey  So much so that I'm wondering if it's time you made a change.
ramey  You know I have to get back to El Paso.
ramey  This office needs an ASAC and I'm thinking we should be promoting from within.
ramey  you were to put in an application and I recommend that you do, you will get the job.
ramey  I have no doubt this D. O. would be well served with you at the helm.
hank_schrader  I'm not sure what to say.
ramey  It's a big step up.
ramey  not without its headaches.
ramey  politics may take some getting used to.
ramey  You'd be overseeing every case in the office so you'd need to reassign all your daytodays, Fring included.
ramey  Much as I hate losing a good field man that's the job, and you need to be okay with it.
ramey  What do you say, Hank?
ramey  You want it?
hank_schrader  Well, considering my wife would murder me if I said" no"
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  I want it
ramey  Congratulations.
hank_schrader  Thank you.

walter_white  But Skyler
walter_white  She was right there, of course putting wet washcloths on my forehead.
walter_white  she's singing to me.
walter_white  And this would go on and on day after day.
walter_white  I remember I was lying on the floor of the bathroom because the tile felt nice and cool, you know?
walter_white  my head was in Skyler's lap and I was just asking her if this could all be over.
walter_white  It was too hard.
walter_white  It was I just wanted it stopped. Skyler

jesse_pinkman  with, like, a forklift
jesse_pinkman  You got one?
lydia_rodarte-quayle  Please

hank_schrader  Has anything like this ever happened before?
walter_white  No, of course not
walter_white  no. I just
walter_white  have been having some issues.
hank_schrader  yeah.
hank_schrader  I might've heard a little bit about that.
hank_schrader  I mean, hey, look, Marie didn't go into detail.
hank_schrader  She just, you know, said that, you know, you guys were having some issues.
hank_schrader  So, what's the next move?
hank_schrader  Might be good to have her talk to someone.
walter_white  I agree.
hank_schrader  Yeah
walter_white  I'm gonna get on that first thing.
hank_schrader  There's Marie's guy, Dave. She
hank_schrader  She seems really happy with him
hank_schrader  that Marie's an advertisement for advanced mental health or anything
hank_schrader  know I
walter_white  just had no idea she was taking it this hard.
hank_schrader  Some birthday, huh?
marie_schrader  Okay
marie_schrader  What was that?
walter_white  don't know
marie_schrader  I mean, was she trying?
hank_schrader  No, not in a swimming pool. No.
hank_schrader  With all of us there?
hank_schrader  No, I don't think so.
hank_schrader  But we both think that she should talk to someone.
marie_schrader  get you Dave's
walter_white  Dave's number
marie_schrader  Listen, Walt, I I can't help but sense that there may be some issues between you and Skyler.
marie_schrader  None of our business, of course.
marie_schrader  And, Hank, I don't know if you've picked up on
hank_schrader  on any
hank_schrader  the He knows. He knows I know
marie_schrader  These things happen in a marriage but it isn't unfixable.
marie_schrader  I think what would be great is if you two had some space to work through this stuff.
marie_schrader  And keep an open mind here.
marie_schrader  What if we took the kids for a while?
walter_white  Took the kids?
marie_schrader  Absolutely. We'll
marie_schrader  We'll look after them for a day or two, or however long and leave you and Skyler to look after each other.
walter_white  That's very generous of you, Marie but I I just don't see how that's a solution.
walter_white  And, I mean
walter_white  Besides, Junior and Holly, that's a lot of work.
marie_schrader  No, it isn't.
marie_schrader  Junior's independent and my niece is only the easiest most delicious baby that was ever born.
marie_schrader  be fun, right?
hank_schrader  Yeah. No
hank_schrader  No, yeah.
hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  Absolutely
hank_schrader  Absolutely.
hank_schrader  Yeah. It's
hank_schrader  good idea.
marie_schrader  Well, I think it's a great idea.
marie_schrader  Just the thing for both of
walter_white  you. Marie
walter_white  idea Was it yours?
marie_schrader  Actually, it was Skyler's.
marie_schrader  She really needs this, Walt.
walter_white  Yep
walter_white  I gave Marie bottles.
walter_white  They'll stop and pick up diapers along the way.
walter_white  I spoke with Junior on the phone and after much discussion he agreed to swing by tomorrow, pick up some clothes.
walter_white  And so voilÃ the kids are out of this environment.
walter_white  What a coincidence.
walter_white  I know you're awake.
walter_white  What was that about
walter_white  Can you explain it
skyler_white  I don't want the children here anymore.
skyler_white  It isn't safe.
walter_white  Skyler, we have talked about this repeatedly.
walter_white  It has never been more safe.
skyler_white " Never been"
skyler_white  A couple weeks ago, a man was coming to this house to kill us, to murder your entire family.
skyler_white  You were in the crawlspace, screaming.
walter_white  And I dealt with him.
walter_white  It's over.
skyler_white  It is not.
skyler_white  You're right back in the meth business again.
walter_white  This is different.
walter_white  Now I'm running things.
skyler_white  Now
skyler_white  Now that you're in charge it's what? It's
skyler_white  It's gonna be smooth sailing from here on out?
walter_white  I don't see why not.
walter_white  I keep the work at work, Skyler and nothing will ever impact you or the kids.
skyler_white  You don't know that.
skyler_white  You can't make that promise, Walt.
walter_white  I can promise you that Gus Fring is dead.
walter_white  And he was the threat.
walter_white  He was the danger.
skyler_white  thought you were the danger.
walter_white  that what your pool stunt was about?
walter_white  to protect my children from me?
skyler_white  Not just you
skyler_white  There's blood on my hands too.
walter_white  What blood?
walter_white  Beneke?
skyler_white  He's in the hospital because of me.
walter_white  Because
skyler_white  Because of what I did.
walter_white  Skyler, you can't beat yourself up over this thing.
walter_white  Please.
walter_white  You didn't set out to hurt anybody.
walter_white  You made a mistake, and things got out of control but you did what you had to to protect your family.
walter_white  I'm sorry.
walter_white  That doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a human being.
skyler_white  Stop it, Walt.
skyler_white  Just stop.
skyler_white  I don't need to hear any of your bullshit rationales.
skyler_white  I'm in it now.
skyler_white  I'm compromised.
skyler_white  But I won't I
skyler_white  I will not have my children living in a house where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people is shrugged off as" shit happens.
skyler_white  We're back at it?
skyler_white  Fine.
skyler_white  But the kids stay away, and that's that.
walter_white  That's that"
walter_white  That's what? I
skyler_white  I got them out of this house.
walter_white  To a sleepover at their aunt and uncle's?
walter_white  They spend a day or two Junior stays up late watching movies, and then what happens?
skyler_white  We'll see.
walter_white  No, I'll tell you what happens.
walter_white  They come home to this house, to their parents who love them.
skyler_white  No.
skyler_white  I will not let our business endanger them.
walter_white  How many times do I have to say that they are not in?
skyler_white  I said no.
skyler_white  I swear to God, I won't have them back here.
walter_white  What are you gonna do to stop it
skyler_white  takes.
skyler_white  Everything in my power.
walter_white  Like what
walter_white  I mean, specifically.
walter_white  What is your next move
skyler_white  next move is maybe I hurt myself.
skyler_white  Make it clear we need more time.
skyler_white  Let Hank and Marie see we're still struggling. No
walter_white  No, more like you're still struggling. So
walter_white  So maybe next time, I have you committed.
walter_white  Put you in some inpatient facility while I take care of the kids myself.
walter_white  Is that what you want?
skyler_white  then maybe I show up with bruises on my neck give myself a black eye say that you beat me when you found out about my lover.
walter_white  see.
walter_white  So you want to involve Ted?
walter_white  Oh, well, that'll be fun bringing the police up to speed on all of that.
walter_white  But not as much fun as telling your 16yearold son that his father is a wifebeater.
walter_white  Also not a very good plan.
walter_white  What else you got?
skyler_white  I could send Junior away to school.
walter_white  here's the conversation :
walter_white  So, honey, I know you've only got one year left in high school but I would love it if you'd drop everything leave all your friends behind, and go to boarding school in Arizona.
walter_white " You have any other ideas? Because
walter_white  Because I'm not hearing a solution to your problem.
walter_white  How are you going to save our kids from this terrible environment?
skyler_white  I don't What
walter_white  What are you gonna do?
walter_white  Run off to France?
walter_white  You gonna close the curtains, change the locks?
walter_white  This is a joke. Come
walter_white  Come on, Skyler.
walter_white  You wanna take me on?
walter_white  You wanna take away my children?
walter_white  What's the plan
skyler_white  plan? I don't know
skyler_white  is the best I could come up with, okay?
skyler_white  I will count every minute that the kids are away from here away from you, as a victory.
skyler_white  But you're right.
skyler_white  It's a bad plan.
skyler_white  I don't have any of your magic, Walt.
skyler_white  I don't know what to do.
skyler_white  I'm a coward.
skyler_white  I I can't go to the police.
skyler_white  I can't stop laundering your money.
skyler_white  I can't keep you out of this house.
skyler_white  I can't even keep you out of my bed.
skyler_white  All I can do is wait.
skyler_white  That's it.
skyler_white  That's the only good option.
skyler_white  Hold on, bide my time and wait.
walter_white  Wait for what?
walter_white  What are you waiting for? For
skyler_white  the cancer to come back.
walter_white  Okay.
walter_white  Just relax.
walter_white  I'm coming.
jesse_pinkman  Look at that.
jesse_pinkman  You tell me what that looks like.
jesse_pinkman  If the DEA's tracking her barrels, there goes our precursor connection.
jesse_pinkman  That's done.
jesse_pinkman  And I'm telling you, these days chances of getting a new methylamine hookup is rare, man.
jesse_pinkman  It's like Bigfoot.
jesse_pinkman  Like unicornrare. Kid
mike_ehrmantraut  Kid, it's just You're giving me heartburn here.
mike_ehrmantraut  GPS on the bottom of the barrel.
mike_ehrmantraut  Why didn't they put it inside where nobody would see it
jesse_pinkman  Look, it's inside, it gets wet.
mike_ehrmantraut  They made these things to put under cars.
mike_ehrmantraut  It can get wet.
mike_ehrmantraut  Even by cop standards, this is sloppy.
mike_ehrmantraut  And the other barrels they have trackers on the outside too?
jesse_pinkman  know.
jesse_pinkman  Probably.
mike_ehrmantraut  You didn't check any of the other barrels?
jesse_pinkman  But
jesse_pinkman  that's the only one we could've taken according to her.
jesse_pinkman  Once we spotted it, she freaked out, I put the barrel back, and we F. O. 'd.
mike_ehrmantraut  Let me ask you something
mike_ehrmantraut  The person who spotted this was it you or was it her?
jesse_pinkman  Lydia.
jesse_pinkman  She saw it first.
mike_ehrmantraut  Okay.
mike_ehrmantraut  She's dead.
jesse_pinkman  What?
jesse_pinkman  Lydia
mike_ehrmantraut  Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.
mike_ehrmantraut  She's thinking if she makes it look like her inventory's being watched that we'll leave her alone and take our business elsewhere.
mike_ehrmantraut  And she's right.
mike_ehrmantraut  We will be taking our business elsewhere right after I leave her alone in a ditch.
jesse_pinkman  wait, hey, if the DEA's not tracking her stuff that's a good thing, right?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, all we gotta do is tell her to cut the crap and keep the methylamine coming.
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't know this woman like I do.
mike_ehrmantraut  I had a chance to deal with this before, and I gave her a pass.
mike_ehrmantraut  That's what I get for being sexist.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, if you'll excuse me
jesse_pinkman  Mike, you can't just
jesse_pinkman  that's our precursor.
jesse_pinkman  We need her.
mike_ehrmantraut  Kid, if we have to ramp down for a while, so be it.
mike_ehrmantraut  It beats working with a lunatic who's gonna get us arrested or killed
jesse_pinkman  killed. Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you know
jesse_pinkman  know? She just seemed, like, uptight.
mike_ehrmantraut  And now you're being sexist.
mike_ehrmantraut  Trust me, this woman deserves to die as much as any man I've ever met.
jesse_pinkman  Wait!
jesse_pinkman  Just wait.
jesse_pinkman  if this really was the cops, you know?
jesse_pinkman  And what if you're wrong about her?
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm not wrong.
jesse_pinkman  But what if you are
mike_ehrmantraut  Jesse, your misgivings have been duly noted.
mike_ehrmantraut  Now move away from me.
jesse_pinkman  This is a voting thing.
mike_ehrmantraut  I don't think so. I
jesse_pinkman  I vote it's a voting thing.
jesse_pinkman  Mr. White, weigh in here, would you?
jesse_pinkman  do you think?
jesse_pinkman  Mr. White?
walter_white  The methylamine keeps flowing, no matter what.
walter_white  We are not ramping down.
walter_white  We're just getting started.
walter_white  Nothing stops this train.
jesse_pinkman  Hey,
jesse_pinkman  yo, Mr. White. Hold up. Hey, I just
jesse_pinkman  I liked your idea. You know, it's pretty I think it's the way to go.
jesse_pinkman  Oh, hey.
jesse_pinkman  You said it was your birthday, so I left the receipt in the box in case you wanna exchange it
jesse_pinkman  Anyway, hey, happy birthday.
walter_white  I stopped by Hank and Marie's.
walter_white  Junior is still asking," What is going on?
walter_white  Nonstop, very insistently.
walter_white  But everything's okay.
walter_white  They're watching Ratatouille.
walter_white  It's very sweet.
walter_white  There's gonna be some more money coming in soon.
walter_white  that okay?
skyler_white  Fine.
walter_white  So
walter_white  coming to bed?
walter_white  I wanna show you something.
walter_white  It
walter_white  a birthday present.
walter_white  person who gave me this present wanted me dead too.
walter_white  Not that long ago he pointed a gun right between my eyes, right here and he threatened to kill me.
walter_white  He changed his mind about me, Skyler and so will you.
