#unknown Gotta say, when you first brought her in, I had my doubts.
#unknown But your little darling's got nine lives.
#unknown Rearwheel assembly took the brunt of the impact.
#unknown So Yeah.
#unknown CV shaft, boots, joints, axle Replaced all of it.
#unknown No way around it.
#unknown I went aftermarket on most of the parts here.
#unknown You want me to swap in factory parts, that's fine.
#unknown But using aftermarket's the only way we'll keep it under Blue Book and on the insurance company's dime, okay? Nothing beats free.
#unknown Swapped out your air filter, topped off your fluids.
#unknown Didn't have to replace the windshield this time.
#unknown I know, right? Oh, and I noticed you had some sort of gunky buildup in the front end here.
#unknown First, I had no idea what I was looking at.
#unknown Then I remembered you had me replace that front fender a few months back when you ran over that deer.
#unknown We went at it with the steam hose, cleaned it up for you.
#unknown Hardest part was the paint.
#unknown Fern green.
#unknown Interesting tint.
#unknown Anything else? That's it.
#unknown Zero balance, like I said.
#unknown Sign here, you're good to go.
#unknown People like to joke but I really, really like this car.
#unknown She's sturdy as all hell.
#unknown I'm betting you get another 200,000 miles out of her.
#unknown Hey, Benny.
#unknown What would you give me for it?  What's the Blue Book, you mean?  No.
#unknown I mean, what will you pay me for this car?  Well, I'm not really looking for  A hundred dollars? Fifty? Insurance company just shelled out Then it's a bargain.
#unknown You give me 50 bucks, and she's all yours.
#unknown You sure about this? Sure as shooting.
#unknown I'll check the register.
#unknown Dad? Fifty bucks? Are you crazy?  Gotta be kidding me.
#unknown Lydia? Oh, Christ.
#unknown I'm at work right now.
#unknown Yeah, I know.
#unknown This is a headsup.
#unknown You got visitors.
#unknown Visitors? What? You mean today? I mean 30 seconds.
#unknown Come in.
#unknown Ms.
#unknown RodarteQuayle? Agent Hank Schrader, Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.
#unknown We met briefly in Albuquerque.
#unknown Yes, we did.
#unknown What can I do for you? There.
#unknown The foreman.
#unknown Navy pants, powderblue shirt.
#unknown Hey, buddy.
#unknown Yeah?  They got Ron.
#unknown Ron's done.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Not okay, Mike.
#unknown Not okay.
#unknown The The look he just gave me was the very antithesis of "okay," okay? Breathe, Lydia.
#unknown No one's talking to the police.
#unknown I just had like 14 DEA agents barge into my office, screaming and yelling at me and they were swarming all over the warehouse, okay? The warehouse.
#unknown Besides, Ron was my guy.
#unknown Remember? I don't have a guy anymore.
#unknown Ron fixed security, pulled the barrels, drove the truck.
#unknown You can't expect me to do that stuff.
#unknown I mean, let's be realistic.
#unknown Mike, this is crazy.
#unknown I'll send a new guy.
#unknown You're crazy.
#unknown My car almost has 500 horsepower.
#unknown It would totally smoke  Horsepower isn't everything.
#unknown Don't you know that? You have to factor in drag and torque and suspension and weight of the car.
#unknown One more factor that you're not thinking about: The experience of the driver.
#unknown I totally got you there.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Please.
#unknown You drive like a geezer  I got you.
#unknown Really? I drive like a gee Tell me, can a geezer do donuts? I don't think so.
#unknown Bullshit you ever did donuts.
#unknown Watch your language.
#unknown And, yes, I did.
#unknown Seriously? Yes, seriously.
#unknown And if you show me just a modicum of respect, maybe I'll teach you.
#unknown Yeah? Yes?  No.
#unknown No, I won't.
#unknown I take that back.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown No.
#unknown You're saying yes.
#unknown Just a joke.
#unknown I'm just No! No, no.
#unknown That was kidding.
#unknown We didn't shake on it.
#unknown No.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown We are now.
#unknown That doesn't count! I know you don't approve.
#unknown But mine we'll call a birthday present to myself.
#unknown And Junior's People will just chalk that up as me being a softy.
#unknown And besides I didn't actually buy either one.
#unknown They're both leases.
#unknown So it all fits our story.
#unknown Okay? We can afford it now.
#unknown You're back at it? Well, yeah.
#unknown We have to make up that 600,000 we lost.
#unknown What do you think about boarding school? Boarding school? For who? For Junior? Yeah.
#unknown There's this place in northern Arizona and it's supposed to be one of the top 10 in the country.
#unknown He's a year away from college.
#unknown Why on earth would we do that? I I don't know.
#unknown I just Just thinking about the kids.
#unknown Holly too? Where are we sending our 8monthold? Peace Corps? No.
#unknown I just A new environment might be good for them.
#unknown What does that mean? What's wrong with their environment? Skyler.
#unknown What's wrong with their environment? Nothing.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Listen, I know these last few weeks have been rough.
#unknown The threat to Hank and this whole thing with Beneke.
#unknown But there's absolutely nothing for you to be afraid of anymore, okay? I mean, clear sailing from here on out.
#unknown I promise.
#unknown You know, I want us to try and start looking forward to things again.
#unknown Speaking of which, my birthday.
#unknown I don't know I don't know what you have planned and with everything that's been going on lately I'd understand if you haven't even given it a thought.
#unknown But I think a little celebration might be good.
#unknown For all of us.
#unknown You know, a birthday party.
#unknown What do you think? Yeah? Okay.
#unknown And maybe, if I may be so bold chocolate cake with chocolate icing? Life is good, Skyler.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Hey, Mom, you forgot something.
#unknown Dad's bacon.
#unknown That's okay.
#unknown I can do it.
#unknown No.
#unknown Mom has to.
#unknown Well, it is sort of a tradition.
#unknown Watch this, Holly.
#unknown Watch what she does with bacon.
#unknown Watch.
#unknown Watch this.
#unknown What is she doing? What is she doing? That's a pretty small "1 Kind of is.
#unknown Just a little.
#unknown Now you're talking.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Good move.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown It's good.
#unknown Very good.
#unknown Family teamwork.
#unknown Making sacrifices.
#unknown Very important.
#unknown Happy birthday, Dad.
#unknown Thank you, buddy.
#unknown You want some? Guy's some piece of work, isn't he? Six feet under and half a face, he's still screwing with us.
#unknown So, what's next? I don't know.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown This Madrigal thing seems hinky, though, you know? We got Burgermeister Meisterburger in Germany and 5000 miles away, you got this guy.
#unknown There's gotta be someone in the middle, you know? Someone we're missing.
#unknown What about that Lydia what'shername? Lady Banjo Eyes at the warehouse? In this world? No way.
#unknown Too uptight.
#unknown Too together.
#unknown Maybe.
#unknown She was wearing mismatched shoes.
#unknown How together can she be? Gentlemen, how goes it with Fring? You know, just working through the grief.
#unknown How soon before you submit a final? Well, we've been kicking around some ideas.
#unknown Had you asked a couple of weeks ago I'd have said this was a mopup job, but  But?  None of Fring's crew is talking to us.
#unknown I mean, not a peep, no matter how hard we squeeze.
#unknown Makes it likely there's somebody keeping them in line.
#unknown Our money is on this guy, Michael Ehrmantraut.
#unknown He's Fring's head of "corporate security.
#unknown "  He's a definite hard case.
#unknown Now, we're gonna stay on him.
#unknown We're putting together a surveillance team as we speak.
#unknown Okay? The other thing is This may be unrelated but the blue meth is making a bit of a comeback.
#unknown Tell him, Gomey.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Some small amounts on the streetside pulls.
#unknown Lab's telling us it's the same stuff.
#unknown I mean, it could be old inventory leaking out or it could be somebody's rebooting using Fring's former cooks to set up a new operation.
#unknown I thought we had Fring's cooks.
#unknown The unsubs in the lab fire.
#unknown Thought maybe one of them was your Heisenberg.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Maybe.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Like I said, there's still a lot of questions.
#unknown Agent Gomez, could you give us a moment? Yeah.
#unknown Hank, I gotta say, your work here has been stellar.
#unknown Really firstrate.
#unknown Thank you, sir.
#unknown So much so that I'm wondering if it's time you made a change.
#unknown You know I have to get back to El Paso.
#unknown This office needs an ASAC and I'm thinking we should be promoting from within.
#unknown If you were to put in an application and I recommend that you do, you will get the job.
#unknown I have no doubt this D.
#unknown O.
#unknown would be well served with you at the helm.
#unknown That's I'm not sure what to say.
#unknown It's a big step up.
#unknown It's not without its headaches.
#unknown The politics may take some getting used to.
#unknown You'd be overseeing every case in the office so you'd need to reassign all your daytodays, Fring included.
#unknown Much as I hate losing a good field man that's the job, and you need to be okay with it.
#unknown What do you say, Hank? You want it? Well, considering my wife would murder me if I said "no" Yeah.
#unknown I want it.
#unknown Congratulations.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Can you finish up for me? It's It's my birthday.
#unknown Oh, yeah?  Yeah.
#unknown I probably have a birthday party waiting for me, you know, so Yeah.
#unknown Cool.
#unknown Yeah, no problem.
#unknown Hey, happy birthday.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Hey, Dad.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Where's your mom? Kitchen.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown So, what's the plan? Hank and Marie are on their way.
#unknown Roast chicken and potatoes for dinner, rocky road for dessert and chocolate cake, as requested.
#unknown What's up? Me? Nothing.
#unknown Thought you'd be more jazzed about the new job.
#unknown No.
#unknown What? No.
#unknown I am.
#unknown Baby, I'm so proud of you.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Sorry, sorry.
#unknown I believe you.
#unknown Just don't kill us here.
#unknown Marie, you've been moping around the last few days.
#unknown Marie? What's up?  Marie, come on.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I I made a promise to someone.
#unknown To who?  Who?  Your brotherinlaw.
#unknown Are you gonna give me a hint at least?  It involves infidelity.
#unknown That's all I'll say.
#unknown Oh, shit.
#unknown I knew it.
#unknown Knew what? What did you? What did you know? Well, I mean, I didn't know it, but I've been, you know, saying it forever.
#unknown Walt's second cell phone, you know? Sorry, babe, but I was way ahead of you on this one.
#unknown Way ahead of me.
#unknown Well, it wasn't Walt.
#unknown Skyler? No way.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey! There she is.
#unknown Hey! Hi!  Hey!  Hey, buddy.
#unknown Hey, pal.
#unknown Welcome.
#unknown Welcome.
#unknown Come on in.
#unknown Happy birthday.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown I'm in the centre lane going about 60.
#unknown I had no choice but to just tear butt out of there.
#unknown Just: So sweet.
#unknown Highway patrol's gonna be sweet on it too.
#unknown Gonna get their ticket quota in a month.
#unknown You'll help me out, right, Uncle Hank, now that you run the DEA? Oh, yeah.
#unknown For my spoiledbrat, carwashmillionaire nephew? Sure.
#unknown I'll make sure you get a cell with a view.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Well, I'm out of here.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Happy birthday.
#unknown Thank you, buddy.
#unknown Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown I'll see y'all later.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown Be safe.
#unknown Have fun.
#unknown Drive safely, okay?  I do.
#unknown Slow down.
#unknown Never.
#unknown A hell of a couple cars there, Walt.
#unknown Honey, for my next birthday, I'm gonna take a page here from Walt and buy myself a jet plane.
#unknown Maybe I overdid it a little.
#unknown But with these new lease rates I mean, they're mighty attractive.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Great dinner, Skyler.
#unknown Those were some badass whipped potatoes, I'll tell you.
#unknown You have to tell me how you get all the lumps out.
#unknown How do you do that? A potato ricer.
#unknown A ricer? You don't handmash? No.
#unknown Well  Boy, it has It has been quite a year, huh? Do you know that it's almost exactly a year ago that I got my diagnosis?  Jesus.
#unknown Yeah, right?  Yeah.
#unknown It seems like longer, doesn't it?  Yeah.
#unknown No.
#unknown it's One year ago tomorrow.
#unknown The day after my 50th.
#unknown Honestly never thought I'd make it this far.
#unknown With the cancer and surgery and Hank being shot It just So many dark days.
#unknown Well There's Marie's talking pillow.
#unknown Remember that? It was effective.
#unknown Boy, I did not want to get any treatment.
#unknown I think I was too scared or too angry or I don't know.
#unknown I just wanted to quit.
#unknown But you guys You got me through it somehow.
#unknown Kept me going And that happened again and again and again.
#unknown I mean, there were times when I was sure I was done for.
#unknown But then someone or something would come through for me.
#unknown God.
#unknown And Skyler, I can't Honey, remember that first week of chemotherapy? That night on the bathroom floor? What you said to me? I was so sick.
#unknown It was rough going at first.
#unknown But Skyler She was right there, of course putting wet washcloths on my forehead.
#unknown And she's singing to me.
#unknown And this would go on and on day after day.
#unknown And I remember I was lying on the floor of the bathroom because the tile felt nice and cool, you know? And my head was in Skyler's lap and I was just asking her if this could all be over.
#unknown It was too hard.
#unknown It was I just wanted it stopped.
#unknown Skyler, isn't that freezing? Hey0.
#unknown Pool party.
#unknown What are you doing, Skyler? What is she doing? Walt? Hey, Sky, maybe it's time to get out now.
#unknown What do you think? Skyler, Hank asked you a question.
#unknown You need to get out Skyler! She's gonna come up, right? She has to.
#unknown Skyler! Oh, my God.
#unknown Wha? Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown It's gotta be Nope.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Come on! How am I supposed to? Hey.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Wait, wait.
#unknown Who are you? I'm the I'm the guy.
#unknown So where's the? Hold on.
#unknown Hold on.
#unknown Who sent you? Who sent me? Who do you think? No.
#unknown I'm asking you.
#unknown Mike.
#unknown And this Mike person What's his last name? Lady, I just got off a plane from New Mexico and I got a 900mile drive back.
#unknown That's 14 hours if I don't stop.
#unknown So the sooner we do this, the sooner it's done.
#unknown Ehrmantraut.
#unknown Okay? Satisfied? Sorry, but I'm not gonna apologise for being careful.
#unknown With all that's been happening, for all I knew you were one of those undercover people.
#unknown So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day over getting gangraped by prison guards.
#unknown No doubt.
#unknown So where's the? Up there.
#unknown Number 22356.
#unknown That's the one I erased from the inventory, so it has to be that one.
#unknown Can you reach it? Yeah, with, like, a forklift.
#unknown You got one? Wait, wait, wait! Stop!  Oh, my God.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown What? Please tell me that's not what I think it is.
#unknown Has anything like this ever happened before? No.
#unknown No, of course not.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown I just She and I have been having some issues.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown I might've heard a little bit about that.
#unknown I mean, hey, look, Marie didn't go into detail.
#unknown She just, you know, said that, you know, you guys were having some issues.
#unknown So, what's the next move? Might be good to have her talk to someone.
#unknown I agree.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm gonna get on that first thing.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown There's Marie's guy, Dave.
#unknown She seems really happy with him.
#unknown Not that Marie's an advertisement for advanced mental health or anything.
#unknown You know I just had no idea she was taking it this hard.
#unknown Some birthday, huh? She's gonna try and get some sleep.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown What was that? I don't know.
#unknown I mean, was she trying?  No, not in a swimming pool.
#unknown No.
#unknown With all of us there? No, I don't think so.
#unknown But we both think that she should talk to someone.
#unknown I'm gonna get you Dave's number.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Listen, Walt, I I can't help but sense that there may be some issues between you and Skyler.
#unknown None of our business, of course.
#unknown And, Hank, I don't know if you've  picked up on any of the  He knows.
#unknown He knows I know.
#unknown These things happen in a marriage but it isn't unfixable.
#unknown I think what would be great is if you two had some space to work through this stuff.
#unknown So And keep an open mind here.
#unknown What if we took the kids for a while?  Took the kids?  Absolutely.
#unknown We'll look after them for a day or two, or however long and leave you and Skyler to look after each other.
#unknown That's very generous of you, Marie but I I just don't see how that's a solution.
#unknown And, I mean Besides, Junior and Holly, that's a lot of work.
#unknown No, it isn't.
#unknown Junior's independent and my niece is only the easiest most delicious baby that was ever born.
#unknown It'll be fun, right?  Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown No, yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's a good idea.
#unknown Well, I think it's a great idea.
#unknown Just the thing for both of you.
#unknown Marie, this idea Was it yours? Actually, it was Skyler's.
#unknown She really needs this, Walt.
#unknown Yep.
#unknown I gave Marie bottles.
#unknown They'll stop and pick up diapers along the way.
#unknown I spoke with Junior on the phone and after much discussion he agreed to swing by tomorrow, pick up some clothes.
#unknown And so voilÃ  the kids are out of this environment.
#unknown What a coincidence.
#unknown I know you're awake.
#unknown What was that about? Can you explain it? I don't want the children here anymore.
#unknown It isn't safe.
#unknown Skyler, we have talked about this repeatedly.
#unknown It has never been more safe.
#unknown "Never been"? A couple weeks ago, a man was coming to this house to kill us, to murder your entire family.
#unknown You were in the crawlspace, screaming.
#unknown And I dealt with him.
#unknown It's over.
#unknown It is not.
#unknown You're right back in the meth business again.
#unknown This is different.
#unknown Now I'm running things.
#unknown So wait.
#unknown Now that you're in charge it's what? It's gonna be smooth sailing from here on out? I don't see why not.
#unknown I keep the work at work, Skyler and nothing will ever impact you or the kids.
#unknown You don't know that.
#unknown You can't make that promise, Walt.
#unknown I can promise you that Gus Fring is dead.
#unknown And he was the threat.
#unknown He was the danger.
#unknown I thought you were the danger.
#unknown Is that what your pool stunt was about? Trying to protect my children from me? Not just you.
#unknown There's blood on my hands too.
#unknown What blood? Beneke? He's in the hospital because of me.
#unknown No.
#unknown Because of what I did.
#unknown Skyler, you can't beat yourself up over this thing.
#unknown Please.
#unknown You didn't set out to hurt anybody.
#unknown You made a mistake, and things got out of control but you did what you had to to protect your family.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown That doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a human being.
#unknown Stop it, Walt.
#unknown Just stop.
#unknown I don't need to hear any of your bullshit rationales.
#unknown I'm in it now.
#unknown I'm compromised.
#unknown But I won't I will not have my children living in a house where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people is shrugged off as "shit happens.
#unknown " We're back at it? Fine.
#unknown But the kids stay away, and that's that.
#unknown "That's that"? That's what? I got them out of this house.
#unknown To a sleepover at their aunt and uncle's? They spend a day or two Junior stays up late watching movies, and then what happens?  We'll see.
#unknown No, I'll tell you what happens.
#unknown They come home to this house, to their parents who love them.
#unknown No.
#unknown I will not let our business endanger them.
#unknown How many times do I have to say  that they are not in?  I said no.
#unknown I swear to God, I won't have them back here.
#unknown What are you gonna do to stop it? Whatever it takes.
#unknown Everything in my power.
#unknown Like what? I mean, specifically.
#unknown What is your next move? My next move is maybe I hurt myself.
#unknown Make it clear we need more time.
#unknown Let Hank and Marie see we're still struggling.
#unknown No, more like you're still struggling.
#unknown So maybe next time, I have you committed.
#unknown Put you in some inpatient facility while I take care of the kids myself.
#unknown Is that what you want? So then maybe I show up with bruises on my neck give myself a black eye say that you beat me when you found out about my lover.
#unknown I see.
#unknown So you want to involve Ted? Oh, well, that'll be fun bringing the police up to speed on all of that.
#unknown But not as much fun as telling your 16yearold son that his father is a wifebeater.
#unknown Also not a very good plan.
#unknown What else you got?  I could send Junior away to school.
#unknown Now here's the conversation: "So, honey, I know you've only got one year left in high school but I would love it if you'd drop everything leave all your friends behind, and go to boarding school in Arizona.
#unknown " You have any other ideas? Because I'm not hearing a solution to your problem.
#unknown How are you going to save our kids from this terrible environment?  I don't  What are you gonna do? Run off to France? You gonna close the curtains, change the locks? This is a joke.
#unknown Come on, Skyler.
#unknown You wanna take me on? You wanna take away my children?  What's the plan?  I don't know! This is the best I could come up with, okay? I will count every minute that the kids are away from here away from you, as a victory.
#unknown But you're right.
#unknown It's a bad plan.
#unknown I don't have any of your magic, Walt.
#unknown I don't know what to do.
#unknown I'm a coward.
#unknown I I can't go to the police.
#unknown I can't stop laundering your money.
#unknown I can't keep you out of this house.
#unknown I can't even keep you out of my bed.
#unknown All I can do is wait.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown That's the only good option.
#unknown Hold on, bide my time and wait.
#unknown Wait for what? What are you waiting for? For the cancer to come back.
#unknown Yeah? Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Just relax.
#unknown I'm coming.
#unknown Look at that.
#unknown You tell me what that looks like.
#unknown If the DEA's tracking her barrels, there goes our precursor connection.
#unknown That's done.
#unknown And I'm telling you, these days chances of getting a new methylamine hookup is rare, man.
#unknown It's like Bigfoot.
#unknown Like unicornrare.
#unknown Kid, it's just You're giving me heartburn here.
#unknown GPS on the bottom of the barrel.
#unknown Why didn't they put it inside where nobody would see it? Look, it's inside, it gets wet.
#unknown They made these things to put under cars.
#unknown It can get wet.
#unknown Even by cop standards, this is sloppy.
#unknown And the other barrels they have trackers on the outside too? I don't know.
#unknown Probably.
#unknown You didn't check any of the other barrels? No.
#unknown But that's the only one we could've taken according to her.
#unknown Once we spotted it, she freaked out, I put the barrel back, and we F.
#unknown O.
#unknown 'd.
#unknown Let me ask you something.
#unknown The person who spotted this was it you or was it her? Lydia.
#unknown She saw it first.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown She's dead.
#unknown Wait, wait, wait.
#unknown What? Lydia planted this thing, not the cops.
#unknown She's thinking if she makes it look like her inventory's being watched that we'll leave her alone and take our business elsewhere.
#unknown And she's right.
#unknown We will be taking our business elsewhere right after I leave her alone in a ditch.
#unknown But wait, hey, if the DEA's not tracking her stuff that's a good thing, right? I mean, all we gotta do is tell her to cut the crap and keep the methylamine coming.
#unknown You don't know this woman like I do.
#unknown I had a chance to deal with this before, and I gave her a pass.
#unknown That's what I get for being sexist.
#unknown Now, if you'll excuse me  Mike, you can't just Look, that's our precursor.
#unknown We need her.
#unknown Kid, if we have to ramp down for a while, so be it.
#unknown It beats working with a lunatic who's gonna get us arrested or killed.
#unknown Look, she didn't seem crazy to me, you know? She just seemed, like, uptight.
#unknown And now you're being sexist.
#unknown Trust me, this woman deserves to die as much as any man I've ever met.
#unknown Wait! Just wait.
#unknown What if this really was the cops, you know?  And what if you're wrong about her?  I'm not wrong.
#unknown But what if you are? Jesse, your misgivings have been duly noted.
#unknown Now move away from me.
#unknown No.
#unknown This is a voting thing.
#unknown I don't think so.
#unknown I vote it's a voting thing.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, weigh in here, would you? What do you think? Mr.
#unknown White? The methylamine keeps flowing, no matter what.
#unknown We are not ramping down.
#unknown We're just getting started.
#unknown Nothing stops this train.
#unknown Nothing.
#unknown Hey, yo, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Hold up.
#unknown Hey, I just wanted to say I liked your idea.
#unknown You know, it's pretty I think it's the way to go.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown You said it was your birthday, so I left the receipt in the box in case you wanna exchange it.
#unknown Anyway, hey, happy birthday.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown I stopped by Hank and Marie's.
#unknown Junior is still asking, "What is going on?" Nonstop, very insistently.
#unknown But everything's okay.
#unknown They're watching Ratatouille.
#unknown It's very sweet.
#unknown How are you? There's gonna be some more money coming in soon.
#unknown Is that okay? Fine.
#unknown Good.
#unknown So You coming to bed? I wanna show you something.
#unknown See that watch? It was a birthday present.
#unknown The person who gave me this present wanted me dead too.
#unknown Not that long ago he pointed a gun right between my eyes, right here and he threatened to kill me.
#unknown He changed his mind about me, Skyler and so will you.
