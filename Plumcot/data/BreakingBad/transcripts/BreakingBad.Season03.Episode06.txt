cynthia  I'm just wondering if we should maybe call the police or something.
gustavo_fring  Why?
gustavo_fring  doing nothing wrong.
gale_boetticher  Mr. White, I presume?
walter_white  Oh, yes.
walter_white  Hi.
walter_white  I am
walter_white  Sorry.
walter_white  I'll be right down.
gale_boetticher  Hi. Gale Boetticher.
walter_white  You're my new lab assistant, I take it
gale_boetticher  I am.
gale_boetticher  I suppose you'll want to hear my qualifications.
gale_boetticher  have my, uh my resume here for
gale_boetticher  I received my bachelor's degree from UNM,
gale_boetticher  my master's from the University of Colorado.
gale_boetticher  Organic chemistry with a specialty in It's
gale_boetticher  right there.
Walter_White  Xray crystallography.
walter_white  Really.
walter_white  talk about that for hours.
gale_boetticher  I would
walter_white  to. Well, first, I'm curious about this.
gale_boetticher  That's a little pet project of mine.
gale_boetticher  See, in my opinion, it's all about the quinic acid level.
gale_boetticher  You want just north of 4,800 milligrams per liter, but if you overboil to get there, you're going to leach your tannins.
gale_boetticher  Bitterness. Yuck.
gale_boetticher  So I pull a mild vacuum.
gale_boetticher  That way, I can keep the temperature no higher than 92 C,
gale_boetticher  and uh Let's see. Judge for yourself.
walter_white  My God, that is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
gale_boetticher  Sumatran beans, and I also have to give credit to the grind, but, uh, thank you, Mr. White.
walter_white  Walt,
walter_white  please. Call me Walt.
walter_white  Huh, why the hell are we making meth?
gale_boetticher  Tell me, with the phenylacetic acid solution, you said 150 drops per minute for the first 10 minutes, and then 90 for the remainder.
gale_boetticher  Why is that?
walter_white  Well, my thinking is, by tapering the phenyl, you get an oilier aqueous layer, and hence
gale_boetticher  hence Better benzene extraction.
walter_white  Exactly.
walter_white  But actually I prefer ether.
gale_boetticher  Oh
walter_white  have it for tomorrow. Gale, I'm wondering how you
gale_boetticher  Ended up here.
walter_white  Well, actually, I'm still wondering how I ended up here, but, yes.
walter_white  I mean, I can't imagine we strike each other as criminals.
gale_boetticher  Well, there's crime, and then there's crime, I suppose.
gale_boetticher  I'm definitely a libertarian.
gale_boetticher  Consenting adults want what they want, and if I'm not supplying it, they will get it somewhere else.
gale_boetticher  At least with me, they're getting exactly what they pay for.
gale_boetticher  No added toxins or adulterants.
gale_boetticher  I was doing it the way you are supposed to, pursuing my doctorate at Colorado, NSF research grant.
gale_boetticher  I was on my way, jumping through hoops, kissing the proper behinds, attending to allhe nonchemistry that one finds oneself occupied with.
gale_boetticher  You know that world.
gale_boetticher  That is not what
gale_boetticher  I love the lab
gale_boetticher  Because it's all still magic.
gale_boetticher  You know?
gale_boetticher  Chemistry?
gale_boetticher  I mean, on you lose that It
gale_boetticher  is.
walter_white  It is magic.
walter_white  still is
gale_boetticher  And all the while I kept thinking about that great, old Whitman poem.
Gale_Boetticher  When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer.
walter_white  I I don't know it.
gale_boetticher  Uh,
walter_white  Well, can you recite it?
gale_boetticher  Pathetically enough I could.
walter_white  All right, well
walter_white  No, no, come on.
gale_boetticher  on. Yeah? When I heard the learn'd astronomer
Gale_Boetticher  the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me
gale_boetticher  ; When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to
gale_boetticher  to add, divide,
gale_boetticher  and measure them ; When I, sitting, heard the astronomer,
gale_boetticher  where he lectured with much applause in the
gale_boetticher  How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick ;
gale_boetticher  Till rising and gliding out, I wander'd off by myself,
gale_boetticher  In the mystical moist nightair,
gale_boetticher  and from time to time,
gale_boetticher  Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.
gale_boetticher  Yes,
gale_boetticher  I am a nerd.
gale_boetticher  Thank you.
