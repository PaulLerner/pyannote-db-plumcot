#unknown Good.
#unknown [door chimes ring] Now, I suggest that you add this to your Monday maintenance schedule.
#unknown Main valve on, main switch on.
#unknown Give the compressor time for the needle to enter the green.
#unknown You're for real.
#unknown This is all you? All me.
#unknown [Skinny Pete] Heisenberg who? That's what I say.
#unknown My man Jesse can cook.

#unknown It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.
#unknown Just the right shade of blue.
#unknown [Badger] Good shade.

#unknown like like anthrax.
#unknown [laughs] Good.
#unknown So, um You ready to talk some business? You mean, this is not, like, just recreational? Uhuh.
#unknown I know what you're thinking.
#unknown Trust me.
#unknown It's not going to be like it was all right, never gonna be like it was.
#unknown How's that? We sell it safe.
#unknown All right? We sell it smart.
#unknown We don't get greedy Like before.
#unknown I don't know, man.
#unknown Combo and all.
#unknown Still.
#unknown Man's gotta make his living.
#unknown If it's like Jesse says and we're not greedy I mean, I guess I can see it.
#unknown Had a good thing going before we started pushing our luck.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown If it can go back to being like that and all Hey, it will be.
#unknown Step 1 we build inventory.
#unknown Badger, go see Clovis.
#unknown Get the RV in shape tune up, oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.
#unknown Cops always pull you over for brake lights.
#unknown Not us.
#unknown Cautious.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown All right, you know that buzzer thing.
#unknown Leave the key in the ignition, and it buzzes, whatever.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Just have him put in one of those, too.
#unknown Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.
#unknown I'll get you a list.
#unknown [Skinny] Right on.
#unknown Yeah? [Badger] Yeah.
#unknown Let's do this.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So, uh we good? Yeah.
#unknown We good? Right on, man.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let's do this thing.
#unknown Brandon Mayhew.
#unknown I know you.
#unknown Small world, Albuquerque.
#unknown Want to talk about it? Why? It's not like I get a vote.
#unknown You know, ironically, I think you're going to see much more of me from now on.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Well, just as much of me at least.
#unknown I'm taking you to the school, to and from, every day.
#unknown What, I don't get a vote in this, either? I gotta stop going with Louis just because you're feeling guilty? I do feel guilty.
#unknown I am the man that I am, son, and there's plenty I would change about that, but Here we are and this is just what it is.
#unknown You know what? Call me crazy, but I'm actually feeling very good about the future.
#unknown Morning.
#unknown They're back.
#unknown Uh, I'm just wondering if we should maybe call the police or something.
#unknown Why? They're doing nothing wrong.
#unknown Okay, let's put this on table 33, okay? [clatters, buzzing] [Man] Hello, there.
#unknown Uh, Mr.
#unknown White, I presume? Oh, yes.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown I am Sorry.
#unknown I'll be right down.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Gale Boetticher.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown You're my new lab assistant, I take it.
#unknown Yes, I am.
#unknown I suppose you'll want to hear my qualifications.
#unknown I have my, uh my resume here for you.
#unknown I received my bachelor's degree from UNM, my master's from the University of Colorado.
#unknown Organic chemistry with a specialty in It's all right there.
#unknown "Xray crystallography.
#unknown " Really.
#unknown I could talk about that for hours.
#unknown I would love to.
#unknown Well, first, I'm curious about this.
#unknown That's a little pet project of mine.
#unknown Hm.
#unknown See, in my opinion, it's all about the quinic acid level.
#unknown You want just north of 4,800 milligrams per liter, but if you overboil to get there, you're going to leach your tannins.
#unknown Bitterness.
#unknown Yuck.
#unknown So I pull a mild vacuum.
#unknown That way, I can keep the temperature no higher than 92 C, and uh Let's see.
#unknown Judge for yourself.
#unknown [hisses] Oh, my God.
#unknown My God, that is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
#unknown [chuckles] Sumatran beans, and I also have to give credit to the grind, but, uh, thank you, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown Walt, please.
#unknown Call me Walt.
#unknown Huh, why the hell are we making meth? [chuckles] [pops] Tell me, with the phenylacetic acid solution, you said 150 drops per minute for the first 10 minutes, and then 90 for the remainder.
#unknown Why is that? Well, my thinking is, by tapering the phenyl, you get an oilier aqueous layer, and hence Better benzene extraction.
#unknown Exactly.
#unknown [chuckles] But actually I prefer ether.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown I'll have it for tomorrow.
#unknown Gale, I'm wondering how you Ended up here.
#unknown Well, actually, I'm still wondering how I ended up here, but, yes.
#unknown I mean, I can't imagine we strike each other as criminals.
#unknown Well, there's crime, and then there's crime, I suppose.
#unknown I'm definitely a libertarian.
#unknown Consenting adults want what they want, and if I'm not supplying it, they will get it somewhere else.
#unknown At least with me, they're getting exactly what they pay for.
#unknown No added toxins or adulterants.
#unknown Yeah, I was doing it the way you are supposed to, pursuing my doctorate at Colorado, NSF research grant.
#unknown I was on my way, jumping through hoops, kissing the proper behinds, attending to allhe nonchemistry that one finds oneself occupied with.
#unknown You know that world.
#unknown That is not what I signed on for.
#unknown I love the lab.
#unknown Because it's all still magic.
#unknown You know? Chemistry? I mean, on you lose that It is.
#unknown It is magic.
#unknown It still is.
#unknown [chuckles] And all the while I kept thinking about that great, old Whitman poem.
#unknown "When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer.
#unknown " Walt Whitman.
#unknown I I don't know it.
#unknown Uh, anyway Well, can you recite it? Pathetically enough I could.
#unknown All right, well No, no, come on.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Yeah? When I heard the learn'd astronomer; When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me; When I was shown the charts and the diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them; When I, sitting, heard the astronomer, where he lectured with much applause in the lectureroom, How soon, unaccountable, I became tired and sick; Till rising and gliding out, I wander'd off by myself, In the mystical moist nightair, and from time to time, Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.
#unknown Yes, I am a nerd.
#unknown Bravo.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown [Hank sighs] Come on, Pinkman.
#unknown You little rat bastard.
#unknown Get off your lazy ass and go bream the law.
#unknown [phone ringing] Hey, baby.
#unknown [Marie] Are you ever coming home? Marie, I'm working.
#unknown All right? Did you find it? The RV? Nope.
#unknown Working on it, so Why can't you just arrest him, make him tell you? [sighs] It's not that simple, baby.
#unknown There's a little thing called The Constitution.
#unknown The Constitution, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
#unknown This kid, I swear to God, I wish I just could [groans] This is that Pinkman character? That's the one.
#unknown Positive the little bastard has got an RV, and I just don't know where he keeps it.
#unknown Until he actually leads me to where or does something, I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.
#unknown Well, um not to bring up ancient history, but I for one can think of someone who might know something Possibly.
#unknown It's worth a shot.
#unknown Yeah? Who? [phone rings] Hello.
#unknown [Hank] Oh, hey, buddy.
#unknown Hey, how you doing? Oh, hey, Hank.
#unknown What's up? Listen, I hate to bother you.
#unknown I just I just, uh I just have a quick question.
#unknown Oh, shoot.
#unknown Now, I'm only asking you this because I'm at a, you know, deadend here potentially.
#unknown I'm working a case, and, uh [sighs] Listen, you gotta know that I would never put you on the spot or make you uncomfortable.
#unknown Hank, you could just cut to the chase.
#unknown Back when we lost you and I was trying to track you down through a former student of yours, Jesse Pinkman, now, you know that I know that once upon a time he may have dealt you a little weed.
#unknown Hank Just a little, and I so do not care about that.
#unknown As far as I'm concerned, you never inhaled, okay? Like you said, cut to the chase.
#unknown Do you remember if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV? You know, a recreational vehicle, you know, like a Winnebagotype deal, brown and beige? Uh, why? Well, it's a long story, but I'm personally of the opinion that he's moved on from weed and graduated to selling crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.
#unknown Walt? Yo.
#unknown What? Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown [groans] [phone beeps] [Saul] Hey, how's my favorite genius? Is this a secure line? [laughs] Is this a secure Yes, what's with the Hey, hello to you, too.
#unknown Listen, we've got a problem, a DEA problem.
#unknown Okay, I'm listening.
#unknown My brotherinlaw, he knows about the RV.
#unknown What RV? Our RV, the one which contains a meth lab, which is covered with my fingerprints.
#unknown Ring a bell? Okay, what exactly does "knows about" mean? Does he have it? Has he searched it? No, he knows it exists, and he's trying to find it.
#unknown He has linked it to Jesse, and it's only a matter of time before he tracks it down, so So get rid of it.
#unknown What are you doing sitting here talking to me for? Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
#unknown Right? You don't go near it.
#unknown No, no, listen, my brotherinlaw, he is surveying Jesse's house.
#unknown Do you understand? So he might've tapped the phones or bugged his house.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Plan A, then.
#unknown Go.
#unknown Get to it before the feds do.
#unknown And do what exactly? I mean, what The thing The thing is the size of a It's RV size.
#unknown I mean, where do I go to make an RV disappear? I'm not David Copperfield.
#unknown What do I look like, the RV disposal people? Did you not plan for this contingency? No.
#unknown Well, next time, plan for it, would you? The Starship Enterprise had a selfdestruct button.
#unknown I'm just saying.
#unknown Okay, oh, shut up.
#unknown I'm just saying, you know, you're good with tools and all.
#unknown Why don't you invent a waterpowered car, you know? If you did that, you would be rolling in it.
#unknown Socket wrench.
#unknown The big one.
#unknown What? You scared of the Arabs? [screeching] Are you out of your mind? Why is this out in the open? Who the hell are you? [Badger] He's He's Heisenberg.
#unknown Is this drivable? Does it run? Yeah, I was just changing the oil.
#unknown Well, finish it, quickly.
#unknown We'll wipe it clean and take it out to the desert.
#unknown Come here and help me.
#unknown Hold up.
#unknown What's this about? The DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration.
#unknown You've heard of them, haven't you? I know you have.
#unknown They know all about this RV, and they're trying to find it right now.
#unknown I want this off my property now.
#unknown No, no, no, no, no, we have got to destroy the evidence.
#unknown We've got to rig this thing to burn.
#unknown Do you understand? Not here you don't.
#unknown Just get it the hell out of here.
#unknown Now, listen to me.
#unknown I need your help, okay? If I go down, we all go down.
#unknown Do you understand? All right, just I know a better way.
#unknown I know a guy that'll wipe this off the planet, no questions asked.
#unknown Call him.
#unknown Hey, what about Jesse? [Walt] What about him? Hey, it's me.
#unknown Wanna hear something weird? [door slams] Now, listen to me.
#unknown You get that address.
#unknown Now, Badger, I don't care how! You find out where he's taking it! Oh, yeah.
#unknown Excuse me.
#unknown Are you leaving? Excuse me, gentlemen.
#unknown This booth is for paying customers.
#unknown Cynthia, it's okay.
#unknown I'll handle this.
#unknown [speaking Spanish] Beyond recovery, right? Now, beyond recovery means I get it.
#unknown Beyond recovery.
#unknown Obliterated, no evidence.
#unknown Hey, don't worry.
#unknown When we're through with it, it's going to be about yea big, okay? Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach, ship it across the Pacific.
#unknown Chinese turn it into patio furniture, so mind at ease.
#unknown Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm obviously going to need a ride.
#unknown Could you call a cab? You got it.
#unknown Pleasure doing business.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown I'll be right behind you.
#unknown I just need to God.
#unknown [sighs] [door opens] The hell you think you're doing? Me? No, this is mine just as much as yours! You don't get to just Oh, God.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown What? God, they're out [grunt] What? He's here.
#unknown Who's here? Holy Oh, no.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown You led him right to us.
#unknown [door rattles] [bangs] Shit.
#unknown [Hank] Mr.
#unknown Pinkman, you want to add resisting arrest? We'll add it.
#unknown No skin off my ass.
#unknown Last chance to do it the easy way.
#unknown [rattling] Got a warrant? [Hank] Who are you? Who are you? What do you know about this RV? Well, I'm the owner of this lot, which means you're trespassing on private property.
#unknown As far as the RV goes, seems to me it's locked, which means you're trying to break and enter, so I say again, you got a warrant? [chuckles] Well, I don't need one if I've got probable cause, counselor.
#unknown [Man] Probable cause usually relates to vehicles, is my understanding, you know, traffic stops and whatnot.
#unknown See these round rubber things? Wheels.
#unknown This is a vehicle.
#unknown This is a domicile, a residence, and thus protected by the Fourth Amendment from unlawful search and seizure.
#unknown Look buddy, why don't you just go out and Did you see this drive in here? How do you know it runs? Did you actually witness any wrongdoing? It seems to me you're just out here fishing.
#unknown Don't see that holding up in a court of law.
#unknown Oh, yeah? Well, look at these.
#unknown What do those look like to you? They sure look like bullet holes to me.
#unknown There was a firearm discharged inside of this "domicile.
#unknown " Willing to bet there's a judge or two out there who'd see that as probable cause, but I'll tell you what.
#unknown Why don't you call the Albuquerque police [whispering] How could you have known that they were there before you took off the tape? [whispers] What? How could you have known that they were there before you took off the tape? Say it.
#unknown Say it.
#unknown How could you have known that they were there before you took off the tape? That's right.
#unknown Probable cause needs to be readily apparent.
#unknown Huh.
#unknown There's somebody in there.
#unknown private domicile and I won't be harassed.
#unknown [Hank] Yeah, I'll tell you what, Pinkman.
#unknown Probable cause or no, I'll give you three seconds to get your ass out here.
#unknown This is my own private domicile, and I will not be harassed.
#unknown Bitch.
#unknown [Hank chuckles] Oh, yeah.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown You want your warrant? I'll have my guys bring it out here and deliver it to you on a little satin pillow.
#unknown How's that? I waited this long.
#unknown Wait a little longer.
#unknown Hey, Vicky.
#unknown Yeah, Schrader.
#unknown Give me Merkert, will you? [sighs] You know, I say I say we just ram him.
#unknown All right? I mean, we, uh we we start her up and just ram the shit out of his truck.
#unknown We make our escape.
#unknown Right? [sighs] Yeah, he'd, uh he'd shoot me in the head.
#unknown Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.
#unknown So what do we do, man, huh? What do we What? Please tell me you got something.
#unknown Yeah, I got something.
#unknown It's me.
#unknown We need your help.
#unknown [phone rings] Yeah.
#unknown [Woman] Is this Mr.
#unknown Henry R.
#unknown Schrader? Yeah.
#unknown Who's this? Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner with the Albuquerque Police.
#unknown Is your wife Marie Schrader? Yes, why? I'm sorry to inform you that your wife's been in an automobile accident.
#unknown She's being airlifted to Los Ranchos Medical Center and should be arriving there shortly.
#unknown How is she? What's her condition? I don't, um have the most current information, sir, but I think you might want to get there as soon as possible.
#unknown You're going to have to start paying me more.
#unknown [no audio except low hum] [phone ringing] [ringing] Marie? I'm just checking in.
#unknown I'd love to have some idea of whether I should cook dinner or not.
#unknown Are you okay? Yeah.
#unknown Why? Hank? What's up?  [speaking Spanish]
