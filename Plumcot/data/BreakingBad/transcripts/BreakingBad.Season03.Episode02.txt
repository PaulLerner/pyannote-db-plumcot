#unknown Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
#unknown Truck turn out to be a chicken run out of Juarez and Laredo.
#unknown Border Patrol's been playing hideandseek with these polleros for two years.

#unknown So, why did the Border Patrol kick this to us? They didn't.
#unknown I pulled it.
#unknown You ask me, ths highend cartel work.
#unknown Los Zetas, maybe.
#unknown Question is, why do we have Juarezstyle action on our side of the DMZ? They sending a message or clearing a path? Or was this about stopping one particular borderhopper? Maybe one of those extracrispies knew something he shouldn't.
#unknown Anyway, keep your eyes open.
#unknown All right.
#unknown That's it.

#unknown Good afternoon.
#unknown Nice to meet you.
#unknown Saul Goodman.
#unknown Nice to meet you.
#unknown You're not that lawyer on latenight television, are you? Better call Saul! [chuckles] [laughing] I get it all the time.
#unknown We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
#unknown I get it.
#unknown Flatfee clients.
#unknown Am I right? Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
#unknown I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
#unknown However, for our purposes, you might just as well visualize a large bag of money.
#unknown This individual wants to buy your use today, for cash.
#unknown Cash? Cash.
#unknown I know.
#unknown In this economy.
#unknown In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
#unknown You can ask Mr.
#unknown Gardiner.
#unknown I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
#unknown It the only reason we're sitting here.
#unknown Fair enough.
#unknown We, uh, get a few papers signed and notarized, we can take care of this right now.
#unknown In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon.
#unknown There's just one little hair in the soup uh, the price.
#unknown We feel 875 is very fair.
#unknown But I suppose there's always a little, uh, wiggle room.
#unknown Well, you wiggle us on down to 400, and you got yourselves a deal.
#unknown No, that's my offer.
#unknown That's less than half price.
#unknown We put almost that much into the renovations alone.
#unknown Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to? Well, this is a waste of time.
#unknown Ridiculous.
#unknown How could you possibly imagine that we would entertain this? Come on, hon.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown I just thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
#unknown The one that used to be in the basement.
#unknown I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown Oh, you got your termite inspection.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown But no meth lab.
#unknown Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
#unknown I, myself, am more openminded.
#unknown But it is tricky.
#unknown Don't get me wrong.
#unknown I applaud your c.
#unknown I mean, good try in sneaking a methcontaminated property past the buyer.
#unknown I mean, you know, could've been a good deal for you.
#unknown Too bad.
#unknown Now, I uld file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely, or I could start some criminal proceedings.
#unknown But I don't think any of us want that now, do we? How about it, counselor? Do you concur?  [hums] [grunts] Tada.
#unknown Here you go, son.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown It's not Devil's Island.
#unknown [grunts] Okay.
#unknown Ooh.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown [chuckles] Hello.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown Uh, mmm.

#unknown Well, I'm making dinner.
#unknown Oh, okay.
#unknown I'll just, uh, put it in the fridge.
#unknown It's even better the next day, huh? Hi, honey.
#unknown Uh Sorry.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Skyler Honey, what kind of example do we want to set here? Right? I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together? Just to hash things out like adults? You know We havediscussed everything we ne to discuss.
#unknown I thought I made myself very clear.
#unknown I got dipping sticks.
#unknown [yells, huffs] [groaning] [phone ringing] [groaning continues] [ringing continues] [Walt on machine] You've reached Walt's temporary number.
#unknown Please leave a message.
#unknown [spitting] [beeps] [Skyler on machine] When I went out this morning to get the newspaper, I saw a pizza on our roof.
#unknown Would you know anything about that? Listen to me, Walt.
#unknown You need to control yourself.
#unknown Calm down, accept the situation, and keep your distance.
#unknown If you can't manage that, I will get a restraining order.
#unknown [beeps] [yells] [groans] Skyler.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown I got your restraining order right here! Restrain this! Oh.
#unknown [groans] [groans] Oh, yeah.
#unknown [grunting] Breaking even's not so bad.
#unknown In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
#unknown Poor Jake.
#unknown He had his heart set on going to space camp.
#unknown [car approaching] [sighs] Oh, no.
#unknown Oh, G.
#unknown This is all we need.
#unknown [both sigh] Hey, Mom, Dad.
#unknown How's it going? Uh, Jesse, it's, uh, really not a good time.
