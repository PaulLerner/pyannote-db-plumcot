saul_goodman  Good afternoon.
saul_goodman  Nice to meet you.
saul_goodman  Saul Goodman.
adam_pinkman  Nice to meet you.
mrs._pinkman  You're not that lawyer on latenight television, are you?
saul_goodman  Better call Saul!
saul_goodman  I get it all the time.
mr._gardiner  We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
saul_goodman  I get it.
saul_goodman  Flatfee clients. Am I right?
saul_goodman  Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
saul_goodman  I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
saul_goodman  However, for our purposes, you might just as well visualize a large bag of money.
saul_goodman  This individual wants to buy your use today, for cash. Cash
mrs._pinkman  Cash.
saul_goodman  I
saul_goodman  I know. In this economy.
saul_goodman  In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
saul_goodman  You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
saul_goodman  I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
mr._gardiner  It the only reason we're sitting here.
saul_goodman  Fair enough.
saul_goodman  We, uh, get a few papers signed and notarized, we can take care of this right now.
saul_goodman  In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon.
saul_goodman  There's just one little hair in the soup uh
saul_goodman  price.
mr._gardiner  We feel 875 is very fair.
adam_pinkman  But I suppose there's always a little, uh, wiggle room. Well,
saul_goodman  you wiggle us on down to 400, and you got yourselves a deal.
mr._gardiner  No,
mr._gardiner  that's my offer.
saul_goodman  That's less
mrs._pinkman  less than half price.
mrs._pinkman  We put almost that much into the renovations alone. Why
mr._gardiner  Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to
saul_goodman  Well
mrs._pinkman  Well, this is a waste of time. Ridiculous
adam_pinkman  Ridiculous. How could you possibly
mr._gardiner  possibly imagine that we would entertain this?
adam_pinkman  Come on, hon.
saul_goodman  I don't know.
saul_goodman  I just thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
saul_goodman  one that used to be in the basement.
saul_goodman  I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
saul_goodman  No. No.
saul_goodman  Oh, you got your termite inspection.
saul_goodman  That's good.
saul_goodman  But no meth lab.
saul_goodman  Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
saul_goodman  I, myself, am more openminded.
saul_goodman  But it is tricky.
saul_goodman  Don't get me wrong.
saul_goodman  applaud your c. I
saul_goodman  I mean, good try in sneaking a methcontaminated property past the buyer.
saul_goodman  I mean, you know, could've been a good deal for you.
saul_goodman  Too bad.
saul_goodman  Now, I uld file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely,
saul_goodman  or I could start some criminal proceedings. But
saul_goodman  But I don't think any of us want that now, do we?
