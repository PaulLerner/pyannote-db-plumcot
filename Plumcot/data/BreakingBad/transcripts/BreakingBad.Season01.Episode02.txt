#unknown Are you okay?  You are a life saver.
#unknown Yeah, man.
#unknown We can't thank you enough.
#unknown Hey, mad props.
#unknown I could have sworn the guy said south.
#unknown But then, all of a sudden we're off the main road.
#unknown I'm trying to read the map while I'm driving, which is a bonehead maneuver.
#unknown And all of a sudden Bam, we're in that ditch.
#unknown Yeah, bam, I'm like, what the hell? You know? Yes, and my coffee mug.
#unknown Coffee? My mug of coffee? It spills all over my pants.
#unknown I mean, just a nightmare.
#unknown Dude, you so need GPS.
#unknown I mean, for real.
#unknown Like I said, we couldn't be more grateful.
#unknown Can't we just dump 'em here? What, then somebody finds them? Then what? People have seen us.
#unknown You're gonna flood it, man.
#unknown I'm not gonna flood it.
#unknown She's not gonna flood, all right? We're just gonna stay positive, right? We're going to clean up this mess.
#unknown Wish you would start.
#unknown Damn it.
#unknown See? You flooded it.
#unknown All right.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You know what? The RV is going to start now.
#unknown The RV is going to start right now.
#unknown It's gonna start and we're gonna drive it over to your house.
#unknown My house?  Yes.
#unknown We'll drive it over there and park it overnight.
#unknown And then tomorrow  No, man, not my house! Shut up! After we finish cleaning up this mess, we will go our separate ways.
#unknown Our paths will never cross.
#unknown And we will tell this to no one.
#unknown Understood? What, I can talk now? Fine.
#unknown That goes double for me.
#unknown Be good to me.
#unknown Oh, shit.
#unknown "The Cat's in the Bag" Yeah, absolutely.
#unknown You wanna hear something funny? We had a faculty meeting last Thursday and the topic was senior class photos, and how we had instituted a new rule last year that seniors are allowed to have photos taken by a photographer of their choice, Not necessarily the photographer that the school hires, right? So Anyway, some of the senior girls were going to that Glamour Shots place, to have their photos taken, and now they're bringing us all these photos, and Joan Epperman, you know Joan, suddenly has to go through all these photos and turn them down, because they show cleavage.
#unknown Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie? Yeah.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown You know, even these smallbusted girls have cleavage.
#unknown Apparently there's some new type of brassiere, or something.
#unknown The Wonderbra It's the Wonderbra.
#unknown Hey, there.
#unknown You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Junior.
#unknown We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message.
#unknown Hello, Mr.
#unknown White.
#unknown This is AT&amp;T calling.
#unknown Are you happy with your current long distance service? 'Cause if you're not, I would definitely, really love to talk to you as soon as possible about Hello? Hello.
#unknown This is Walter White speaking.
#unknown You said he was practically dead, okay? You said he would die any minute! Listen, I am having breakfast with my family right now, and I really don't appreciate these sales calls.
#unknown Well, too bad, man, 'cause guess what.
#unknown He's still not dead! I went and put my ear to the RV, I can hear him, like, rolling around in there, all right? I think he's awake, man, I think he's trying to get loose.
#unknown Where the hell are you? I'm freaking out over here!  Calm down, damn it.
#unknown Are you gonna help me clean this up?  We got loose ends here!  Calm down! I will be there after school.
#unknown After school? Are you shitting me? Ditch it, man, call in sick.
#unknown Listen, that is just not going to work for me.
#unknown I'm not interested in that at all.
#unknown And I would appreciate if you don't call here anymore.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown They're so annoying, those people.
#unknown You have a good day, sweetie.
#unknown Okay, Mom.
#unknown You too.
#unknown Bye, honey.
#unknown Drive safe.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Yo, yo, yo, 1483369, representing the ABQ.
#unknown What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.
#unknown So, the term "chiral" derives from the Greek word "hand.
#unknown " The concept here being that, just as your left hand, and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right? Identical, and yet opposite.
#unknown Well, so too organic compounds can exist as mirror image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level.
#unknown But although they may look the same, they don't always behave the same.
#unknown For instance I'm sorry For instance Thalidomide.
#unknown The righthanded isomer of the drug Thalidomide is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness but, make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the lefthanded isomer of the drug Thalidomide, and her child will be born with horrible birth defects.
#unknown Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s.
#unknown So, chiral, chirality, mirrored images, right? Active, inactive.
#unknown Good, bad.
#unknown Yes, Ben? Is this gonna be on the murder? What? Is this gonna be on the midterm? The chirality on the midterm? No, no, well, maybe, maybe, yes, you know, but prepare for it to be on the midterm.
#unknown Can't hurt to know it, right? Knowledge is power! Oh, no, no Not good.
#unknown Not good.
#unknown What the Hey, you.
#unknown Listen No, no, no, no! Oh, God! MILF's? What the hell is a MILF? Now what? The other one, out in the RV, he's  You're sure?  Yes.
#unknown Positive?  Feel free to go check it yourself.
#unknown Yes, good idea.
#unknown Maybe I should do that before he, too, wanders off on the damn street!  Okay, you know what, I  All right, all right! The one downstairs, tell me about him.
#unknown Come on, anything, something!  Start with his name, at least!  Krazy8.
#unknown Krazy8? What the hell does that even mean? I don't know, man, okay? I mean, he's like, Krazy8, okay? I don't know.
#unknown So, you work with him regularly? No, not him so much.
#unknown His cousin, mainly.
#unknown Who's his cousin?  The guy out in the RV!  All right, all right.
#unknown Krazy8's one level higher.
#unknown One level higher? Yeah, you know, not like street level.
#unknown Higher.
#unknown You know, there's like a Starbucks at every corner? Krazy8 is, like, the dude that sells Starbucks his beans.
#unknown Okay, so he's a distributor.
#unknown Okay, so, is he I mean, is he In other words What is his reputation for violence? Well, um He did try to kill us both yesterday, so there's that.
#unknown What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right? He's a He's a businessman, he's a man of business.
#unknown It would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual selfinterest, yes? What? Do you think he is capable of listening to reason? What kind of reason? Like "Dear Krazy8, listen, "if I let you go, will you promise not to come back and waste my family? "No Colombian neckties.
#unknown " You mean that kind of reason? No, man, I can't say as I have high hopes where that's concerned.
#unknown What was that? What was what? Come see! We gotta tie him up.
#unknown Why the hell didn't we tie him up? Because he was out cold.
#unknown But what if he's faking it? Like if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo! And then, when the coast is clear, I'd be up looking for weapons and shit, waiting to pounce! Now if it was me, and I couldn't find a decent enough weapon, I would just lie back down, and bide my time.
#unknown So now what do we do? You keep asking me that like you think I have some answer.
#unknown Well, you gotta do something!  We! We have got to do something, and I am opened to suggestions.
#unknown Man, uhuh, okay, this whole thing was your deal! Don't you dare put that on me! You brought those guys out there, this is your responsability! Like I came to you, begging to cook meth.
#unknown "Nerdiest old dude I know, you wanna come cook crystal?" Please! "I'd ask my diaperwearing granny, but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV.
#unknown " What about the the phosphate gas? Phosphine gas.
#unknown What about it? I mean, do you think it still might kill him? You know, with like a delayed reaction or something? I don't know.
#unknown You're supposed to be a scientist!  Look! This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention.
#unknown We have got a body in that RV, and it's getting warmer outside, understand? And we have got to do something about that soon.
#unknown And in a way that no one will ever find it.
#unknown Now that last part is very, very important.
#unknown Therefore, it seems to me that our best course of action would be chemical disincorporation.
#unknown Dissolving in strong acid.
#unknown Oh man, that's messed up.
#unknown You're not You're not serious? You're serious? Who's gonna do that? And don't look at me! I guess we'll both do it together.
#unknown No, Mr.
#unknown White, okay, I'm not good with dead bodies.
#unknown We're in this 50/50, okay? I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of us deals with the body situation, while the other one of us deals with the Krazy8 situation.
#unknown In a scenario like this, I don't suppose it is bad form to just flip a coin.
#unknown Heads or tails?  I'll do the body in the acid, okay? Heads or tails? Heads.
#unknown Best two out of three? Yo, yo, yo, 1483369, representing the ABQ.
#unknown What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown White, it's me, pick up.
#unknown I got a container question.
#unknown Hello? Mr.
#unknown White, pick up the phone, man! Yes? What kind of plastic, man? Polyethylene.
#unknown How the hell am I supposed to know that? Because I told you.
#unknown Look, just look at the bottom for a triangle stamped "LDPE.
#unknown " It should be molded right into the plastic.
#unknown Yeah, yeah, LDPE.
#unknown Right on, got it.
#unknown But I don't know, man, this feels kind of flimsy.
#unknown Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this.
#unknown Not hydrofluoric.
#unknown Why not? Look, you skipped, clowned around or otherwise jerked off to every lecture I ever gave.
#unknown As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over.
#unknown Oh, okay.
#unknown Be a dick about it.
#unknown So, hey, have you Have you done the thing? Yeah, I'm working up to it.
#unknown You know what? I bet he doesn't even wake up.
#unknown Not even if you took him to the hospital right now.
#unknown Now, if it was me, I would just try and think of it like I was I was doing him a favor.
#unknown Who's there? Don't you fucking play games with me.
#unknown Who's there? Yeah, I see you.
#unknown What are you gonna do? I need water! Bring me some water, would you? Please? You don't like the crust? Where's my cousin Emilio? He dead? Hey, Mr.
#unknown White! Mr.
#unknown White? Are you smoking weed? Oh, my God! Wait a minute.
#unknown Is that my weed? What the hell, man? Make yourself at home, why don't you? So what did you end up buying? Nothing.
#unknown No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.
#unknown I don't suppose you could buy two bins Legs in one, torso in the other? God.
#unknown I don't suppose you could kiss my ass? How did it go? So you didn't do it? Not yet.
#unknown God.
#unknown I gotta go.
#unknown What? No, come back here! Sorry.
#unknown I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
#unknown Tomorrow? I've got a doctor's appointement, I gotta go.
#unknown Look, stay away from him.
#unknown He's awake.
#unknown Hey, man, we flipped a coin.
#unknown We flipped a coin! We're good? We're very good.
#unknown We're excellent, I'd say.
#unknown Oh, would you look at that face! Smile, peanut! So, who's up for knowing? Girl.
#unknown Girl?  You sure?  Pretty sure.
#unknown Can I tell you this is exactly what I was hoping? You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.
#unknown Looking fabulous.
#unknown Let me see if they're done with the blood sugar, then we'll get you out.
#unknown I'll be right back.
#unknown Who is Jesse Pinkman? Jesse Jesse Pinkman.
#unknown He called just this morning, Walt, please don't deny it.
#unknown It says on his MyShout page he attended Wynne.
#unknown Was he one of your students? Yeah.
#unknown He was nobody.
#unknown Who is he to you? Why is he calling? What is this big secret you seem to be discussing with some druggie burnout? You don't come home last night until 2 in the morning, you don't tell me where you've been.
#unknown You spent the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.
#unknown Tell me what's going on with you.
#unknown Don't you think you owe me that? Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you? He sells me pot.
#unknown He sells you pot? Marijuana, yeah.
#unknown Not a lot.
#unknown I mean, I don't know.
#unknown I kinda like it.
#unknown Are you out of your mind? What are you, like 16 years old? Your brotherinlaw is a DEA agent.
#unknown What is wrong with you? Skyler I just haven't quite been myself lately.
#unknown Yeah, no shit.
#unknown Thanks for noticing.
#unknown I haven't been myself lately, but I love you.
#unknown Nothing about that has changed.
#unknown Nothing ever will.
#unknown So right now, what I need is for you to climb down out of my ass.
#unknown Can you do that? Will you do that for me, honey? Will you, please, just once, get off my ass? You know, I'd appreciate it.
#unknown I really would.
#unknown Stop! Stop in 15 minutes.
#unknown Just meat, is all.
#unknown Just a bunch of meat.
#unknown Oh, Jesus.
#unknown It's cool, you're cool.
#unknown You're all good, yo.
#unknown You're all good in the hood.
#unknown It's fine.
#unknown Just a bunch of meat, come on.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Excuse me! Excuse me? You.
#unknown Yes, you.
#unknown May I talk to you? This is private property! Just a minute.
#unknown I wanna talk to you.
#unknown No, I'm not interested.
#unknown Hey, don't touch me! Do not touch me.
#unknown All right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here.
#unknown Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.
#unknown Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
#unknown My husband is Walter White, yo.
#unknown He told me everything.
#unknown Seriously?  That's right.
#unknown And just so you know My brotherinlaw is a DEA agent.
#unknown And I will not hesitate to call him.
#unknown Not if I have to.
#unknown Understood? This is your one and only warning.
#unknown Do not sell marijuana to my husband.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown Don't call our house again.
#unknown You stay away from him, or you'll be one sorry individual.
#unknown You got me? I think so, yeah.
#unknown No more marijuana.
#unknown I can dig it.
#unknown You can dig it.
#unknown Wonderful.
#unknown Not that it's any of my business, but you might wanna consider a different line of work.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown "Let's go to your house, yo! "Makes perfect sense.
#unknown Let's "Let's completely screw up your house "so you never wanna spend another night in it.
#unknown " "Sure.
#unknown You know, why not?" "And then, how's about I send over my psychobitch wife to "you know, break your balls and threaten you? "God, that'd be hilarious.
#unknown " "And then, the killer in the basement? "The one who's completely my responsabilty.
#unknown "Hell, let's just let him live down there.
#unknown "Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like "three times a day.
#unknown " "Sure, why not? "That would be amazing.
#unknown "Thank you so much for the opportunity.
#unknown "I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies.
#unknown " You got a brother in the goddamned DEA? What? You said you were just doing some ridealong.
#unknown Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA? Brotherinlaw.
#unknown Now there's a load off my mind.
#unknown Where did you hear that? Your freaking wife told me when she was here all up on my shit.
#unknown Yeah, that's right.
#unknown She almost caught me moving Emilio! Good job in wearing the pants in the family.
#unknown And why did you go and tell her I was selling you weed? Because somehow, it seemed preferable to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.
#unknown Is that what I think it is? Yeah, it is.
#unknown I smoked a bowl, so what? My house, my rules.
#unknown Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay? I held up my end.
#unknown I already took care of Emilio.
#unknown You're still diddling around, trying to get your nut up.
#unknown Well, boohoo.
#unknown I have the truly awful job here.
#unknown You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there? Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs.
#unknown I barely got him in the bathtub! Bathtub? What  What do you mean, "bathtub"?  That's another thing, Why you got me running around town, trying to find some stupid piece of plastic, when I have a perfectly good tub I can use? Oh, God.
#unknown I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes.
#unknown That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy.
#unknown You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic.
#unknown It will however dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic.
#unknown So there's that.
