skyler_white  Are you okay
walter_white  You are a life saver.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, man.
walter_white  We can't thank you
jesse_pinkman  you enough. Hey, mad props. I
walter_white  I could have sworn the guy said south.
walter_white  But then, all of a sudden we're off the main road.
walter_white  I'm trying to read the map while I'm driving, which is a bonehead maneuver.
walter_white  And all of a sudden Bam, we're in that ditch.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, bam, I'm
Jesse_Pinkman  I'm like, what the hell?
jesse_pinkman  You know?
walter_white  Yes
walter_white  Yes, and my coffee mug.
walter_white  Coffee?
walter_white  My mug of coffee?
walter_white  It spills all over my pants. I mean, just a nightmare.
jesse_pinkman  Dude, you so need GPS. I mean, for real.
walter_white  I said, we couldn't be more
jesse_pinkman  grateful. Can't we just dump 'em here?
walter_white  What, then somebody finds them?
walter_white  Then what?
walter_white  People have seen us.
jesse_pinkman  You're gonna flood it, man. I'm
walter_white  I'm not gonna flood it.
walter_white  She's not gonna flood, all right?
walter_white  We're just gonna stay positive, right?
walter_white  to clean up this mess.
walter_white  Wish you
jesse_pinkman  Damn it.
jesse_pinkman  See? You flooded it.
walter_white  All
walter_white  All right.
walter_white  You know what?
walter_white  The RV is going to start now.
walter_white  The RV is going to start right now.
walter_white  It's gonna start and
walter_white  we're gonna drive it over to your house. My
jesse_pinkman  My house? Yes
walter_white  Yes. We'll
walter_white  We'll drive it over there and park it overnight.
walter_white  And then tomorrow No
jesse_pinkman  man, not my house
walter_white  house!
walter_white  After we finish cleaning up this mess, we will go our separate ways.
walter_white  Our paths will never cross.
walter_white  And we will tell this to no one.
walter_white  Understood?
jesse_pinkman  What, I can talk now?
jesse_pinkman  Fine.
jesse_pinkman  That goes double for me.
walter_white  Be good to
walter_white  Cat's in
walter_white  Yeah, absolutely.
walter_white  You wanna hear something funny?
walter_white  We had a faculty meeting last Thursday and the topic was senior class photos, and how we had instituted a new rule last year that seniors are allowed to have photos taken by a photographer of their choice,
walter_white  Not necessarily the photographer that the school hires,
walter_white  So Anyway, some of the senior girls were going to that Glamour Shots place, to have their photos taken,
walter_white  and now they're bringing us all these photos, and Joan Epperman, you know Joan,
walter_white  suddenly has to go through all these photos and turn them down, because they show cleavage.
skyler_white  you get enough pancakes, sweetie?
walter_white_jr.  Yeah.
walter_white_jr.  I'm good.
skyler_white  You
walter_white  You know, even these smallbusted girls have cleavage.
walter_white  Apparently there's some new type of brassiere, or something.
walter_white_jr.  The Wonderbra
walter_white_jr.  It's the Wonderbra.
skyler_white  Hey, there.
skyler_white  You've reached Walt, Skyler and Walter, Junior.
skyler_white  We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave us a message.
jesse_pinkman  Mr. White.
jesse_pinkman  This is AT&T calling.
jesse_pinkman  Are you happy with your current
jesse_pinkman  long distance service? 'Cause if you're not, I would definitely,
walter_white  really love to talk to you as soon as possible about Hello? Hello. This is Walter White speaking.
jesse_pinkman  You said he was practically dead, okay?
jesse_pinkman  You said he would die any minute! Listen
walter_white  Listen, I am having breakfast with my family right now, and I really don't appreciate these sales calls.
jesse_pinkman  Well, too bad, man, 'cause guess what.
jesse_pinkman  He's still not dead!
jesse_pinkman  I went and put my ear to the RV,
jesse_pinkman  I can hear him, like, rolling around in there, all right?
jesse_pinkman  I think he's awake, man,
jesse_pinkman  I think he's trying to get loose. Where
jesse_pinkman  hell are you? I'm
jesse_pinkman  freaking out over here! Calm
walter_white  Calm down, damn it. Are
jesse_pinkman  Are you gonna help me clean this
jesse_pinkman  We got loose ends here!
walter_white  Calm down!
walter_white  I will be there after school. After school?
jesse_pinkman  Are you shitting
jesse_pinkman  shitting me?
jesse_pinkman  Ditch it, man, call
jesse_pinkman  call in sick.
walter_white  Listen, that is just not going to work for me.
walter_white  I'm not interested in that at all. And
walter_white  And I would appreciate if you don't call here anymore.
walter_white  They're
walter_white  They're so annoying, those people.
skyler_white  You have a good day, sweetie.
walter_white_jr.  Mom. You
walter_white_jr.  You too.
walter_white  Drive
jesse_pinkman  Yo, yo, yo, 1483369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone.
walter_white  So, the term" chiral" derives from the Greek word" hand.
walter_white  The concept here being that, just as your left hand, and your right hand are mirror images of one another, right? Identical, and yet opposite. Well, so too organic compounds can exist as mirror image forms of one another all the way down at the molecular level.
walter_white  But although they may look the same, they don't always behave the same.
walter_white  For instance
walter_white  I'm sorry For
walter_white  For instance
walter_white  Thalidomide.
walter_white  The righthanded isomer of the drug Thalidomide is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman to prevent morning sickness but
walter_white  but, make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman the lefthanded isomer of the drug Thalidomide, and her child will be born with horrible birth defects.
walter_white  Which is precisely what happened in the 1950s.
walter_white  So, chiral, chirality, mirrored images, right?
walter_white  Active, inactive. Good,
walter_white  Yes, Ben?
ben  Is this gonna be on the murder?
walter_white  Is
ben  Is this gonna be on the midterm?
walter_white  chirality on the midterm?
walter_white  No,
walter_white  well, maybe,
walter_white  maybe,
walter_white  you know, but
walter_white  but prepare for it to be on the midterm.
walter_white  Can't hurt to know it, right?
walter_white  Knowledge is power!
jesse_pinkman  Oh,
walter_white  no, no Not good.
skyler_white  What the hell
jesse_pinkman  Now what?
walter_white  The other one, out in the RV,
walter_white  You're sure?
jesse_pinkman  Yes.
walter_white  Positive?
jesse_pinkman  Feel free
jesse_pinkman  free to go check it yourself. Yes
walter_white  Yes, good idea.
walter_white  Maybe I should do that before he, too, wanders off on the damn street!
jesse_pinkman  Okay, you know what, I
jesse_pinkman  I All right,
walter_white  all right!
walter_white  The
jesse_pinkman  The one downstairs, tell me about him.
walter_white  Come on,
walter_white  anything,
walter_white  something!
walter_white  Start with his name, at least!
jesse_pinkman  Krazy8.
walter_white  Krazy8?
walter_white  What the hell does that even mean?
jesse_pinkman  I don't know, man, okay?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, he's like, Krazy8, okay?
jesse_pinkman  I don't know.
walter_white  So, you work with him regularly?
jesse_pinkman  No, not him so much.
jesse_pinkman  His cousin, mainly.
walter_white  Who's his cousin?
jesse_pinkman  The guy out in the RV
walter_white  RV! All right,
jesse_pinkman  right. Krazy8's one level higher.
walter_white  One level higher?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, you know,
jesse_pinkman  not like street level
jesse_pinkman  Higher.
jesse_pinkman  You know, there's like a Starbucks at every corner?
jesse_pinkman  Krazy8 is, like, the dude that sells Starbucks his beans.
walter_white  Okay, so he's a distributor.
walter_white  Okay, so, is he I mean, is he
walter_white  he In
walter_white  In other words What is his reputation for violence?
jesse_pinkman  Well, um He did try to kill us both yesterday, so there's that.
walter_white  What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right?
walter_white  He's a He's a businessman,
walter_white  he's a man of business.
walter_white  It would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting out of mutual selfinterest, yes?
walter_white  Do you think he is capable of listening to reason?
jesse_pinkman  What kind of reason?
jesse_pinkman  Like" Dear Krazy8, listen," if I let you go, will you promise not to come back and waste my family?
jesse_pinkman  No Colombian neckties.
jesse_pinkman  You mean that kind of reason?
jesse_pinkman  No, man, I can't say as I have high hopes where that's concerned.
walter_white  what?
jesse_pinkman  gotta tie him
walter_white  Why
walter_white  Why the hell
jesse_pinkman  hell didn't we tie him up
jesse_pinkman  Because
jesse_pinkman  But what if he's faking it? Like if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo! And then, when the coast is clear, I'd be up looking for weapons and shit, waiting to pounce! Now if it was me, and I couldn't find a decent enough weapon
jesse_pinkman  now what do we do?
walter_white  You keep asking me that like you think I have some answer.
jesse_pinkman  Well, you gotta do something
walter_white  something!
walter_white  We have got to do something, and I am opened to suggestions.
jesse_pinkman  Man, uhuh, okay, this whole thing was your deal
walter_white  deal! Don't you dare put that on me!
walter_white  You brought those guys out there,
walter_white  this is your responsability!
jesse_pinkman  Like I came to you, begging to cook meth.
jesse_pinkman " Nerdiest old dude I know, you wanna come cook crystal?"
jesse_pinkman  Please!
jesse_pinkman  I'd ask my diaperwearing granny, but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the RV.
jesse_pinkman  What about the the phosphate gas?
walter_white  Phosphine gas.
walter_white  What about it?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, do you think it still might kill him?
jesse_pinkman  You know, with like a delayed reaction or something?
walter_white  I don't know.
jesse_pinkman  You're supposed to be a scientist!
walter_white  This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention.
walter_white  We have got a body in that RV,
walter_white  and it's getting warmer outside,
walter_white  understand?
walter_white  And we have got to do something about that soon.
walter_white  And in a way that no one will ever find it.
walter_white  Now that last part is very, very important.
walter_white  Therefore, it seems to me that our best course of action would be chemical disincorporation.
walter_white  Dissolving in strong acid.
jesse_pinkman  Oh man, that's messed
jesse_pinkman  You're not You're not serious?
jesse_pinkman  You're serious?
jesse_pinkman  Who's gonna do that?
jesse_pinkman  And don't look at me!
walter_white  I guess we'll both do it together.
jesse_pinkman  No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not good with dead bodies.
walter_white  We're in this 50/50,
walter_white  I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of us deals with the body situation, while the other one of us deals with the Krazy8 situation.
walter_white  a scenario like this, I don't suppose it is bad form to just flip a coin.
walter_white  Heads or tails?
jesse_pinkman  I'll do the body in the acid, okay?
walter_white  Heads or tails?
jesse_pinkman  Heads.
walter_white  Best two out of three? Yo,
jesse_pinkman  yo, yo, 1483369, representing the ABQ. What up, biatch? Leave it at the tone. Mr.
jesse_pinkman  White
jesse_pinkman  White, it's me,
jesse_pinkman  pick up.
jesse_pinkman  I got a container
jesse_pinkman  Hello? Mr. White,
jesse_pinkman  pick up the phone, man! Yes?
jesse_pinkman  What kind of plastic, man?
walter_white  Polyethylene.
jesse_pinkman  How the hell am I supposed to know that?
walter_white  Because I told you.
walter_white  Look, just look at the bottom for a triangle stamped" LDPE."
walter_white  It should be molded right into the plastic.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, yeah, LDPE. Right
jesse_pinkman  Right on, got it
jesse_pinkman  know, man,
jesse_pinkman  this feels kind of flimsy.
jesse_pinkman  Any decent acid's gonna eat right through this.
walter_white  Not hydrofluoric.
jesse_pinkman  Why not?
walter_white  Look, you skipped, clowned around or otherwise jerked off to every lecture I ever gave.
walter_white  As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over.
jesse_pinkman  Oh, okay. Be a dick about it.
jesse_pinkman  So, hey, have you Have you done the thing?
walter_white  Yeah, I'm working up to it.
jesse_pinkman  what?
jesse_pinkman  I bet he doesn't even wake up.
jesse_pinkman  Not even if you took him to the hospital right now
jesse_pinkman  was me, I would just try and think of it like I was I was doing him a favor.
domingo_molina  with me. Who's there? Yeah, I see you. What are
domingo_molina  you gonna do? I need
domingo_molina  water!
domingo_molina  me some water, would you?
domingo_molina  Please?
walter_white  don't like the crust?
domingo_molina  Where's my cousin Emilio?
domingo_molina  He dead?
jesse_pinkman  Hey, Mr.
jesse_pinkman  White! Mr. White?
jesse_pinkman  Are you smoking weed?
jesse_pinkman  Oh, my God! Wait
jesse_pinkman  a minute. Is that my weed?
jesse_pinkman  What the hell, man?
jesse_pinkman  Make yourself at home, why don't you
walter_white  So what did you end up buying?
jesse_pinkman  Nothing.
jesse_pinkman  No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.
walter_white  suppose you could buy two bins
walter_white  bins Legs
walter_white  Legs in one, torso in the other?
jesse_pinkman  God.
jesse_pinkman  I don't suppose you could kiss my ass?
jesse_pinkman  So you didn't
jesse_pinkman  it?
walter_white  Not yet.
jesse_pinkman  God. I gotta
jesse_pinkman  gotta go
jesse_pinkman  go. What? No, come
jesse_pinkman  come back here!
walter_white  Sorry.
walter_white  I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
jesse_pinkman  Tomorrow?
walter_white  got a doctor's appointement,
walter_white  I gotta go.
walter_white  Look, stay away from him
walter_white  He's awake.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, man, we flipped a coin.
jesse_pinkman  We flipped a coin!
skyler_white  We're good?
ob-gyn  We're very good.
ob-gyn  We're excellent, I'd say.
ob-gyn  Oh, would you look at that face!
ob-gyn  Smile, peanut!
ob-gyn  So, who's up for knowing?
skyler_white  Girl?
skyler_white  You sure?
ob-gyn  Pretty sure.
walter_white  Can I
walter_white  I tell you this is exactly what I
skyler_white  was hoping
skyler_white  You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.
ob-gyn  Looking fabulous.
ob-gyn  Let me see if they're done with the blood sugar, then we'll get you out. I'll be right back
skyler_white  Who is Jesse Pinkman?
skyler_white  Jesse Pinkman.
skyler_white  He called just this morning,
skyler_white  Walt, please don't deny it.
walter_white  It
skyler_white  It says on his MyShout page he attended Wynne.
skyler_white  Was he one of your students?
walter_white  Yeah
walter_white  Yeah. He was nobody.
skyler_white  Who is he to you?
skyler_white  Why is he calling?
skyler_white  What is this big secret you seem to be discussing with some druggie burnout?
skyler_white  You don't come home last night until 2 in the morning, you
skyler_white  you don't tell me where you've been.
skyler_white  You spent the entire night in the bathroom, Walt.
skyler_white  Tell me what's going on with you.
skyler_white  you think you owe me that?
skyler_white  Who's this Jesse Pinkman to you?
walter_white  He sells me pot. He sells you pot?
skyler_white  Not

walter_white  like it
skyler_white  Are you out of your mind?
skyler_white  What are you, like 16 years old?
skyler_white  Your brotherinlaw is a DEA agent.
skyler_white  What is wrong with you?
walter_white  Skyler I just haven't quite been myself lately.
skyler_white  no shit.
skyler_white  Thanks for noticing. I
walter_white  I haven't been myself lately, but I love you.
walter_white  Nothing about that has changed.
walter_white  Nothing ever will.
walter_white  So right now, what I need is for you to climb down out of my ass.
walter_white  Can you do that?
walter_white  you do that for me, honey?
walter_white  Will you, please, just once, get off my ass? You
walter_white  I'd appreciate it
walter_white  I really would.
walter_white  Stop in 15 minutes.
jesse_pinkman  Just meat, is all. Just a bunch of meat.
jesse_pinkman  Oh, Jesus.
jesse_pinkman  It's cool, you're cool.
jesse_pinkman  You're all good, yo. You're all good in the hood. It's
jesse_pinkman  a bunch of meat, come on. You got it.
skyler_white  Excuse me!
skyler_white  Excuse me?
skyler_white  You.
skyler_white  Yes, you.
skyler_white  May I talk to you?
jesse_pinkman  This is private property! Just
skyler_white  Just a minute.
skyler_white  I wanna talk to you.
jesse_pinkman  No, I'm not interested.
jesse_pinkman  Hey,
skyler_white  don't touch me!
skyler_white  Do not touch me.
jesse_pinkman  All right,
jesse_pinkman  look, not touching,
jesse_pinkman  okay? Not touching here.
jesse_pinkman  Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.
skyler_white  Well, my name is Skyler White,
skyler_white  My husband is Walter
skyler_white  me everything.
jesse_pinkman  That's right
skyler_white  And
skyler_white  so you know My brotherinlaw is a DEA agent. And I will not hesitate to call him.
skyler_white  Not if
skyler_white  This is your one and only
skyler_white  Do not sell marijuana to my husband.
skyler_white  our house again
skyler_white  You stay away from him, or you'll be
skyler_white  got me
jesse_pinkman  think so, yeah.
jesse_pinkman  No more marijuana.
jesse_pinkman  it. You can dig it.
skyler_white  Not
jesse_pinkman  that it's any of my business, but you might wanna consider a different line of work. Okay."
jesse_pinkman  Let's go to your house, yo!
jesse_pinkman  Let's" Let's completely screw up your house" so you never wanna spend another night in it.
jesse_pinkman " Sure.
jesse_pinkman  You know,
jesse_pinkman  then, how's about I send over my psychobitch wife to" you know, break your balls and threaten you?
jesse_pinkman " God, that'd be hilarious."
jesse_pinkman  And then, the killer in the basement?" The one who's completely my responsabilty." Hell, let's just let him live down there.
jesse_pinkman  Just, I don't know, make sure to feed him, like" three times a day.
jesse_pinkman " Sure
jesse_pinkman  Sure, why not?" That would be amazing.
jesse_pinkman  Thank you so much for the opportunity.
jesse_pinkman  I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies.
jesse_pinkman  You got a brother in the goddamned DEA?
jesse_pinkman  You said you were just doing some ridealong.
jesse_pinkman  Yes or no, do you have a brother in the DEA?
walter_white  Now
jesse_pinkman  Now there's a load off my mind.
walter_white  Where did you hear that
jesse_pinkman  Your freaking wife told me when she was here all up on my shit.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, that's right.
jesse_pinkman  She almost caught me moving Emilio!
jesse_pinkman  Good job in wearing the pants in the family.
jesse_pinkman  And why did you go and tell her I was selling you weed?
walter_white  Because somehow, it seemed preferable to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.
walter_white  Is that what I think it is?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, it is.
jesse_pinkman  I smoked a bowl,
jesse_pinkman  so what?
jesse_pinkman  My house, my rules.
jesse_pinkman  Hey, no, no! Don't
jesse_pinkman  Don't give me that, okay?
jesse_pinkman  I held up my end.
jesse_pinkman  I already took care of Emilio.
jesse_pinkman  You're still diddling around, trying to get your nut up
walter_white  up. Well, boohoo.
walter_white  I have the truly awful job here.
jesse_pinkman  You wanna talk awful? You
jesse_pinkman  You wanna go there?
jesse_pinkman  Try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs.
jesse_pinkman  I barely got him in the bathtub! Bathtub?
walter_white  What
walter_white  What do you mean," bathtub"
jesse_pinkman ? That's another thing,
jesse_pinkman  Why you got me running around town, trying to find some stupid piece of plastic, when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?
walter_white  I'm sorry, what were you asking me?
walter_white  Oh, yes.
walter_white  That stupid plastic container I asked you to buy.
walter_white  You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic.
walter_white  It will however dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic.
walter_white  So there's that.
