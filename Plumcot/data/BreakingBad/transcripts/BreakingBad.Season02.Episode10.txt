#unknown Wait, no.
#unknown I actually I changed it to Rewindo.
#unknown Anyways, he goes backwards.
#unknown He can make everything go in reverse.
#unknown Time and stuff? Like time travelling? No, he just walks backwards.
#unknown He walks backwards? Is that a superpower? What good is that? No, I mean, he does it, like, really fast.
#unknown Okay, look, say someone's coming at him with a knife, right? I mean, it's helpful.
#unknown Then he can just zip backwards away from them.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Yo, I was a kid when I drew all these.
#unknown It was like four years ago.
#unknown They all look like you.
#unknown What? It's you in all of these.
#unknown No.

#unknown No, no, no, that was not your fault.
#unknown Not at all.
#unknown See, your.

#unknown You and Uncle Hank, you seemed pissed off.
#unknown No.
#unknown No.
#unknown We're fine.
#unknown Everything's fine.
#unknown I called him this morning and made my apologies.
#unknown But, son, I owe you an apology most of all.
#unknown I should have used better judgement all around.
#unknown Having you drink in the first place, it was not right and for that I'm very sorry.
#unknown But I kept up, right? You and Uncle Hank.
#unknown I drank three.
#unknown I have some tools to put away.

#unknown A favour? Yeah, I told you.
#unknown He's a hardass.
#unknown He seemed cool to me.
#unknown Yeah, well.
#unknown So, what's the deal? There's no deal.
#unknown I was helping you out, okay? Protecting you.
#unknown How's that? I mean I'm letting you smoke in here and everything.
#unknown I bought a filter.
#unknown And I figured the less he knows, the better.
#unknown You acted like you didn't even know me.
#unknown So? So? You think I'm gonna be all like: "Dad, meet the stoner guy who lives next door.
#unknown And by the way, I'm sleeping with him"? That's all you think you're doing? Why do you even care about my dad? I don't.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Then I don't know why we're talking about it.
#unknown Us.
#unknown All right? I'm talking about us.
#unknown Us.

#unknown Rot? Yeah.
#unknown Here.
#unknown I'll show you.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Take a look at that.
#unknown See that? Yeah.
#unknown Ever seen anything like it? It's wood.
#unknown It's wood that contains fruiting bodies.
#unknown Fruity what? Fungus.
#unknown And it is on a rampage.
#unknown I don't really see anything.
#unknown Yeah, well, it's there.
#unknown You just have to know where to look.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Then you cut it all out.
#unknown You just cut it out and start fresh.
#unknown Well, better get to it.
#unknown Is the whole house gonna collapse or something? Not if I can help it.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown You bucking for a promotion? Go home already.
#unknown I will.
#unknown I will.
#unknown Hey, can I just ask the Keller account? The Keller account? It's listed as a current asset on this balance sheet but the invoice was never presented to accounts receivable, so.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown One of these days I'm gonna just sort through all the Dad stuff.
#unknown He had so many "Don't worry about it, pay me Friday" relationships with these little companies.
#unknown We'll figure it out tomorrow.
#unknown Or not.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Seriously, you're not gonna make me lock you in, are you? Sky? Skyler? Jesus.
#unknown No, I'm fine.
#unknown It's hormones.
#unknown Honestly.
#unknown It happens all the time.
#unknown I'll see you tomorrow.
#unknown What's wrong? I guess it just doesn't feel any different.
#unknown The good news? I mean, nothing's really changed.
#unknown It's just postponed.
#unknown There was supposed to be a light at the end of the tunnel.
#unknown But lately, it just feels like.
#unknown More tunnel.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I just feel so damn ungrateful.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown For me, it was the flu.
#unknown What? My dad rallied at the end.
#unknown I mean, it wasn't the fullon good news Walt got different circumstances, but we were happy we were over the moon.
#unknown And right then, I got sick.
#unknown Flu.
#unknown Knocked me on my ass for days.
#unknown Couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't move.
#unknown Great timing, huh? Yeah.
#unknown And I wasn't even putting two and two together.
#unknown I was just thinking: "Why now?" Being that rock.
#unknown You know being that rock takes everything you got.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown causing the housing prices to trend.
#unknown Foreclosures are being fuelled by a spike in.
#unknown The economy is rapidly deteriorating and unemployment is climbing.
#unknown With Americans losing money over rising inflation and tight spending  the housing market is unlikely to rebound spelling more pain for the economy.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Are you going to work today? Skyler, there's rot.
#unknown I'm going back.
#unknown All right.
#unknown We'll take care of that tomorrow.
#unknown Okay, good night.
#unknown Good night, Ted.
#unknown Good night.
#unknown Oh, damn.

#unknown You're buying the wrong matches.
#unknown What? Those matches.
#unknown They're the wrong kind.
#unknown Red phosphorous is found in the striker strips not the matches themselves.
#unknown You need to get the big 200count box of individual matchbooks.
#unknown More striker strips.
#unknown You understand? Those only have the one.
#unknown And don't buy everything in one place.
#unknown Do it piecemeal.
#unknown Different items, different stores.
