#unknown Good luck.
#unknown Skyler, give me a call when you get a chance.
#unknown Hi, Walt and Skyler.
#unknown This is Gretchen Schwartz  calling to say hello.
#unknown I'm down from Santa Fe today and I was thinking about you both hoping everything's well.
#unknown I tried Walt's cell, and it said the number had been disconnected so I'm just hoping that everything's okay.
#unknown Call me if you can, whenever's convenient.
#unknown Hello? Oh, hi, Gretchen.
#unknown This is Skyler White.
#unknown Am I catching you at a bad time? No.
#unknown No, not at all.
#unknown It's so good to hear from you.
#unknown How is everybody? We're very well, thank you.
#unknown Walt is actually at work today.
#unknown It's his first day back at work and he lost his cell phone quite a while back.
#unknown And I really hope we didn't worry you.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown I'm just so glad to hear that everybody's fine.
#unknown That's wonderful.
#unknown Gretchen, I'm so very, very long overdue in telling you this and I have to take Walt at his word that he's been passing it along for me.
#unknown I mean, he's been so adamant about wanting to handle this whole thing by himself, and.
#unknown But I have picked up the phone about a hundred times.
#unknown I just What? What is it? I can't begin to thank you and Elliott for what you've done.
#unknown The money for Walt's treatment, it's just.
#unknown It saved us.
#unknown I don't know if I.
#unknown Walt keeps saying, " Don't bother them.
#unknown It's no big deal.
#unknown " But it is a big deal.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown To me.
#unknown And to all of us.
#unknown So I just finally wanted to say thank you.
#unknown Anyway.
#unknown End of speech.
#unknown So I do I hope we get to see you soon.
#unknown Truly, anytime you're in town, anytime at all, is good for us.
#unknown How about this afternoon? Yeah, okay.
#unknown Monoalkenes, diolefins trienes, polyenes.
#unknown I mean, the nomenclature alone is enough to make your head spin.
#unknown But when you start to feel overwhelmed and you will just keep in mind that one element carbon.
#unknown Carbon is at the centre of it all.
#unknown There is no life without carbon.
#unknown Nowhere that we know of in the universe.
#unknown Everything that lives, lived, will live, carbon.
#unknown Carmen is carbon.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Assistant Principal Carmen.
#unknown Did you? No.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I like to think of it.
#unknown I like to think that the diamond and the woman who wears it on her finger are both formed from the same stuff.
#unknown Or, say, the diamond and the man who invented it.
#unknown That got your attention, right? The man who invented the diamond.
#unknown All right.
#unknown H.
#unknown Tracy Hall.
#unknown Write this name down.
#unknown Dr.
#unknown Hall invented the first reproducible process .
#unknown .
#unknown for making synthetic diamonds.
#unknown I mean, this is way back in the '50s.
#unknown Now, today, synthetic diamonds are used in oil drilling electronics, multibilliondollar industries.
#unknown At the time, Dr.
#unknown Hall worked for General Electric.
#unknown And he made them a fortune.
#unknown I mean, incalculable.
#unknown You wanna know how GE rewarded Dr.
#unknown Hall? A $10 U.
#unknown S.
#unknown Savings Bond.
#unknown Anyway.
#unknown A savings bond printed on carbonbased paper paid to a carbonbased man.
#unknown for something he made out of carbon.
#unknown It's so nice to have you back with us.
#unknown You're looking great, by the way.
#unknown A little skinnier, which is definitely no tragedy.
#unknown And then there's the hair thing.
#unknown I actually like that.
#unknown That's a great look for you.
#unknown But you're feeling good? Oh, absolutely.
#unknown Hundred percent.
#unknown It's.
#unknown I'm glad to be back at work.

#unknown Oh, man.
#unknown Oh, my hand is cramping up! Oh, my God.

#unknown Shut up! Both of you.
#unknown You know who might have done it? I have an idea.
#unknown Well, here's what I think.
#unknown You ID them, and then together, you and I put a bag over their heads we tie them up, drive them way out into the desert, strip them naked then bury them up to their necks in a huge mound of fire ants.
#unknown Saw it in an old Western.
#unknown You with me? Scorpions? Scorpions are good.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Nice.
#unknown Damn, Dad.
#unknown Check it out.
#unknown Who is this? So this is Walter Jr.

#unknown For good luck, right? Exactly.
#unknown Here's hoping.
#unknown We could use some of that.

#unknown Take out the money, get paid.

#unknown It's a victimless crime.
#unknown Where did you get this? Bodega.

#unknown It's about to give, man.
#unknown I'm sensing it.
#unknown You don't know what you're doing.
#unknown I thought you told me you boosted, like, six of these.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Boosted.
#unknown It's not like he ever got one open.
#unknown At least I got persistence.
#unknown The law of averages, lucky number seven.
#unknown Don't listen to that skank.
#unknown Stop calling me that.
#unknown I ain't no skank! Skank, skank, skank Hey, hey, hey.
#unknown Sit, sit.
#unknown All right, I swear to God I will shoot you both in the face.
#unknown Now, chill.
#unknown You, get that thing open.
#unknown You sit the hell down, and no throwing things.
#unknown Where's the kid? The kid.
#unknown The little kid! What are you asking me for? I got you now, bitch.
#unknown I got you now.
#unknown Didn't see that coming, huh? What kind of mother are you? How about you feed the kid a decent meal every now and then, huh? Give him a bath.
#unknown Put some baby powder on him.
#unknown Get him some decent TV to watch.
#unknown I mean, what is this shit? Are you serious? You give me one hit, and I'll be any kind of mother that you want.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Yeah, Diesel this thing would go easier if we all had a little taste, man.
#unknown Get out of the way.
#unknown Get out of the way! So you didn't tell anyone.
#unknown You didn't tell Elliott.
#unknown Not yet.
#unknown Well, what does that mean? That means exactly what it means.
#unknown That's a determination I have yet to make.
#unknown All right, fair enough.
#unknown I can appreciate that.
#unknown All right.
#unknown First let me say, I very much regret involving you in this.
#unknown This was.
#unknown This entire thing was unfortunate.
#unknown Unfortunate? And I apologise deeply.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Now please tell me why you did it.
#unknown That's not really at issue here.
#unknown Well, you told me your insurance was covering it.
#unknown Was that a lie? If you won't take our money, and your insurance isn't covering it how are you paying for it? This is not an issue that concerns you, Gretchen, okay? Excuse me, Walt.
#unknown It does concern me.
#unknown It concerns me greatly.
#unknown You tell your wife and son that I am paying for your cancer treatment.
#unknown Why are you doing this? I will clear this up with them.
#unknown The look on Skyler's face, she's sitting there, tears in her eyes thanking me for saving your life.
#unknown Why would you do that to her? As I said, I will clear this up.
#unknown Just please allow me to do this in my own way, in my own time.
#unknown All right? I will explain the whole thing to them.
#unknown And while you're at it, explain it to me.
#unknown I don't owe you an explanation.
#unknown I owe you an apology, and I have apologised.
#unknown I am very sorry, Gretchen.
#unknown There.
#unknown I've apologised twice now.
#unknown I'm humbly sorry.
#unknown Three times.
#unknown Let me just get this straight.
#unknown Elliott and I offer to pay for your treatment no strings attached.
#unknown An offer which still stands, by the way.
#unknown And you turn us down out of pride, whatever and then you tell your wife that in fact we are paying for your treatment.
#unknown Without our knowledge, against our will you involve us in your lie.
#unknown And you sit here and tell me that that is none of my business? Yeah.
#unknown That's pretty much the size of it.
#unknown What happened to you? Really, Walt.
#unknown What happened? Because this isn't you.
#unknown What would you know about me, Gretchen? What would your presumption about me be, exactly? That I should go begging for your charity? And you waving your chequebook around like some magic wand is gonna make me forget how you and Elliott How you and Elliott cut me out? What? That can't be how you see it.
#unknown It was my hard work, my research, and you and Elliott make millions off it.
#unknown That cannot be how you see it.
#unknown Good.
#unknown That's beautifully done.
#unknown You left You are always the picture of innocence.
#unknown You left me.
#unknown The picture of innocence.
#unknown Just sweetness and light.
#unknown You left me.
#unknown Newport, 4th of July weekend.
#unknown You and my father and my brothers and I go up to our room and you're packing your bags, barely talking.
#unknown What? Did I dream all of that? That's your excuse to build your little empire on my work? How can you say that to me? You walked away.
#unknown You abandoned us, me, Elliott.
#unknown Little rich girl just adding to your millions.
#unknown I don't even know what to say to you.
#unknown I don't even know where to begin.
#unknown I feel so sorry for you, Walt.
#unknown Fuck you.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey, little man, you hungry? Hey.
#unknown Man.
#unknown No, no, what are you doing? No, what are you doing? Spooge, I got him, I got him.
#unknown Baby, get up and help me.
#unknown Call me a bad mother.
#unknown I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.
#unknown Get up, damn it! Get our dope! Bedtime.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown Who's the big tough guy now, huh? Is that you? Is that you? You're the big man? Try and hit me now, bitch.
#unknown Try and hit me now! Try and hit me now, bitch.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown Should I ask where you've been? Never mind.
#unknown We're long past that, I suppose.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Gretchen called about an hour ago.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown We need to talk.
#unknown Just say it.
#unknown They're cutting off the money.
#unknown What did she say, exactly? Not much.
#unknown It was abrupt.
#unknown She said something like: " I'm sorry to have to do this but Elliott and I can no longer continue to pay for Walt's treatment.
#unknown I wish you the very best.
#unknown " And that was it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I mean, she sounded apologetic.
#unknown I guess.
#unknown It was quick.
#unknown She got right off the phone.
#unknown I was so stunned, but.
#unknown I called her back and she didn't pick up.
#unknown So, what do you know about this? I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice visit this afternoon and then you come home and she's in a big hurry to leave and then the two of you are talking in the driveway.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown What do you know that I don't? Where were you tonight? I drove up to Santa Fe.
#unknown I was with Gretchen.
#unknown Well, Gretchen and Elliott.
#unknown She just couldn't bring herself to tell you today.
#unknown I mean, she couldn't tell me, either, really.
#unknown I mean, there was a lot of hemming and hawing and beating around the bush Okay, what? Tell us what? Well.
#unknown There was a lot of business phraseology being tossed around.
#unknown You know, things like "cashpoor" and " leveraged"  "quarterly decline," yadda, yadda, yadda.
#unknown But what they were truly saying, in my opinion.
#unknown They're broke.
#unknown You are kidding me.
#unknown No.
#unknown I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
#unknown We all know that.
#unknown And all these big banks and Fannie Mae and.
#unknown Well, apparently, Gray Matter is no more immune than anyone else.
#unknown That is Jesus, that's.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You know, she could have just told me herself.
#unknown Well, they're prideful people.
#unknown Listen.
#unknown Not to sound selfish but as far as we go we'll get through this, okay? I mean, they've already paid for most of my treatment, right? Hey.
#unknown We're gonna make it.
#unknown All right? I promise.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown And yet she still drives a Bentley.
#unknown Keeping up appearances.
#unknown Who knows? Baby, that don't make any sense.
#unknown Of course it makes sense.
#unknown Every safe's got its weak spot, right? You're designing a safe, where you gonna put your weak spot? Nowhere.
#unknown I'd make it, like, strong.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown On the bottom, that's where.
#unknown You put your weak spot on the bottom.
#unknown Oh, baby, that H is bringing me down.
#unknown Yeah, you took too much.
#unknown I told you.
#unknown I need to.
#unknown I need to even out.
#unknown Let me get a hit of that crystal.
#unknown Hell, no.
#unknown You lost your share.
#unknown Come on, baby.
#unknown It's all I need, just a little hit.
#unknown Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
#unknown I'm trying to concentrate.
#unknown I ain't no skank.
#unknown I would appreciate an apology.
#unknown What? I am trying to take the high road here.
#unknown Are you gonna do right? Listen to me, stupid.
#unknown I am in the middle of some very important work.
#unknown I am on the verge here, all right? So shut your skank ass pie hole and assist me and shut up.
#unknown I ain't no skank.
#unknown Skank, skank, skank ass skank.
#unknown Skank ass skank.
#unknown Skank ass skank.
#unknown You listening to me, skank? You hear me, skank? You are a skank ass skank.
#unknown Skank.
#unknown Skank, skank, skank.
#unknown Skank.
#unknown I ain't no skank.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Don't.
#unknown No.
#unknown I ain't no skank.
#unknown Hey, hey.
#unknown Hey, you remember peekaboo? Can you go peekaboo like this? Can you keep your eyes closed? You keep them closed.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown That's good.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You keep them closed just like that.
#unknown It's a little game we're gonna play, okay? Here you go.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey, look at me.
#unknown You wait right here.
#unknown Okay? It's just part of the game.
#unknown You wait right here, and.
#unknown Look, just.
#unknown Just don't go back inside.
#unknown All right? You stay right here.
#unknown Okay? You have a good rest of your life, kid.
#unknown
