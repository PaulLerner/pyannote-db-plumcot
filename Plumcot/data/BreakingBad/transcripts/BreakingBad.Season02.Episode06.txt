walter_white  So you didn't tell anyone.
walter_white  You didn't tell Elliott. Not
gretchen_schwartz  Not yet.
walter_white  does that mean
gretchen_schwartz  That means exactly what it means.
gretchen_schwartz  That's a determination I have yet to make
walter_white  I can appreciate
walter_white  appreciate that.
walter_white  right.
walter_white  First let me say, I very much regret involving you in this. This
walter_white  This was.
walter_white  This entire thing was unfortunate.
gretchen_schwartz  Unfortunate?
walter_white  And I apologise deeply.
gretchen_schwartz  Thank you
gretchen_schwartz  Now please tell me why you did it.
walter_white  That's not really at issue here.
gretchen_schwartz  Well, you told me your insurance was covering it.
gretchen_schwartz  Was that a lie?
gretchen_schwartz  If you won't take our money, and your insurance isn't covering it how are you paying for it
walter_white  it? This is not an issue that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?
gretchen_schwartz  Excuse me, Walt.
gretchen_schwartz  It does concern me.
gretchen_schwartz  It concerns me greatly.
gretchen_schwartz  You tell your wife and son that I am paying for your cancer treatment.
gretchen_schwartz  Why are you doing this?
walter_white  I will clear this up with them
gretchen_schwartz  on Skyler's face, she's sitting there, tears in her eyes thanking me for saving your life.
gretchen_schwartz  Why would you do that to her? As
walter_white  As I said, I will clear this up.
walter_white  Just please allow me to do this in my own way, in my own time.
walter_white  All right
walter_white  I will explain the whole thing to them.
gretchen_schwartz  And while you're at it, explain it to me.
walter_white  I don't owe you an explanation.
walter_white  I owe you an apology, and I have apologised.
walter_white  I am very sorry, Gretchen. There. I've apologised twice now. I'm humbly sorry. Three times.
walter_white  Let
gretchen_schwartz  Let me just get this straight.
gretchen_schwartz  Elliott and I offer to pay for your treatment no strings attached.
gretchen_schwartz  An offer which still stands, by the way
gretchen_schwartz  And you turn us down out of pride, whatever and then you tell your wife that in fact we are paying for your treatment.
gretchen_schwartz  Without our knowledge, against our will you involve us in your lie.
gretchen_schwartz  And you sit here and tell me that that is none of my business?
walter_white  That's pretty much the size of it.
gretchen_schwartz  What happened to you?
gretchen_schwartz  What
gretchen_schwartz  Because this isn't you.
walter_white  would you know about me, Gretchen?
walter_white  What would your presumption about me be, exactly?
walter_white  That I should go begging for your charity
walter_white  And you waving your chequebook around like some magic wand is gonna make me forget how you and Elliott How
walter_white  How you and Elliott cut me out? What
gretchen_schwartz  What?
gretchen_schwartz  can't be how you see it.
walter_white  It was my hard work, my research, and you and Elliott make millions off it.
gretchen_schwartz  That cannot be how you see it. Good.
walter_white  That's beautifully done.
gretchen_schwartz  You left You
walter_white  You are always the picture of innocence. You
gretchen_schwartz  You left me.
walter_white  The picture of innocence. Just
walter_white  Just sweetness and light.
gretchen_schwartz  You left me.
gretchen_schwartz  Newport, 4th of July weekend.
gretchen_schwartz  You and my father and my brothers and I go up to our room and you're packing your bags, barely talking.
gretchen_schwartz  What? Did I dream all of that?
walter_white  That's your excuse to build your little empire on my work?
gretchen_schwartz  How can you say that to me?
gretchen_schwartz  You walked away.
gretchen_schwartz  You abandoned us, me, Elliott
walter_white  Elliott. Little rich girl just adding to your millions.
gretchen_schwartz  I don't even know what to say to you.
gretchen_schwartz  I don't even know where to begin.
gretchen_schwartz  I feel so sorry for you, Walt. Fuck you.
jesse_pinkman  you hungry?
jesse_pinkman  you doing?
spooge's_lady  Spooge, I got him, I got him
spooge's_lady  Baby, get up and help me.
spooge's_lady  Call me a bad mother.
spooge's_lady  I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.
spooge's_lady  Get up, damn it!
spooge's_lady  Get our dope! Bedtime.
spooge  Oh, yeah. Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
spooge  that you?
spooge  Is that you?
spooge  You're the big man? Try
spooge  Try and hit me now, bitch.
skyler_white  Should I ask where you've been?
skyler_white  We're long past
walter_white  I suppose
skyler_white  about an hour ago.
walter_white  to talk. Just say it
skyler_white  They're cutting off the money
walter_white  What did she say,
skyler_white  much.
skyler_white  It was abrupt.
skyler_white  She said something like :
skyler_white  I'm sorry to have to do this but Elliott and I can no longer continue to pay for Walt's treatment.
skyler_white  I wish you the very best.
skyler_white  And that was it. Yeah. I mean, she sounded apologetic.
skyler_white  I guess. It was quick.
skyler_white  She got right off the phone.
skyler_white  I was so stunned, but. I called her back and she didn't pick up.
skyler_white  So, what do you know about this?
skyler_white  I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice visit this afternoon and then you come home and she's in a big hurry to leave and then the two of you are talking in the driveway.
skyler_white  What
skyler_white  What do you know that I don't?
skyler_white  Where were you tonight?
walter_white  I drove up to Santa Fe.
walter_white  I was with Gretchen.
walter_white  Well, Gretchen and Elliott.
walter_white  She just couldn't bring herself to tell you today.
walter_white  I mean, she couldn't tell me, either, really.
walter_white  mean, there was a lot of hemming and hawing and beating around the bush Okay
skyler_white  Tell us what?
skyler_white  There was a
walter_white  business phraseology being tossed around.
walter_white  You know, things like" cashpoor" and" leveraged"" quarterly decline," yadda, yadda, yadda. But
walter_white  But what they were truly saying, in my opinion.
walter_white  They're broke.
skyler_white  kidding me.
walter_white  I mean, the economy's in the toilet. We
walter_white  We all know that.
walter_white  And all these big banks and Fannie Mae and.
walter_white  apparently, Gray Matter is no more immune than anyone else.
skyler_white  That
skyler_white  is Jesus, that's.
skyler_white  You know, she could have just told me herself. Well,
walter_white  Not to
walter_white  but as far as we go we'll get through this, okay?
walter_white  I mean, they've already paid for most of my treatment, right?
walter_white  We're gonna
skyler_white  And yet she still drives a Bentley.
walter_white  Keeping up appearances.
spooge's_lady  Who knows? Baby, that don't make any sense. Of course
spooge  course it makes sense. Every
spooge  Every safe's got its weak spot, right?
spooge  You're designing a safe, where you gonna put your weak spot? Nowhere
