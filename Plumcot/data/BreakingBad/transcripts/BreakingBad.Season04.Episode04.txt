support_group_leader_#1  Gambling destroyed my life
support_group_leader_#1  Me, my family, everything I loved.
support_group_leader_#1  It was like a robbery, only I was the thief.
support_group_leader_#1  It's amazing, the stories you tell yourself to justify it
support_group_leader_#1  The lies that lead you to just one more hand, one more spin, one more roll of the dice.
skyler_white  This is our deal, okay?
skyler_white  Marie, no.
skyler_white  You guys are not lifting a finger.
skyler_white  I mean it.
skyler_white  Yeah, we're bringing everything,
skyler_white  so This This is not up for debate, okay?
skyler_white  Now, sweetie, don't worry,
skyler_white  okay?
skyler_white  All
skyler_white  All right. I'll see you soon.
skyler_white  tonight's the night.
skyler_white  No turning back.
skyler_white  Let's
skyler_white  Let's do
walter_white  Okay,
walter_white  so first I assign point values,
walter_white  correlate to the effect of removal.
skyler_white  You going to split the 8s?
walter_white  Skyler, please.
walter_white  Now, the mathematical principle, known as the Kelly Criterion, upon which I devised my own strategy not
walter_white  not dissimilar to the MIT system
skyler_white  system. Walt, you're not teaching them.
walter_white  I thought you wanted me to be thorough.
skyler_white  Just play.
skyler_white  You're taking too long.
walter_white  What, you don't think it behooves me to be able to explain any of this?
skyler_white  It behooves you to be a pro, that's all I'm saying.
skyler_white  That's the fiction,
skyler_white  so chopchop.
walter_white  Don't chopchop me.
walter_white  Now, we both know that the first decision is whether or not to split or surrender on
walter_white  on 8s.
walter_white  Split 'em
walter_white  Good on both.
walter_white  Next decision is whether to double down or not. What
skyler_white  What you should be doing. On 11
walter_white  11, yes. Double
walter_white  Double.
walter_white  Okay, this hand over here, we have a soft 18.
walter_white  The final decision is whether or not is to hit or to stand.
walter_white  Hit it.
walter_white  Becomes a hard 15.
skyler_white  Dealer has a 9.
walter_white  I see that.
walter_white  it.
skyler_white  Okay, let's see what I got.
skyler_white  And 21.
skyler_white  Yep.
walter_white  Okay, this The key thing to remember here is that it's not about any one hand.
walter_white  The key is the number of hands per hour.
skyler_white  Ooh.
walter_white  Let's go again. Zero, minus 1
walter_white  1.
skyler_white  Walt.
walter_white  It's not as if I don't know how to play.
walter_white  I certainly more than understand how to count cards.
skyler_white  Let's just keep going,
walter_white  No, you know what?
walter_white  I'm in recovery. Remember?
walter_white  I shouldn't even be playing.
walter_white  And that is the fiction that we should be sticking to.
skyler_white  You know what?
skyler_white  You're right.
skyler_white  we're not leaving anything to chance.
skyler_white  All right,
skyler_white  let's get started.
skyler_white  I've got a lot of,
skyler_white  got a lot of ground to cover.
walter_white  What is this
skyler_white  We have to get our stories straight.
skyler_white  We've got to be on the same page.
walter_white  a script?
skyler_white  Bullet points. Bullet points?
walter_white  Like
walter_white  Like a novella. This is smart
skyler_white  smart.
skyler_white  You really want to try to sell a DEA agent some illprepared, halfassed, fullofholes story about how we suddenly have enough money to buy a car wash?
walter_white  Am I supposed to memorize this?
skyler_white  We need to practice, Walt.
skyler_white  We need to be wordperfect.
walter_white  Within reason.
skyler_white  We need this story to be solid and sympathetic and most of all completely believable. From
walter_white  From a story that you already told Marie and
walter_white  and you think that she hasn't told Hank?
walter_white  Come on. This is Marie we're talking about here.
skyler_white  No, she hasn't.
skyler_white  She hasn't.
skyler_white  Hank thinks his insurance is paying for everything.
skyler_white  Marie's not telling him that we're paying his therapy bills,
skyler_white  and neither are we.
walter_white  And why is that again?
skyler_white  Really?
walter_white  If we have the gambling story
skyler_white  Did you take money, Walt?
skyler_white  You remember Gretchen and Elliot?
skyler_white  I seem to recall that you'd rather sell drugs than take help.
walter_white  Fine.
skyler_white  Marie will tell Hank in her own time,
skyler_white  and at least we'll have laid the groundwork.
skyler_white  And coming clean with Hank and Jun
skyler_white  Appearing to come clean will be the best thing for everyone.
skyler_white  We talked about this,
skyler_white  okay?
skyler_white  We agreed about this.
walter_white  Yes, we did.
walter_white  It's just What
walter_white  Never mind.
walter_white  Just Okay
skyler_white  So I really think we should tag team the narrative, okay?
skyler_white  We'll each be responsible for certain portions of the story, and then we can,
skyler_white  we can hand off so we don't leave anything out, and it'll seem the most natural.
skyler_white  Okay,
skyler_white  so I'm going to launch with the exciting news that we are buying a car wash Yay
skyler_white  The next logical question Hank will probably ask is"
skyler_white  Where are you getting the money?"
skyler_white  To which I'll say"
skyler_white  We want to tell you the whole story.
skyler_white " It's a doozy, so hold on to your hats.
skyler_white  Do you like that?
walter_white  Sure.
skyler_white  It accomplishes two things.
skyler_white  It keeps it light while letting them know to expect something big.
walter_white  No
walter_white  It's a doozy.
skyler_white  Okay.
skyler_white  Anyway, that's where you will take over, starting with your diagnosis,
skyler_white  pages 1 and 2.
skyler_white  Okay,
skyler_white  and it's It's
skyler_white  It's pretty much going to run parallel to the truth, which makes it easier,
skyler_white  but, um just make sure to really hit the cancer,
skyler_white  really touch on the fear and despair.
skyler_white  It's good to remind them and to get their sympathy right off the bat
skyler_white  bat. We want them to understand why you could do something so stupid.
skyler_white  Now, after that, per pages 3 and 4, after you say" Gambling
skyler_white  Gambling became an addiction, and I just couldn't control it
skyler_white  Do you see that Yes
walter_white  Right there in
skyler_white  in the middle of the page? Okay
skyler_white  Okay. Oh
skyler_white  and I put in that line about robbery. You know, from the G. A. meeting?
skyler_white  I thought that was good.
skyler_white  So next I'll chime in about how it affected our marriage, uh, starting with the confusion, uh, the deceit, why we couldn't tell anyone.
walter_white " terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions.
skyler_white  Yeah.
walter_white  two" terriblys"
skyler_white  It's supposed to show contrition.
walter_white  Well, I just wouldn't use that word.
Walter_White  I would never say the word" terribly.
skyler_white  Phrase it however you want,
skyler_white  okay?
skyler_white  You're jumping ahead.
skyler_white  Now And
walter_white  And why
walter_white  Why am I so ashamed?
skyler_white  Do I really need to answer that?
walter_white  I was and am providing for our family.
skyler_white  Let's just pick up where we left off.
walter_white  I'm weak, and I'm out of control. I mean
walter_white  mean, this whole thing makes me look like
skyler_white  like crap. This has to be a wartsandall story, Walt.
skyler_white  That's how we'll sell it,
skyler_white  and we both look bad.
walter_white  well How do you look bad exactly?
walter_white  Where is the" I slept with my boss" bullet point?
walter_white  I can't seem to find that anywhere.
skyler_white  For a fired schoolteacher who cooks crystal meth, I'd say you're coming out pretty much ahead.
walter_white  I don't like it.
walter_white  I don't want Junior thinking less of me. At
skyler_white  At least you won at gambling.
skyler_white  I'm just the bitch mom who wouldn't cut you any slack.
walter_white  I'm sorry.
walter_white  I'm sorry that I put you through all of this.
walter_white  How's that sound? Hmm? Here. Two"
walter_white  sorrys.
skyler_white  I believe we were on page 5.
skyler_white  So, after you say how very sorry you are In your own words, of course We're almost to the end,
skyler_white  and I say how proud I am of you for joining a 12step program,
skyler_white  and And this is where I think we should enact how we're feeling, you know?
skyler_white  Just a Just a suggestion.
skyler_white  You might look down on the floor with remorse.
skyler_white  What?
skyler_white  You don't have to mean it.
skyler_white  You just stare down at your feet, Walt, okay?
skyler_white  Then, uh, I'm gonna I was thinking of taking Marie's hand and saying something emotional like"
skyler_white  It's such a relief to tell you.
skyler_white  We're just so glad we have a strong family" to help us through this,
skyler_white  that we can all support each other.
skyler_white  And then maybe I'll tear up a little.
skyler_white  I don't know.
skyler_white  just have to see what happens in the moment.
walter_white  You're going to cry? On cue?
skyler_white  I said I don't know. Maybe
skyler_white  Maybe.
walter_white  When you dab your eyes, you going to do it with your right hand or your left? It's just an idea
walter_white  One tear? Two
walter_white  Two tears?
walter_white  This
skyler_white  This has to be convincing,
skyler_white  especially to Hank.
skyler_white  I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.
skyler_white  And yes, I'm thorough.
skyler_white  Maybe lying doesn't come as easily to me as it does to you. Hey! Guys! Come on in. Hi. Good to see you.

hank_schrader  there, you little punk

hank_schrader  Well, that's the manganese part,
hank_schrader  okay?
hank_schrader  It It oxidizes, you know, like rust. Exactly
walter_white  Exactly. Manganese can have an oxidation state of between 3 and +7, which takes it through a range of colors Purple
walter_white  Purple, green, blue.
walter_white  But its most stable state is +2, which is usually pale pink.
hank_schrader  Exactly.

hank_schrader  This is a bigass operation.
hank_schrader  You know, hundreds of pounds a week,
hank_schrader  maybe more.

hank_schrader  Yeah.
hank_schrader  Pretty weird,

hank_schrader  It, uh, it was one of these physicists One of Hitler's guys,
hank_schrader  physicist named Werner Heisenberg.
hank_schrader  Real cute, huh?

hank_schrader  No offense.
hank_schrader  And here we go
hank_schrader  Gale" Major Tom" Boetticher.

walter_white  It looks like you did.
hank_schrader  No, I mean, you know, me personally.
hank_schrader  I wanted to be the one to slap the handcuffs on him, that kind of shit.
hank_schrader  Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.
walter_white  If I recall, at least from the first French Connection, Popeye Doyle never actually caught him.
hank_schrader  Yeah, I guess me and old Popeye, huh?
hank_schrader  day late and a dollar short.
walter_white  What about the person who killed him
hank_schrader  problem, not mine.
walter_white  Any leads?
hank_schrader  My buddy Tim says he's got some fingerprints they're trying to ID,
hank_schrader  eyewitness saw a person of interest.
hank_schrader  Might get lucky there.
hank_schrader  guess somebody knows something.
hank_schrader  They'll track down the shooter eventually.
walter_white  Jesse!
walter_white  Would you stop
walter_white  doing what you're doing, please?
jesse_pinkman  When I'm done,
jesse_pinkman  yo, that dude's next. What
jesse_pinkman  hell?
walter_white  What is wrong I have some business to discuss.
jesse_pinkman  So discuss. Jesus
jesse_pinkman  Jesus.
jesse_pinkman  Let
walter_white  Let go of me. Gale's murder is being investigated.
walter_white  And I have it on good authority that they found fingerprints at the scene.
jesse_pinkman  Not mine.
jesse_pinkman  We done here?
walter_white  No, we are not done here.
walter_white  What if they are yours?
walter_white  How can you be so sure?
jesse_pinkman  Because I'm here,
jesse_pinkman  right? Your brotherinlaw's got such a hardon for me that if the cops would have found my fingerprints Shh.
jesse_pinkman  The cops would have found my fingerprints within five blocks of that place, they would have picked me up by now.
walter_white  about the casing?
walter_white  casings?
walter_white  How many times did you shoot him anyway?
walter_white  Jesse, did you pick up the
walter_white  Did you pick them up?
jesse_pinkman  No.
walter_white  Listen
walter_white  Listen, uh, we've got to go over this step by step Everything.
walter_white  you to tell me exactly what happened from the moment you got there.
jesse_pinkman  I got in, I got out.
walter_white  No.
walter_white  No, I need to know specifics.
walter_white  Now, we'll start from the beginning.
walter_white  You You drove there.
walter_white  You drove over there.
walter_white  You went to his door, right
walter_white  Jesse, I need you to concentrate.
walter_white  This is very important.
walter_white  Did you knock or ring?
walter_white  Knock or ring
jesse_pinkman  Knock. Okay
walter_white  That's
walter_white  That's very good.
walter_white  Now
walter_white  I assume that Gale answered the door.
walter_white  what happened after that?
walter_white  Did he recognize you?
walter_white  Did you say anything to each other
walter_white  Did you walk into the room, or did you shoot him right then and there?
jesse_pinkman  Who wants to make a hundred bucks? Huh?
saul_goodman  Look, the kid's probably right.
saul_goodman  If they had anything on him, he'd be locked up already.
walter_white  What about my brotherinlaw?
walter_white  He suspects Jess Hell
walter_white  Hell, he knows Jesse is involved in the sale of blue meth.
walter_white  That was Hank's one and only lead.
walter_white  Now what if he puts and he goes after Jesse for the murder?
saul_goodman  He goes after him how, on his Rascal Scooter?
saul_goodman  That, perhaps, sounded insensitive.
saul_goodman  but if he goes after him, I'll sue his ass for police brutality, harassment, assault, and 16 other things.
saul_goodman  Now, the history that those two have together being what it is, you got to figure your brotherinlaw's smart enough not to go down that particular road.
saul_goodman  Goose egg,
saul_goodman  bupkis That's
saul_goodman  That's what the cops got.
saul_goodman  I wouldn't worry about it
walter_white  What else should I not worry about, Saul,
walter_white  Should I not worry that Gus plans to murder me at the first chance he gets?
walter_white  Should I not worry that my drugaddicted partner doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies?
walter_white  You should see his house.
walter_white  It's It's like Skid Row.
walter_white  He has actual hobos living there.
walter_white  Now how long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk?
walter_white  Geez, that Mike, that grunting deadeyed cretin suckerpunching me in the In the face.
walter_white  I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.
walter_white  I mean, Western Union Message received.
walter_white  It Let me ask you
walter_white  When did this stop being a business,
walter_white  Why am I the only person capable of behaving in a professional manner?
walter_white  any way you slice it, everyone's in danger.
walter_white  I mean, how How can I protect anyone?
walter_white  My family, Jesse, myself?
saul_goodman  My name never comes up with those guys, does it?
walter_white  Meanwhile, we're buying this stupid car wash.
walter_white  Oh. Yeah
walter_white  That ship has sailed. Bon voyage.
walter_white  We are committed.
walter_white  We already told our family about it,
walter_white  and now Skyler, I'm sure she believes She
walter_white  She needs to believe that everything is neat and tidy,
walter_white  and she's telling herself that I work in this nice quiet little lab with a white lab coat and a pocket protector and when my contract is up I'll just simply hang it all up, tip my hat, and walk away.
walter_white  How
walter_white  How did everything get so screwed up? Yeah,
saul_goodman  do have a little shit creek action happening.
saul_goodman  You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle
saul_goodman  This is a last resort back pocket kind of thing, but if you really got to protect yourself, uhdisappear.
saul_goodman  There's a guy who can make it happen.
saul_goodman  Call him a, uh disappearer.
saul_goodman  For a substantial fee, and I do mean substantial, you and your loved ones can vanish,
saul_goodman  untraceable.
saul_goodman  I mean, he sets you up with a whole new life.
walter_white  like a witness protection kind of thing?
saul_goodman  Beyond. I
saul_goodman  I mean, off the grid. New
saul_goodman  New identities, new everything.
saul_goodman  No one would ever be able to trace you.
saul_goodman  Now, be clear,
saul_goodman  this is an end game, if you get my meaning.
saul_goodman  I mean, there's no coming back.
saul_goodman  Sh You want his card?
walter_white  God, there's got to be something else that I could do.
walter_white  Some way to keep everything from spiraling out of control.
saul_goodman  Well, I mean, from what you told me, it sounds like, uh, Pinkman is first up in the imminent demise department.
walter_white  Gus won't risk letting the police find Jesse.
walter_white  I know him.
walter_white  He won't.
sketchy  I'm not even kidding because
sketchy  because if you really think about it, you can't even see it
sketchy  it, so how can you know just how bad radio frequencies and microwaves and cell phones and stuff are getting you
sketchy  you could be strolling through security at the airport on the way to visit your grandma
jesse_pinkman  or Wake up, bitches! And
sketchy  And then you get waved through a fullbody Xray scanner,
sketchy  the next day you could be dead or dying from all the radiation that they say is safe,
sketchy  but there's no way. It could be because
sketchy  because they have to deliver a concentrated dose,
sketchy  Enough to penetrate through clothes, and so
sketchy  so the accumulated amount could definitely be dangerous to susceptible individuals Hey
jesse_pinkman  Hey, yo. Especially if you're from a rural area and
sketchy  the ozone layer's already thin Yo. Because of the cow farts.
jesse_pinkman  Yo
