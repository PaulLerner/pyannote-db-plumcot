#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad They found a notebook.
#unknown I made a copy for you in case you're interested.
#unknown It pertains to some methamphetamine superlab.
#unknown Money! What are we saying is the source of this money? Walt came up with a story about gambling winnings.
#unknown Blackjack, right? Some card counting.
#unknown Actually that was Skyler's idea.
#unknown I think you are behind all this.
#unknown When the others find out what you've done, maybe we come pay you a visit.
#unknown Ãndale.
#unknown Mueve el culo, cabrÃ³n.
#unknown Ya voy.
#unknown Ya voy.
#unknown Ãndale! Ãbrelo! Did you want me to open the doors? Â¿QuÃ© estÃ¡s haciendo? Â¿Eh? Here.
#unknown The keys.
#unknown Take them.
#unknown Â¿Por quÃ© me estÃ¡s hablando en inglÃ©s? Why you talk English, huh? Â¿QuÃ©? No! No, no, no! No! Ohh Ahh Gambling destroyed my life Me, my family, everything I loved.
#unknown It was like a robbery, only I was the thief.
#unknown It's amazing, the stories you tell yourself to justify it The lies that lead you to just one more hand, one more spin, one more roll of the dice.
#unknown This is our deal, okay? Marie, no.
#unknown You guys are not lifting a finger.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown Yeah, we're bringing everything, so This This is not up for debate, okay? Great.
#unknown Now, sweetie, don't worry, okay? All right.
#unknown I'll see you soon.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown So tonight's the night.
#unknown No turning back.
#unknown Well Okay.
#unknown Let's do this.
#unknown Okay, so first I assign point values, correlate to the effect of removal.
#unknown You going to split the 8s? Skyler, please.
#unknown Now, the mathematical principle, known as the Kelly Criterion, upon which I devised my own strategy not dissimilar to the MIT system.
#unknown Walt, you're not teaching them.
#unknown I thought you wanted me to be thorough.
#unknown Just play.
#unknown You're taking too long.
#unknown What, you don't think it behooves me to be able to explain any of this? It behooves you to be a pro, that's all I'm saying.
#unknown That's the fiction, so chopchop.
#unknown Don't chopchop me.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown Now, we both know that the first decision is whether or not to split or surrender on 8s.
#unknown Split 'em.
#unknown Mmhmm.
#unknown Good on both.
#unknown Next decision is whether to double down or not.
#unknown What you should be doing.
#unknown On 11, yes.
#unknown Double.
#unknown Okay, this hand over here, we have a soft 18.
#unknown The final decision is whether or not is to hit or to stand.
#unknown Hit it.
#unknown Becomes a hard 15.
#unknown Dealer has a 9.
#unknown I see that.
#unknown Hit it.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Okay, let's see what I got.
#unknown And 21.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown Yep.
#unknown Okay, this The key thing to remember here is that it's not about any one hand.
#unknown The key is the number of hands per hour.
#unknown Ooh.
#unknown Let's go again.
#unknown Zero, minus 1.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown It's not as if I don't know how to play.
#unknown I certainly more than understand how to count cards.
#unknown Let's just keep going, okay? No, you know what? I'm in recovery.
#unknown Remember? I shouldn't even be playing.
#unknown And that is the fiction that we should be sticking to.
#unknown You know what? You're right.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Um, we're not leaving anything to chance.
#unknown All right, let's get started.
#unknown I've got a lot of, uh Walt, we've got a lot of ground to cover.
#unknown What is this? We have to get our stories straight.
#unknown We've got to be on the same page.
#unknown Is this a script? Bullet points.
#unknown Bullet points? Like a novella.
#unknown This is smart.
#unknown You really want to try to sell a DEA agent some illprepared, halfassed, fullofholes story about how we suddenly have enough money to buy a car wash? Am I supposed to memorize this? We need to practice, Walt.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown We need to be wordperfect.
#unknown Within reason.
#unknown We need this story to be solid and sympathetic and most of all completely believable.
#unknown From a story that you already told Marie and you think that she hasn't told Hank? Ha! Come on.
#unknown This is Marie we're talking about here.
#unknown No, she hasn't.
#unknown She hasn't.
#unknown Hank thinks his insurance is paying for everything.
#unknown Marie's not telling him that we're paying his therapy bills, and neither are we.
#unknown And why is that again? Really? If we have the gambling story Did you take money, Walt? You remember Gretchen and Elliot? Because I seem to recall that you'd rather sell drugs than take help.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Marie will tell Hank in her own time, and at least we'll have laid the groundwork.
#unknown And coming clean with Hank and Jun Appearing to come clean will be the best thing for everyone.
#unknown We talked about this, okay? We agreed about this.
#unknown Yes, we did.
#unknown It's just What? Never mind.
#unknown Just Okay.
#unknown So I really think we should tag team the narrative, okay? We'll each be responsible for certain portions of the story, and then we can, uh, we can hand off so we don't leave anything out, and it'll seem the most natural.
#unknown Okay, so I'm going to launch with the exciting news that we are buying a car wash Yay.
#unknown The next logical question Hank will probably ask is "Where are you getting the money?" Hmm.
#unknown To which I'll say "We want to tell you the whole story.
#unknown "It's a doozy, so hold on to your hats.
#unknown " Do you like that? Sure.
#unknown It accomplishes two things.
#unknown It keeps it light while letting them know to expect something big.
#unknown Uhhuh.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown No.
#unknown It's a doozy.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Anyway, that's where you will take over, starting with your diagnosis, pages 1 and 2.
#unknown Okay, and it's It's pretty much going to run parallel to the truth, which makes it easier, but, um just make sure to really hit the cancer, really touch on the fear and despair.
#unknown It's good to remind them and to get their sympathy right off the bat.
#unknown We want them to understand why you could do something so stupid.
#unknown Now, after that, per pages 3 and 4, after you say "Gambling became an addiction, and I just couldn't control it.
#unknown " Do you see that Yes.
#unknown Right there in the middle of the page? Okay.
#unknown Oh, and I put in that line about robbery.
#unknown You know, from the G.
#unknown A.
#unknown meeting? I thought that was good.
#unknown So next I'll chime in about how it affected our marriage, uh, starting with the confusion, uh, the deceit, why we couldn't tell anyone.
#unknown "terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions.
#unknown " Yeah.
#unknown There's two "terriblys"? It's supposed to show contrition.
#unknown Well, I just wouldn't use that word.
#unknown I would never say the word "terribly.
#unknown " Phrase it however you want, okay? You're jumping ahead.
#unknown Now And why Why am I so ashamed? Do I really need to answer that? I was and am providing for our family.
#unknown Let's just pick up where we left off.
#unknown I'm weak, and I'm out of control.
#unknown I mean, this whole thing makes me look like crap.
#unknown This has to be a wartsandall story, Walt.
#unknown That's how we'll sell it, and we both look bad.
#unknown Oh, well How do you look bad exactly? Where is the "I slept with my boss" bullet point? I can't seem to find that anywhere.
#unknown For a fired schoolteacher who cooks crystal meth, I'd say you're coming out pretty much ahead.
#unknown I don't like it.
#unknown I don't want Junior thinking less of me.
#unknown At least you won at gambling.
#unknown I'm just the bitch mom who wouldn't cut you any slack.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I'm sorry that I put you through all of this.
#unknown How's that sound? Hmm? Here.
#unknown Two "sorrys.
#unknown " I believe we were on page 5.
#unknown So, after you say how very sorry you are In your own words, of course We're almost to the end, and I say how proud I am of you for joining a 12step program, and And this is where I think we should enact how we're feeling, you know? Just a Just a suggestion.
#unknown You might look down on the floor with remorse.
#unknown Hmm? What? You don't have to mean it.
#unknown You just stare down at your feet, Walt, okay? Then, uh, I'm gonna I was thinking of taking Marie's hand and saying something emotional like "It's such a relief to tell you.
#unknown "We're just so glad we have a strong family "to help us through this, that we can all support each other.
#unknown " And then maybe I'll tear up a little.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown I'll just have to see what happens in the moment.
#unknown You're going to cry? On cue? I said I don't know.
#unknown Maybe.
#unknown When you dab your eyes, you going to do it with your right hand or your left? It's just an idea.
#unknown One tear? Two tears? This has to be convincing, especially to Hank.
#unknown I'm doing the best I can here, Walt.
#unknown And yes, I'm thorough.
#unknown Maybe lying doesn't come as easily to me as it does to you.
#unknown Hey! Guys! Come on in.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Good to see you.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Put her there, you little punk.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Great to see you, Hank.
#unknown Hey, buddy.
#unknown How you doing? Oh, look at my little princess.
#unknown She's getting big, huh? An heavy, too.
#unknown Whoa, is that actual food I'm smelling? I might get an honesttoGod meal here for once? You look good.
#unknown Thank you, sweetheart.
#unknown Your aunt Marie, she's cute, but she could burn water, you know what I'm saying? You are so very hilarious.
#unknown Go show the boys your new rock collection.
#unknown We're going to get things organized.
#unknown Yeah, it'll be about 10 minutes.
#unknown You have a rock collection? It's a mineral collection.
#unknown Uh, just a little something I You guys want to see it? Want to see it? Sure.
#unknown Let's go see it.
#unknown Oh, hey, let me.
#unknown Hey, it's all right.
#unknown I got it.
#unknown Come on, guys, it's down the hall here.
#unknown Now that one there, that's Rhodonite, okay? It's manganese inosilicate.
#unknown Cool.
#unknown What What makes it be all pink like that? Well, that's the manganese part, okay? It It oxidizes, you know, like rust.
#unknown Exactly.
#unknown Manganese can have an oxidation state of between 3 and +7, which takes it through a range of colors Purple, green, blue.
#unknown But its most stable state is +2, which is usually pale pink.
#unknown So Exactly.
#unknown Whatever the hell he said.
#unknown Anyway, you, uh, you get the idea.
#unknown Yeah, it's, uh, interesting.
#unknown Interesting stuff, that.
#unknown Really.
#unknown Oh, hey, uh, here.
#unknown Give me that file, will you? You got to check this out.
#unknown I, uh, have been working on something here.
#unknown Been a little, uh, little consulting You know, weighing in on a case for APD.
#unknown Put that in, will you? Put that in over there.
#unknown Uh, Hank, what is this? It's not a dead body No, no, no, no.
#unknown Nothing like that.
#unknown You guys Seriously, you got to check this out.
#unknown This is good.
#unknown Ready? Here we go on here.
#unknown Look at this guy.
#unknown Look.
#unknown A ship is waiting   All systems are go   Control is not convinced   But the computer has the evidence  Look at that guy.
#unknown No need to abort   Countdown starts  Oh, man.
#unknown You can't make this stuff up.
#unknown 4, 3, 2, 1   Earth below us  Who is this? That, my friends, is Albuquerque's public enemy number 1.
#unknown weightless   Calling, calling   Home  It's such a relief to finally tell you.
#unknown We're just so glad that we have a strong family to help us through this, that we can all support each other.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown I don't even know where Holy shit.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Walter H.
#unknown Whyte.
#unknown Man of hidden talents.
#unknown Dad, you're such a stud.
#unknown How much did you win exactly? Dad? I I don't think I have exact figures.
#unknown It's, uh, it's enough to Uh, after taxes, of course To buy the car wash.
#unknown Maybe even pay for a couple of halfway reasonable college educations.
#unknown Damn, Dad, why'd you quit? I can totally get a car for my birthday now.
#unknown Right? Son, I'm terribly, terrible ashamed of my actions.
#unknown Would you excuse me, please? I need to use the restroom.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown Walt? Hey.
#unknown Whoa, whoa.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown I I thought you might have fallen in there.
#unknown Uh, no, no.
#unknown I just, uh Hey, man, that was some big stuff back there.
#unknown Yeah, we wanted to be thorough, so Yeah, well, it's quite a tale.
#unknown It couldn't have been easy to talk about.
#unknown You know, Walt, if you you can always bend my ear, right? I mean, if you ever need to talk or Or just blow off some steam.
#unknown I'm I'm here.
#unknown Not going anywhere.
#unknown Thanks, Hank.
#unknown Same goes for me, you know.
#unknown If you ever want to bounce anything off me.
#unknown I don't know, case work, anything, really.
#unknown Sometimes just talking something through, you know, really can make a difference.
#unknown I mean, we're definitely not talking, you know, bathtub crank here.
#unknown This is a bigass operation.
#unknown You know, hundreds of pounds a week, maybe more.
#unknown So, uh who is this person? What do you know about him? Other than the fact that he's deader than a Texas salad bar and has a decent set of pipes? I'd say he's my guy.
#unknown Your guy? There's this, uh, mystery man I've been, uh, chasing for the better part of a year.
#unknown Cooks the purest meth that, uh, me or anyone else has ever seen.
#unknown Goes by the name of Heisenberg.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Pretty weird, huh? I I I looked him up.
#unknown It, uh, it was one of these physicists One of Hitler's guys, a physicist named Werner Heisenberg.
#unknown Real cute, huh? Anyway, I figure with a handle like that, you know, my guy's got to be some sort of an egghead.
#unknown No offense.
#unknown And here we go Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.
#unknown Anyway, I I I just want to see if I'm, you know, not barking up the wrong tree chemically speaking.
#unknown Uh, as far as I can make out, he's writing about phenylacetone cook, right? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That's pretty rare these days, but it It does jive with the blue stuff I've been tracking.
#unknown "2 sticks dairy free soy margarine, It's a recipe for vegan s'mores.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown There's all kinds of crazy crap in there.
#unknown Yeah, like, uh, you know, top ten recumbent bicycles, indoor composting tips.
#unknown All right next to the The mother of, uh, of methamphetamine synthesis.
#unknown This guy was a, uh Man, he was a real character.
#unknown Yeah, he seems, uh, unique.
#unknown Here, let me Let me Let me show you something.
#unknown Give it Give it.
#unknown Right here at the, uh And here's the top.
#unknown It says, uh, "To W.
#unknown W.
#unknown My star, my perfect silence.
#unknown " Huh.
#unknown W.
#unknown W.
#unknown I mean, who do you figure that is, huh? Woodrow Wilson? Willy Wonka? Walter Whyte? You got me.
#unknown W.
#unknown W.
#unknown Hey, man, let me see this for a second because I think I remembered Ah.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown "When I heard the learn'd astronomer" Learned.
#unknown "And from time to time "looked up in perfect silence at the stars.
#unknown " It's a poem by Walt Whitman.
#unknown Your W.
#unknown W.
#unknown You frickin' braniac.
#unknown Ha.
#unknown You frickin' braniac.
#unknown Ha ha ha! I must have skipped that day in school or something.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Hee hee! I've been chasing my tail about that one, you know? I bet you're right.
#unknown Well, I'm glad I could be of help.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Walt Whitman, huh.
#unknown So, uh, you think this Gale person is your Heisenberg? Yeah, I think so.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown God, I wanted to get this guy.
#unknown It looks like you did.
#unknown No, I mean, you know, me personally.
#unknown I wanted to be the one to slap the handcuffs on him, that kind of shit.
#unknown Popeye Doyle waving to Frog One.
#unknown If I recall, at least from the first French Connection, Popeye Doyle never actually caught him.
#unknown Ha.
#unknown Yeah, I guess me and old Popeye, huh? A day late and a dollar short.
#unknown What about the person who killed him? APD's problem, not mine.
#unknown Any leads? My buddy Tim says he's got some fingerprints they're trying to ID, and an eyewitness saw a person of interest.
#unknown Might get lucky there.
#unknown I guess somebody knows something.
#unknown They'll track down the shooter eventually.
#unknown Jesse! Excuse me.
#unknown Jesse? What's up? I need to talk to you, okay? Now.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown Would you stop doing what you're doing, please? When I'm done, yo, that dude's next.
#unknown What the hell? What is wrong I have some business to discuss.
#unknown So discuss.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Let go of me.
#unknown Gale's murder is being investigated.
#unknown Uh, duh.
#unknown And I have it on good authority that they found fingerprints at the scene.
#unknown Not mine.
#unknown We done here? No, we are not done here.
#unknown What if they are yours? How can you be so sure? Because I'm here, all right? Your brotherinlaw's got such a hardon for me that if the cops would have found my fingerprints Shh.
#unknown The cops would have found my fingerprints within five blocks of that place, they would have picked me up by now.
#unknown What about the casing? Or casings? How How many times did you shoot him anyway? Jesse, did you pick up the casings? Did you pick them up? No.
#unknown Listen, uh, we've got to go over this step by step Everything.
#unknown I want you to tell me exactly what happened from the moment you got there.
#unknown I got in, I got out.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, I need to know specifics.
#unknown Now, we'll start from the beginning.
#unknown You You drove there.
#unknown You drove over there.
#unknown You went to his door, right? Jesse, I need you to concentrate.
#unknown This is very important.
#unknown Did you knock or ring? Knock or ring? Uhh! Knock.
#unknown Okay, good.
#unknown That's very good.
#unknown Now listen.
#unknown I assume that Gale answered the door.
#unknown Now what happened after that? Did he recognize you? Did you say anything to each other? Did you walk into the room, or did you shoot him right then and there? What? Who wants to make a hundred bucks? Huh? Look, the kid's probably right.
#unknown If they had anything on him, he'd be locked up already.
#unknown What about my brotherinlaw? He suspects Jess Hell, he knows Jesse is involved in the sale of blue meth.
#unknown That was Hank's one and only lead.
#unknown Now what if he puts and he goes after Jesse for the murder? He goes after him how, on his Rascal Scooter? Ahem.
#unknown That, perhaps, sounded insensitive.
#unknown Uh, but if he goes after him, I'll sue his ass for police brutality, harassment, assault, and 16 other things.
#unknown Now, the history that those two have together being what it is, you got to figure your brotherinlaw's smart enough not to go down that particular road.
#unknown Goose egg, bupkis That's what the cops got.
#unknown I wouldn't worry about it.
#unknown What else should I not worry about, Saul, hmm? Should I not worry that Gus plans to murder me at the first chance he gets? Should I not worry that my drugaddicted partner doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies? You should see his house.
#unknown It's It's like Skid Row.
#unknown He has actual hobos living there.
#unknown Now how long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk? Geez, that Mike, that grunting deadeyed cretin suckerpunching me in the In the face.
#unknown I've got Gus wielding a box cutter.
#unknown I mean, Western Union Message received.
#unknown It Let me ask you.
#unknown When did this stop being a business, hmm? Why am I the only person capable of behaving in a professional manner? No, I No, any way you slice it, everyone's in danger.
#unknown I mean, how How can I protect anyone? My family, Jesse, myself? My name never comes up with those guys, does it? Meanwhile, we're buying this stupid car wash.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown That ship has sailed.
#unknown Bon voyage.
#unknown We are committed.
#unknown We already told our family about it, and now Skyler, I'm sure she believes She needs to believe that everything is neat and tidy, and she's telling herself that I work in this nice quiet little lab with a white lab coat and a pocket protector and when my contract is up I'll just simply hang it all up, tip my hat, and walk away.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown How did everything get so screwed up? Yeah, you do have a little shit creek action happening.
#unknown You know, FYI, you can buy a paddle.
#unknown This is a last resort back pocket kind of thing, but if you really got to protect yourself, uhdisappear.
#unknown Poof.
#unknown Poof? There's a guy who can make it happen.
#unknown Call him a, uh disappearer.
#unknown For a substantial fee, and I do mean substantial, you and your loved ones can vanish, untraceable.
#unknown I mean, he sets you up with a whole new life.
#unknown What, like a witness protection kind of thing? Beyond.
#unknown I mean, off the grid.
#unknown New identities, new everything.
#unknown No one would ever be able to trace you.
#unknown Now, be clear, this is an end game, if you get my meaning.
#unknown I mean, there's no coming back.
#unknown Sh You want his card? Ahh.
#unknown God, there's got to be something else that I could do.
#unknown Some way to keep everything from spiraling out of control.
#unknown Well, I mean, from what you told me, it sounds like, uh, Pinkman is first up in the imminent demise department.
#unknown Gus won't risk letting the police find Jesse.
#unknown I know him.
#unknown He won't.
#unknown I'm not even kidding because if you really think about it, you can't even see it, so how can you know just how bad radio frequencies and microwaves and cell phones and stuff are getting you? I mean, you could be strolling through security at the airport on the way to visit your grandma or Wake up, bitches! And then you get waved through a fullbody Xray scanner, and the next day you could be dead or dying from all the radiation that they say is safe, but there's no way.
#unknown It could be because they have to deliver a concentrated dose, okay? Enough to penetrate through clothes, and so the accumulated amount could definitely be dangerous to susceptible individuals Hey, yo.
#unknown Especially if you're from a rural area and the ozone layer's already thin Yo.
#unknown Because of the cow farts.
#unknown Yo! Oh, hey.
#unknown Will you make sure there's pizza here when I get back? Enough for everybody.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown I can do that.
#unknown I can definitely do that.
#unknown All right? Not a problem, all right? I can get the stuff, the pizza and stuff, but as As far as the financial situation, you know.
#unknown Just hang on, hang on.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown You know, and, you know, if there's a concentrated dose, it's really It's gonna It's gonna play hob with your bone marrow, and it's really gonna mess up Because Because Because, especially, if you have cancer, and you know, because if you got to get a bone marrow transplant, your odds are Are 60%.
#unknown You have a 60% chance.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey! Get some dipping sticks too, yo.
#unknown Uh, I can I can definitely get dipping sticks.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I can get them.

#unknown Okay, thanks.
#unknown You want to know what's next for Little Miss Pissed In His Pants? No.
#unknown You sure now? Yep.
#unknown Don't even want to take a wild guess? You're gonna kill him.
#unknown Is this the part where I'm supposed to beg you not to do it? Aw, please, please.
#unknown And then what? I'm supposed to promise, cross my heart, to, like, straighten up and fly right or toe the line or some other crap that I'm not gonna say? Is that what your little show here was all about? You're on thin ice, you little shit head.
#unknown You know that? You ain't gonna smoke that dude in there.
#unknown You know how come I know? Because you went to the trouble of putting a blindfold on him.
#unknown I'm going back to bed.
#unknown Let yourselves out.
#unknown I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
#unknown How's the ear? Mending.
#unknown What can I do for you? It's Pinkman.
#unknown He's become increasingly incautious.
#unknown He's a risk, a liability.
#unknown I know he and Walter come as a team and that Walter won't like it.
#unknown But something's got to be done.
#unknown Got to be kidding me.
#unknown Hey, it's me.
#unknown Wait for the thing.
#unknown All right, this is message number 3.
#unknown You better be ready in two minutes because I am right outside your door.
#unknown Jesse! Jesse! Damn it.
#unknown Hey, it's me.
#unknown Wait for the thing.
#unknown Oh, great.
#unknown Jesse! Oh, this is perfect.
#unknown You are a piece of work, you know that? Jesse? Jesse.
#unknown Jesse? Hey, it's me.
#unknown Wait for the thing.
#unknown Where is he? Going to ask where we're going? Nope.
#unknown
