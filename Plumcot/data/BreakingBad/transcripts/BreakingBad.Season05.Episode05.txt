#unknown Hey, man, look at the sad sack I found moping around the lobby.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey, there, Walt.
#unknown How you doing, buddy?  Good.
#unknown Listen, I'm sorry to drop in on you out of the blue.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown If it's a bad time, I could No.
#unknown I'm just kind of settling into the new digs here.
#unknown What do you think? It is very nice.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Congratulations again.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown We're all very proud of you.
#unknown Oh, well, thanks.
#unknown My days of chasing dirtballs is over.
#unknown But I'll tell you what, being a boss own kind of grind, you know what I'm saying? Steve, would you mind if I've gotta run something by Hank, if it's all right.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, hey, somebody's gotta go chase the bad guys.
#unknown Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
#unknown Thanks again, Steve.
#unknown Appreciate it.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Look at that.
#unknown Jesus, Walt.
#unknown That's nice.
#unknown Let me see that.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Wow, that's beautiful.
#unknown Was it a birthday present?  Yeah.
#unknown Well, I mean, not really.
#unknown I bought it for myself.
#unknown Hey, well, have a seat.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown New car, new watch.
#unknown Good for you.
#unknown With all the curveballs that were thrown at you this year you deserve to treat yourself.
#unknown I mean, as long as you got the money to spend, that is.
#unknown So how's Sky? Actually, she went to work this morning.
#unknown She wanted to.
#unknown She said she needed to, you know, keep her mind occupied, and  That's good.
#unknown Great, actually.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I mean, as long as you're all right with her being on her own and stuff.
#unknown Yeah, well, you know, I'm right there with her most of the time.
#unknown And Mariano kind of keeps an eye on her when I'm not, so  Good.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown And what about the whole idea of talking to somebody? You know, Marie goes off about Dave like he's a rock star shrink, you know? They come in like zombies, out like larks, you know what I'm saying? That's great.
#unknown Actually, she already found someone.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Peter I don't know why I'm drawing a blank on his last name.
#unknown Peter Anyway, he's out in Rio Rancho.
#unknown He's supposed to be topnotch.
#unknown Good, good.
#unknown I'm glad you're on it.
#unknown That's not something you wanna let fester.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, you don't.
#unknown You don't.
#unknown Hank, I just I wanted to thank you and Marie for watching the kids.
#unknown No, it's It really is No, it's nice of you and I'd like to come by tonight and see them, if that's all right.
#unknown Of course.
#unknown What do you mean? You don't have to ask that.
#unknown It's great having them.
#unknown They're great kids.
#unknown I appreciate that.
#unknown I do.
#unknown Something else on your mind there, Walt? Walt, feel free to, you know Skyler doesn't love me anymore.
#unknown And I don't know what to do, Hank.
#unknown I don't.
#unknown She She says that I'm a bad influence on the kids and that I'm not  Not good for them.
#unknown Jeez, Walt.
#unknown No.
#unknown She thinks I'm a bad father.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown Hey, I mean, Sky and you got your issues but that there, that's That's I mean, I'm no I'm not an expert on parenting or anything, but from where I'm sitting I just don't see it, you know? I mean, I I think you're great with the kids.
#unknown I think you're great with the kids.
#unknown You're a provider, a role model, you know? Hell, the guts you showed going toetotoe with cancer that alone, that's an inspiration to me, you know?  No, I've made mistakes, you know?  Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, I know.
#unknown Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.
#unknown You want a coffee?  Yeah.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.
#unknown I'm gonna give you a moment to just get it together there.
#unknown You want cream and sugar? Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Hank, I'm sorry.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown That Cup of coffee, right? All right.
#unknown Just take a moment.
#unknown Take a moment.
#unknown You know, you two are really great together.
#unknown Take it from me, buddy, it's always darkest just before the dawn.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown What is this place? What is this place? What are we doing here?  Get me the table.
#unknown I can't be here.
#unknown My daughter, my little girl, she's gonna be home soon.
#unknown What? What are you doing?  Mike, Mike, Mike  Shut up! Give me her phone.
#unknown All right, Lydia.
#unknown My friends here don't know you like I do so they are very kindly giving you one last chance.
#unknown There's your script.
#unknown Study it.
#unknown In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader on your line here and you're gonna pass along this information and then we'll see what we see.
#unknown But here are the rules: If you yell for help, try to give the man some kind of coded message or otherwise tip him off I am gonna pull out my pistol and shoot you in the head.
#unknown Same goes for panicking, breaking down into tears.
#unknown Remember how you like to do that? If it happens this time, I am going to pull my pistol out and I am going to shoot you in the head.
#unknown Look at me, not at them.
#unknown Lydia, look at me.
#unknown If you make Schrader suspicious in any way any way at all, tell me what's gonna happen next.
#unknown You'll pull out your gun and shoot me.
#unknown And where will I shoot you?  In the head.
#unknown In the head.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown And it's a pistol, not a gun.
#unknown I'm expecting precision here.
#unknown We up and running? Yeah.
#unknown Computer's set.
#unknown Okay, Lydia.
#unknown If you ever needed to give the performance of a lifetime it's now.
#unknown You're up.
#unknown A SA C 's office Hi.
#unknown Lydia RodarteQuayle calling for Agent Schrader.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown What's this regarding? Madrigal Electromotive.
#unknown Lydia.
#unknown Rodarte.
#unknown Quayle.
#unknown Hold, please.
#unknown Hank, Lydia RodarteQuayle on line one.
#unknown Hank Schrader.
#unknown How can I help you, Ms.
#unknown Quayle? Well, this is kind of an odd It's just that I was in our warehouse supervising a shipment of chemicals when I noticed a device on the bottom of one of our barrels of methylamine.
#unknown A device?  Yeah.
#unknown I guess you'd call it that.
#unknown I mean I'm certainly no expert, but it looks to me like some kind of a A tracking device or a GPS.
#unknown So I was just wondering if maybe your people put it there.
#unknown Not that it's any of my business, but the last thing I wanna do is interfere with a law enforcement operation or a sting or whatever you call it.
#unknown So, I don't know maybe you could give me some guidance? Well, I'll tell you what.
#unknown Set that barrel aside for me, if you would and I'll look into it and get back to you.
#unknown And in the meantime, mum's the word, all right? Yeah.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Sure thing.
#unknown Okay, great.
#unknown Thanks for the call, Ms.
#unknown Quayle.
#unknown Byebye.
#unknown Hey, Gomey, come here, would you?  Yeah?  Hey, man.
#unknown You know anything about GPS trackers on a methylamine barrel? Madrigal Houston, I'm talking about.
#unknown Nope.
#unknown Nobody from my team planted anything.
#unknown Why? Oh, I don't know.
#unknown I figured as much.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown I know what you're thinking, but I didn't do it.
#unknown I'm telling you, I didn't plant that thing.
#unknown Shut up.
#unknown And there you have it, like I said.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So now what? It's not the DEA's, so Schrader's probably thinking some crew planted it looking for a weak spot to pull a heist.
#unknown He's gonna send a team over to that warehouse.
#unknown He's gonna wire it out the wazoo.
#unknown Bugs, cameras, the whole nine yards.
#unknown So the warehouse is too hot.
#unknown Her supply is useless to us now.
#unknown It depends on how fast Schrader can get his guys there.
#unknown We're 900 miles closer, after all.
#unknown I say we keep listening, suss out how much time we have.
#unknown If it's at least 12 hours, then we head down there use her security code to gain access and we take every barrel we can.
#unknown UHaul can only take six or seven before the suspension gives out.
#unknown It's a stopgap.
#unknown But right now, it's the best we can do.
#unknown Well, what about her? You two drive the barrels back tonight.
#unknown I'll deal with her.
#unknown No! No, no, no.
#unknown You're making a mistake.
#unknown This was not me! I swear to God I didn't do it! I don't know.
#unknown Sounds like she's telling the truth to me.
#unknown She has a gun to her head, kid.
#unknown Everyone sounds like Meryl Streep with a gun to their head.
#unknown I'm sorry, Jesse.
#unknown You're the one who wanted to put it up to a vote.
#unknown It's two against one.
#unknown No.
#unknown No! You can't kill me! Come on! I swear I didn't do anything! Janice, give me Doughty in the Houston office, will you? You got it.
#unknown Hank Schrader for Mr.
#unknown Doughty.
#unknown He's on the line.
#unknown Hey, Erol.
#unknown Please tell me you guys didn't do something as lamebrained as put a GPS tracker on the outside of a barrel of methylamine.
#unknown One earmarked for the Madrigal warehouse in Houston? Who's asking? Did someone find them? Jesus.
#unknown Are you shitting me? Since when do you put a GPS tracker  on the outside of a barrel?  We didn't have time to go in with hazard suits, Hank.
#unknown They were about to ship.
#unknown We epoxied them to the bottom.
#unknown They were wellhidden.
#unknown Oh, really? Well, not wellhidden enough.
#unknown How many barrels you tag? All of them.
#unknown All the ones headed to the warehouse, anyway.
#unknown Christ.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Well, sit tight.
#unknown Let me figure out how to play this.
#unknown Next time, a little communication first, all right?  Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
#unknown Asshole.
#unknown Aside Aside from the fact that we almost killed this woman, all of those barrels are already marked.
#unknown We solve the problem we can.
#unknown This has not changed the equation one iota for her.
#unknown Oh, come on! You are not seriously still considering killing me? I saved you! If it weren't for me, we'd all be in jail right now.
#unknown I hate to say it, but she's right, Mike.
#unknown She saved our asses by finding that thing.
#unknown She is saving herself.
#unknown She's a loose cannon.
#unknown I am telling you, she will turn a gun or a badge on us the first chance she gets.
#unknown The woman put a hit out on me.
#unknown Seriously? Wait.
#unknown A hit? What? Like the mafia? Yeah, like the mafia.
#unknown Hey! You still need methylamine, don't you? Right? You wanna talk methylamine? Then tell your partner to stop threatening me, and let's talk.
#unknown Talk about what? You heard.
#unknown You can't even get us a single barrel.
#unknown Who said anything about barrels? I'm talking about an ocean of the stuff.
#unknown Just give him a minute, would you? Trust him.
#unknown "Trust him.
#unknown " Okay.
#unknown So, let's hear it.
#unknown Not without a guarantee that once I tell you how to get what you want  I won't be killed anyway.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown You have my word.
#unknown Not good enough.
#unknown Look, lady  Do you have children?  That has nothing to do with this.
#unknown It's not a trick question.
#unknown Why don't you just answer it? Yes, I have children.
#unknown So what? You think that somehow because we're both parents that I won't let my partner do what's necessary?  Swear on their lives.
#unknown Oh, what? Swear on your children's lives that I won't be harmed.
#unknown Otherwise, how can I trust you? Look, you're a smart businesswoman.
#unknown You understand the concept of leverage.
#unknown Please don't patronize me.
#unknown I hate that.
#unknown You have none.
#unknown But trust has to work both ways, Lydia.
#unknown Is it true that you put a hit out on Mike?  Yes.
#unknown Why? I was scared.
#unknown Of Mike?  Not at first.
#unknown There are men who used to work with Gus Fring in custody now.
#unknown Nine of them.
#unknown They know everything about me.
#unknown Everything.
#unknown Some of them even know about you, assuming you're the master chemist they're always talking about.
#unknown And if it's these nine that you're worried about  why put the hit on Mike?  I had no choice.
#unknown I'm not going to prison and have my daughter raised in a group home.
#unknown Do you have any idea what those places are like? I gave him a list of names but instead of handling it, he's protecting them.
#unknown So I hired someone else.
#unknown At that point, there was no option but to add Mike to the list.
#unknown This ocean of methylamine that you claim you can get your hands on how much are we talking about, literally? How does 24,000 gallons sound? Once a week, on a Wednesday, a freight train leaves the Port of Long Beach loaded with industrial chemicals.
#unknown There's always at least one tanker car full of methylamine which we import from a manufacturer in Guangzhou.
#unknown The train travels east through Arizona stops at a rail yard outside Flagstaff where it gets broken down and rebuilt.
#unknown But the methylamine always moves on destined for our pesticide concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.
#unknown Which means that it passes right through your home state.
#unknown There's a remote threemile stretch here in McKinley County.
#unknown That's where you do it.
#unknown That's where we do what exactly? Get your methylamine.
#unknown Like, rob it? Like Jesse James?  You want the stuff? I'm offering you enough to fill a swimming pool.
#unknown You are offering us a quick trip to prison.
#unknown That's what I'm hearing.
#unknown Stopping a train, post 9/11? You have any idea how many alarms that'll set off between here and D.
#unknown C.
#unknown ? None, if you do it right here.
#unknown If a freight train is stopped in transit anywhere other than the usual yards or depots absolutely, a signal will alarm the FRA and the TSA Surface Division at the Department of Homeland Security.
#unknown But what you don't know and I do, because my job requires me to keep track of my buyers' shipments this is dark territory.
#unknown What's that?  Trainspeak for an area of no contact.
#unknown It's a dead zone.
#unknown No automated supervision system no alarms, no contact with control.
#unknown What about cell phones?  Crew could just call the cops.
#unknown No cellular either.
#unknown I'm telling you, it's the perfect place.
#unknown You'd have time enough to stop the train siphon off as much methylamine as you can carry  get away before the police are called.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown Assuming we can stop a moving train how do we know we have the right one? And which tanker car is which? I can't believe that they would advertise their contents.
#unknown Once the train gets rebuilt in Flagstaff a final manifest gets uploaded to my company's server.
#unknown I'll have it for you sometime between midnight and 2 a.
#unknown m.
#unknown That'll give you at least six hours of lead time.
#unknown Keep in mind, I'm taking a huge risk supplying this information.
#unknown I expect to be paid.
#unknown We can talk percentages later.
#unknown You know what this means, don't you? We've gotta off the crew.
#unknown How do you figure? If we don't, the engineer's gonna call the cops as soon as he gets out of the dead zone.
#unknown It's only three miles long.
#unknown We're way out in the boonies.
#unknown I don't care if it's in the Gobi Desert.
#unknown Once they get word, the FBI and Homeland Security are gonna swoop down with choppers on us so fast, it'll make our heads spin.
#unknown And there is no hiding in that open country.
#unknown How many in the crew?  Just two.
#unknown An engineer and a conductor.
#unknown Assuming there are no security guards.
#unknown No guards.
#unknown It's not like we're carrying nuclear warheads.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Two guys.
#unknown Can't we just tie them up or something? And then what? Even if we wear a mask, we're leaving two witnesses behind.
#unknown Bottom line, I have done this long enough to know that there are two kinds of heists: Those where the guys get away with it and those that leave witnesses.
#unknown Give me a break.
#unknown You guys were gonna murder me.
#unknown I thought you were professionals.
#unknown Can you say "ASAC"? "ASAC.
#unknown " Can you say that? Say, "ASAC Schrader.
#unknown " If those turn out to be her first words, I will beat you with my shoe.
#unknown Don't listen to him, Holly.
#unknown I'm just telling it like it is, babe.
#unknown Boss man.
#unknown I'm the boss man.
#unknown Say, "Boss man.
#unknown " Am I the boss man? I'm the boss.
#unknown Hey, that better be something from a boob instead of some fake soy crap.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown My little girl  Your little girl.
#unknown deserves the real McCoy.
#unknown No.
#unknown See?  Okay.
#unknown She doesn't want it.
#unknown No, she wants me.
#unknown She wants me.
#unknown Yeah, my little girl, because I'm not giving her back.
#unknown Yeah, I know.
#unknown What about Emo McGee? Has he come out of his room today? Barely.
#unknown When he does, he barely talks.
#unknown Yeah, well, what do you expect, you know? His parents treat him like he's a baby there.
#unknown Flynn, do you want me to heat up some of that lasagne to hold you over till dinner? No.
#unknown Hey, I picked up Heat on Bluray.
#unknown Wanna watch it with me later? No.
#unknown And you can keep talking about me now.
#unknown Well, if no one else is gonna offer an opinion, I will.
#unknown We do it the oldfashioned way.
#unknown We hit skid row, the Crystal Palace, all the halfway houses scrounge up about a dozen skells, put them to work smurfing cold pills.
#unknown You mean switch back to a pseudo cook.
#unknown You're the chemist.
#unknown Admittedly, it's gonna cut down on our output.
#unknown Like a factor of four or five.
#unknown It also means that we will eat $80,000 we just invested in our new lab equipment which is only good for a P2P cook.
#unknown You know, I don't have to do the math to know that we'd be making a fraction of the profit.
#unknown And making less money is better than making nothing.
#unknown Oh, yeah, Mike? Well, why don't you tell us why? Why is making nothing not an option?  Walter  Let me tell you why.
#unknown It's because of your nine guys in lockup, right? You broke it, you pay for it.
#unknown And we've talked about this plenty already.
#unknown Well, maybe we better talk about it a little more because what it sounds like you're telling me, Mike, is that from now on we have no choice but to do this piddling pseudo cook so that we can pay back your guys.
#unknown Or else what? Or else they're gonna rat on us, and we end up in prison.
#unknown Yeah? And it sounds like what you're telling me, Walter is that you wanna do this heist even if it means killing a couple of innocent men.
#unknown That what you want? You know, I don't know why you insist on putting words in my mouth here.
#unknown What if we can rip off that train, and no one ever knows it got robbed? Maybe.
#unknown Just maybe.
#unknown It'll come from that direction.
#unknown Seven seventyfive.
#unknown Eight hundred.
#unknown Eight fourteen.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown It's perfect.
#unknown Yeah, we do it here.
#unknown We do it right here.
#unknown How are we looking, Mike? All clear.
#unknown Copy that.
#unknown Go down, go down.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown That's good, Fernando.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown This one.
#unknown Right.
#unknown You good?  Yeah.
#unknown What's your name again?  Todd.
#unknown Todd, on the day, are you gonna be able to make this climb? Yes, sir.
#unknown I'll be ready.
#unknown All right.
#unknown You mind if I ask you a question?  No.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown Well, I get why we want the tank for the methylamine.
#unknown But why this other one for the water? Well Jesse, it's your idea.
#unknown You wanna fill him in? It's all about the weight, yo.
#unknown The tanker we're gonna hit gets weighed when it gets loaded in Long Beach and then again when it's unloaded in Texas.
#unknown If the weights don't match the train company's gonna know it got robbed.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Boosting methylamine from a train is, like, a major rap.
#unknown The point is, no one other than us can ever know that this robbery went down.
#unknown Nobody.
#unknown You got it? Yeah.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Are you sure? Yes, sir.
#unknown With all that said, the whole thing relies on us replacing the weight of methylamine we steal with the same weight in water.
#unknown So they'll never know we hit them.
#unknown Cool.
#unknown Aqueous methylamine is waterbased, yet it weighs slightly less than water.
#unknown We will be removing a thousand gallons of methylamine from the tanker car but replacing it with about ninetenths of that volume in water which comes to 900.
#unknown 24 gallons.
#unknown Actually, Jesse, let's make that an even 920 to account for spillage and whatever will remain in the hose.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown How we doing, by the way?  Eight fifty.
#unknown We're almost there.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Won't they figure they got robbed, getting watereddown methylamine? Well, out of 24,000 gallons it'll only amount to about four percent dilution, so But, yes, you're right.
#unknown They will notice.
#unknown At which point, they will blame China for sending a marginally weaker batch.
#unknown Damn, you guys thought of everything.
#unknown Flynn.
#unknown Flynn, open the door.
#unknown Just come out and talk to me.
#unknown I'm staying.
#unknown That's all I have to say.
#unknown What's going on?  You got what you wanted, that's what.
#unknown Congratulations.
#unknown It's me.
#unknown Open up.
#unknown Come on, Junior.
#unknown I'm not gonna ask twice.
#unknown What? You know what.
#unknown Are you seriously kicking me out of my own house? Are you seriously doing that? We are not kicking you out of anywhere, son.
#unknown We love you.
#unknown And this is your house as much as it is ours.
#unknown But your mom and I need some time alone, and you know that.
#unknown We explained that to you.
#unknown You haven't explained jack shit.
#unknown You want me out? Explain to me why.
#unknown Why do I have to go to Uncle Hank's? Give me the exact reason or I'm not going anywhere.
#unknown This is not gonna be a debate.
#unknown What's going on? Why can't anybody tell me anything? I want one good reason.
#unknown Because we're your parents and you're our child.
#unknown That's reason enough.
#unknown Now, please, do as I ask.
#unknown Now.
#unknown It'll pass.
#unknown He'll understand.
#unknown Don't start, Walt.
#unknown I won't change my mind about you.
#unknown Even Well, I don't accept that.
#unknown You're my wife.
#unknown I'm not your wife, I'm your hostage.
#unknown But since you insist on keeping me imprisoned I'll make you a deal.
#unknown I will launder your money, I'll keep your secrets but the kids will stay at Hank and Marie's where they have a chance of being safe.
#unknown I think you've seen too many movies.
#unknown Our children are not in danger.
#unknown Just a couple of days ago you told me that a man held a gun to your head.
#unknown You said it like it was a point of pride.
#unknown There's nothing you can say that'll convince me there won't come a day that somebody will knock on that door looking to harm you or me or all of us.
#unknown And when that day comes, the children cannot be here.
#unknown You agree to that and I will be whatever kind of partner you want me to be.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown By the way you're visiting a therapist from Rio Rancho.
#unknown Peter.
#unknown Last name is up to you.
#unknown Out burying bodies? Robbing a train.
#unknown Yeah?  It's me.
#unknown I've got it.
#unknown Okay, Mr.
#unknown White, everything's set.
#unknown Hey, Wallace! Up ahead! Stop the train now! S'[Op! Stop the train! Now.
#unknown Go, go, go.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Thank God you guys weren't asleep at the switch.
#unknown It'd be like pancake city out here.
#unknown Man.
#unknown Hey, you believe this? I mean, shit fire and save the matches.
#unknown Talk about bum luck.
#unknown Hey, man, I'm sorry to put you guys out like this.
#unknown What's the trouble with it? No clue.
#unknown I was just driving down the road.
#unknown All of a sudden, the old cow just bellied up and died on me.
#unknown Either one of you guys know about engines? Oh, of course you do.
#unknown That's why they call you an engineer, right?  All right.
#unknown Think it's Think it's in there or something.
#unknown You think?  Yeah.
#unknown Probably a pretty good bet.
#unknown When was the last time you changed the oil? I don't know, man.
#unknown I just drive it.
#unknown Now.
#unknown Go, go, go.
#unknown We're on.
#unknown Good?  Yeah.
#unknown Go! It looks good up here.
#unknown Now, hold up.
#unknown There it is.
#unknown I think this is the one.
#unknown We good?  Yeah.
#unknown Hey, you wanna get in there, give it a whirl? All right, let me give it a try.
#unknown Ready?  Ready.
#unknown Nothing?  Try again.
#unknown Nothing.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Maybe if we all pushed? All right.
#unknown It's worth a try.
#unknown Any other ideas, you just shout them out.
#unknown Not at the moment, I don't.
#unknown You coming? So far, so good.
#unknown Give me a status.
#unknown We're at 300 gallons and counting.
#unknown Water is going Now.
#unknown Water's going in now.
#unknown We're going with water now.
#unknown Good?  Yeah.
#unknown All right.
#unknown One, two, three.
#unknown You did remember to put it in neutral, right? Yeah, man.
#unknown Give me a little credit.
#unknown You sure you're not out of gas? I got a full tank here.
#unknown Yeah, this doesn't make any sense.
#unknown Everything looks good.
#unknown Why don't we just keep going over it? There's gotta be something loose somewhere.
#unknown Damn, buddy.
#unknown Picked a hell of a place to break down.
#unknown I know, right? Crazy.
#unknown Hey, you know anything about engines? Not a whole lot.
#unknown I can push you off the tracks at least.
#unknown Gee, I wouldn't want you to mess up your ride.
#unknown I'll go slow.
#unknown Won't get a scratch.
#unknown You'll screw up your nice shiny bumper.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown We're running late because of you.
#unknown The man said it was no problem.
#unknown Come on already.
#unknown And thank you, by the way.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown Absolutely, pal.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Walter, we've got a Good Samaritan on the scene.
#unknown You pull your guys off that train right now.
#unknown We're not done yet.
#unknown The track is clear, Walter.
#unknown I said get out of there.
#unknown Thank you, mister.
#unknown Much obliged.
#unknown Glad we could work that out for you.
#unknown Yeah, no problem.
#unknown You want a ride into town? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Thanks.
