#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad He was out here with those feds Shouldn't we maybe find out what he told them first? Get out.
#unknown Put the knife down, please.
#unknown Get out!  Ah! Ahh! I need the police.
#unknown My dad You have no right to discuss anything of what I do.
#unknown What the hell do you know about it anyway? Nothing! _ You can come on out.
#unknown It's an actual store.
#unknown Mmhmm.
#unknown I guess I figured Vacuum Cleaner Repair was a term of art.
#unknown If you would step right here on this blue spot.
#unknown Leave your luggage where it is for the moment.
#unknown That good? Sure.
#unknown What about this? I'll Photoshop that out.
#unknown Oh, Nebraska.
#unknown What's in Nebraska? You.
#unknown From now on.
#unknown It's gonna take me some time to get your new situation fixed.
#unknown Until then, you're gonna be staying here.
#unknown I got a place downstairs, out of sight.
#unknown It's not the RitzCarlton, but it's comfortable enough for shortterm.
#unknown How shortterm? Considering you got your face up on buses and billboards all over town, I'm thinking, uh, two days.
#unknown Maybe three.
#unknown Only thing is, and I don't like to do this, but, uh, you'll have a bunk mate.
#unknown Oh, yeah? He's still here? For the moment.
#unknown He's a special case.
#unknown Gonna take some doing.
#unknown How's he holding up? You be the judge.
#unknown We will find Hank.
#unknown Steve too.
#unknown They're out there, and we're gonna find them.
#unknown You have my word.
#unknown Sir.
#unknown Call it in, get her out of here.
#unknown Move.
#unknown I, uh, get to his door, and I could hear music inside.
#unknown Like squeaky voices.
#unknown And I thought, you know, maybe, uh I knocked on his door.
#unknown The music stopped, and then he was right there.
#unknown When he saw the gun, he thought Hey, Kenny.
#unknown Does this pussy cry through the entire thing? Just watch.
#unknown Kept saying that You know, "You don't have to do this.
#unknown " His eyes were so big.
#unknown Such a bitch.
#unknown He won't quit.
#unknown highfiving, because it worked, then, you know, we turn around, and there is this kid on a dirt bike, looking at us.
#unknown Drew Sharp.
#unknown That kid that went missing up in White Horse.
#unknown It's him.
#unknown And then out of nowhere, Todd, that opie, deadeyed piece of shit, pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.
#unknown This is Todd Alquist we're talking about? He killed Drew Sharp? Boom.
#unknown Like it was nothing.
#unknown Hey, Uncle Jack.
#unknown Hold up.
#unknown I think we should keep him for a while, get a couple of cooks under our belt.
#unknown You seriously giving me this turntheothercheek crap? He ratted you out.
#unknown Personally.
#unknown We still got 600 gallons of methylamine.
#unknown Meth? Who gives a shit about meth? We won the lottery here.
#unknown We've got all the money in the world.
#unknown You're talking to me about selling crank? I mean, this is millions, Uncle Jack.
#unknown No matter how much you got, how do you turn your back on more? You little son of a bitch.
#unknown It's that Lydia woman.
#unknown You're sweet on her, you little bastard.
#unknown Hey, Kenny, you believe this? Hey, it's all about this right here, huh? Come on.
#unknown You can do better.
#unknown I mean, that one's so uptight, she's probably got a wood chipper for a coochie.
#unknown You stick it in down there, you're pulling back a stump.
#unknown Ah, what the hell.
#unknown Heart wants what the heart wants, right? Let's go back and watch some more of that crybaby rat, huh? How thick is it? This is mild steel? Uhhuh.
#unknown Uh, no, this would be cash.
#unknown What? Nothing.
#unknown Hey, you know what? Make yourself useful.
#unknown Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries.
#unknown Yes, yes, I remember.
#unknown You've got concerns.
#unknown Don't worry.
#unknown We'll take the time to vet them.
#unknown Make sure there are no undercover cops on the team.
#unknown Five should do it.
#unknown Providing they're the right men for the job.
#unknown I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but, uh, who are we hitting? Jack Welker.
#unknown And his men.
#unknown They murdered Hank.
#unknown They stole my life's work.
#unknown I don't know any hit men.
#unknown You know a guy who knows a guy.
#unknown Just get me the contacts.
#unknown Anybody in that world.
#unknown I'm paying top dollar.
#unknown We'll find them.
#unknown You mind if I give you a nickel's worth of advice? Just for old time's sake? You're worried about your wife and kids? Don't leave.
#unknown The way things are right now, some people, not me, mind you, but some people might say you're leaving her high and dry.
#unknown Some people would be ignorant on the facts.
#unknown Some people wouldn't know that as far as the police are concerned, Skyler is a blameless victim.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown Go ahead.
#unknown Get it off your chest.
#unknown Go on.
#unknown The phone call was a smart move.
#unknown Kudos to you.
#unknown Odds are it was recorded.
#unknown It's gonna play great for a jury.
#unknown It might even buy her a mistrial.
#unknown In a year and a half.
#unknown Until then, if they don't have you, they're going after her.
#unknown There's no point.
#unknown She knows nothing.
#unknown Well, too bad for her, then.
#unknown She's got nothing to trade.
#unknown I hate to be a downer here, but there are two DEA agents missing.
#unknown Presumed dead.
#unknown You think the feds are gonna just let that go 'cause you hit the ejector seat? First thing they're gonna do, they will RICO your wife and kids out of the house.
#unknown That condo is gone.
#unknown Your bank accounts, they're frozen.
#unknown Her picture's probably on TV right now, next to yours.
#unknown Who's gonna hire her? Money's no problem.
#unknown Well, I don't mean to contradict you, but getting it to her, impossible.
#unknown The feds are just praying that you'll make contact.
#unknown Internet, the phone it's all tapped.
#unknown Hey, Mike was no dummy.
#unknown But every time he tried to get his nest egg to his granddaughter, it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.
#unknown So you propose what? Stay.
#unknown Face the music.
#unknown Hey, I mean, how much time have you got left? You walk in with your head held high.
#unknown You'll be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center.
#unknown How bad is that? And you bring a barrel full of drug money, maybe that soothes some troubled waters.
#unknown Maybe they let your family stay in the house.
#unknown After all, the house predates the criminal enterprise.
#unknown God, you think I want to run?! This is the last thing that I want.
#unknown This this changes nothing.
#unknown What I do, I do for my family.
#unknown My money goes to my children.
#unknown Not just this barrel.
#unknown All of it! I'm going to kill Jack and his entire crew, and I'm gonna take back what is mine and give it to my children.
#unknown And then, and only then Am I through.
#unknown Do you understand? Everything good? Define "good.
#unknown " You're set.
#unknown Time to go.
#unknown You'll be a little longer.
#unknown I'm still working on transportation.
#unknown Change of plans.
#unknown He's coming with me.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, that's not We're going together.
#unknown I can use him.
#unknown I'll give you two a minute.
#unknown Hey, I'm a civilian.
#unknown I'm not your lawyer anymore.
#unknown I'm nobody's lawyer.
#unknown The fun's over.
#unknown From here on out, I'm Mr.
#unknown Low Profile.
#unknown Just another douche bag with a job and three pairs of Dockers.
#unknown If I'm lucky, month from now, bestcase scenario, I'm managing a cinnabon in Omaha.
#unknown You're still part of this.
#unknown Whether you like it or not.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I don't think so.
#unknown You remember what I told you? It's not over.
#unknown Unti It's over.
#unknown Is she even listening? Mrs.
#unknown White? Are you following all this? Do you understand what's happening here? Yes.
#unknown I understand.
#unknown I understand I'm in terrible trouble.
#unknown I understand that you will use everything in your power against me and my children unless unless I give you Walt.
#unknown But the truth is, I can't give you what you want.
#unknown I don't know where he is.
#unknown All right, go and discuss this with your lawyer here.
#unknown Rack your brain.
#unknown And hope you can come up with something we can use.
#unknown 417? Ma'am, is there anybody else in the house? What about your son? If I go look in his room, am I gonna see him? He's not gonna pop out and surprise me? If this guy takes his hand away, are you gonna scream? He's at his friend's house.
#unknown He's been there all week.
#unknown Please Please don't hurt my baby.
#unknown Please please.
#unknown Ma'am.
#unknown We we got a lot of respect for your husband.
#unknown There's just something that we gotta straighten out.
#unknown Okay? We know that you've been talking to the police, and that's okay.
#unknown You gotta do that.
#unknown But you've seen some people.
#unknown Like that lady who came into the car wash.
#unknown The one with the black hair.
#unknown You said anything about her? You sure about that? I didn't.
#unknown The police don't need to know anything about her.
#unknown Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna need you to say it.
#unknown I will not say anything about her.
#unknown Ever.
#unknown I swear.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown When we leave, you're not gonna go running to those police officers out front? No.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown 'Cause you really don't want us coming back here.
#unknown Don't.
#unknown Stay where you are.
#unknown We'll talk like this.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So that thing that we talked about, I went to Mr.
#unknown and Mrs.
#unknown White's house You don't have to say the name.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown And it went really good.
#unknown I mean, the message was received loud and clear.
#unknown The message? Yeah.
#unknown Look, I know you did your best.
#unknown I just think Hi.
#unknown What can I get you? Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
#unknown And I'll need more stevia.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown The person we're discussing saw my face.
#unknown You're not Western Union, Todd.
#unknown We can't just settle for you sending messages.
#unknown Really, if you'd been there, I think you'd see it different.
#unknown We threw a real scare into her.
#unknown She seems like a nice lady watching out for her kids.
#unknown So You're not going to have a problem with her.
#unknown I can pretty much guarantee it.
#unknown I wish I had your certainty, but I'm not like you and your uncle.
#unknown I'm just I'm not used to this kind of risk.
#unknown We're gonna have to take a break.
#unknown I I have 50 pounds vacuum packed and ready to go.
#unknown And I wish you all the luck in the world with it.
#unknown It's 92%.
#unknown I'm sorry? Truly? Tested it twice.
#unknown And it's blue.
#unknown Just like before.
#unknown That's Heisenberg level.
#unknown He's not with you? Well, next best thing.
#unknown Pinkman.
#unknown They're looking for Pinkman.
#unknown Well, they're not going to find him.
#unknown He's with us, and he's not going anywhere.
#unknown Ms.
#unknown Quayle, this is what your guys in Europe have been begging for, right? I just think we work together good.
#unknown We make a good team.
#unknown I think it's kind of mutually good.
#unknown Ugh.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Lambert, welcome to New Hampshire.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Let's have a look at this place.
#unknown You got about a month's worth of food on hand, most of it's canned goods, but there's steaks in the freezer.
#unknown You got a generator outside, works on LP.
#unknown Ought to be enough in the tank to last out the winter.
#unknown It's only 15 amps, but that ought to do for the lights, TV, and the freezer.
#unknown That's a woodburner.
#unknown Ought to warm the place up pretty good.
#unknown Plus you can cook on it.
#unknown On the TV front, the reception's pretty much nil.
#unknown You got some mountains in the way.
#unknown Weather's right, you might be able to catch Montreal, but mostly you'll be limited to DVDs.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Magorium's Wonder Emporium.
#unknown Two copies.
#unknown I'm not much of a movie guy.
#unknown I'll make a supply run next month.
#unknown You want something else to watch, put it on the list.
#unknown Supply run.
#unknown $50,000 for a trip to Costco.
#unknown It's risk.
#unknown And risk is what you're paying me for, not toilet paper.
#unknown Risk and a 4,400mile round trip.
#unknown Mr.
#unknown Lambert, my clients and I don't usually have an ongoing relationship.
#unknown Normally, you and I would have already gone our separate ways, but you're you.
#unknown Where's the phone? No phone.
#unknown Up here, ice storms equal service calls, equal you in cuffs.
#unknown Internet? Same deal.
#unknown Also satellite, cable TV, drop phone, car.
#unknown You want news, I'll bring the Albuquerque papers.
#unknown Whatever you need, just  put it on the list.
#unknown Put it on the list.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Look, I have business to conduct.
#unknown Your business is your business.
#unknown My business is keeping you out of custody.
#unknown You are the target of a nationwide manhunt.
#unknown Your face is all over TV.
#unknown You are the hottest client I have ever had.
#unknown By far.
#unknown It stands to reason you've got to keep out of sight.
#unknown And what's keeping me from walking out that gate? Nothing.
#unknown There's a little onehorse town eight miles down the hill.
#unknown There's not a thing on God's green Earth that I can do to stop you going down there.
#unknown All I'm saying is, if you leave this place, you will get caught.
#unknown And, I gotta tell you, if I find out that you've left the reservation, I won't be coming back.
#unknown That is for my own safety.
#unknown You understand? Sure.
#unknown You know how to work the stove?  The flue can be tricky.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I got it.
#unknown You paid good money for this.
#unknown You got two acres up here, lots of woods, nice, warm place.
#unknown Seems to me just the spot for a man to rest up, think on things.
#unknown If you look around, it's kinda beautiful.
#unknown You've been very helpful.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown See you in a month.
#unknown Tomorrow.
#unknown Tomorrow.

#unknown " I didn't know what you liked, so I got you some of each.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown So that batch that you just cooked was 96%.
#unknown Kinda figured you deserved a little something.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Well, better get some sleep.
#unknown Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.
#unknown Got a whole new batch.
#unknown Hey, um, Todd.
#unknown Yeah? Would you mind, uh, leaving the tarp off tonight? Well, might get cold.

#unknown How is Jesse? Is he okay? Yeah, he's okay.
#unknown Actually, I brought him with me.

#unknown Maybe put a little weight on you.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown I can barely read this.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown Almost forgot.
#unknown Without a prescription, I had to take an educated guess and shotgun it.
#unknown One of these ought to come close.
#unknown Oh.
#unknown Did you, uh, check on them? Is Skyler in a better place? Nah, she's still at that place off of Eubank.
#unknown Kids are both still with her for the moment.
#unknown Uh, there's no court date yet.
#unknown The news was talking about a grand jury, but they didn't say when.
#unknown I saw her public defender on TV.
#unknown Looks like a deer in the headlights.
#unknown Think I got socks older than him.
#unknown What are they doing for money? She's doing taxi dispatch parttime.
#unknown Leaves the baby with a neighbor when she goes in.
#unknown I saw her shopping one time.
#unknown She looks pretty good.
#unknown And she's using her maiden name.
#unknown I wouldn't take that personally under the circumstances.
#unknown Those working for you? Oh, yeah.
#unknown I took a run by your old house.
#unknown Uh, the auction's still pending.
#unknown They put a fence up around it.
#unknown They put up a fence? Seems like the place got to be kind of a tourist attraction.

#unknown About $100,000.

#unknown DEA.
#unknown Albuquerque District Office.
#unknown How may I direct your call? I'd like to speak to the agent in charge of the Walter White investigation.
#unknown Who may I say is calling?  Walter White.
#unknown Hello? Hello? Sir? Sir, are you still there? You ready for that drink now? Dimple Pinch.
#unknown Neat.
#unknown You got it.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown For us, it's always been science first, and Wait.
#unknown Would you would you would you go back, please? more of a byproduct.
#unknown There.
#unknown Exactly.
#unknown What, this? Yes.
#unknown But just yesterday, your charity, the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz Foundation, announced a $28 million grant for drug abuse treatment centers throughout the Southwest.
#unknown Charlie, the Southwest is our home, and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.
#unknown But I'm sure you're aware that there are people who suggest other motives.
#unknown Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to sure up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies because of your association with Walter White.
#unknown Well, that's not exactly the way To cleanse yourselves, so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin as cofounder of your company.
#unknown Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up.
#unknown I have to believe that the investing public understands we're talking about a person who who was there early on, but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company, and still less to do with growing it into what it is today.
#unknown So what was Walter White's contribution? You know, to be honest Honey?  The company name.
#unknown The company name.
#unknown We came up with it by combining our names.
#unknown Uh, "Schwartz" means black, black plus White makes gray.
#unknown It's Gray Matter Technologies.
#unknown Exactly.
#unknown As far as I can recall, his contribution begins and ends right there.
#unknown There are continuing reports of blue methamphetamine, considered his signature product throughout the Southwest, and some evidence of reaching as far as Europe.
#unknown So my question is, is Walter White still out there? No, he's not.
#unknown You sound very sure.
#unknown I am.
#unknown I can't speak to this Heisenberg that people refer to, but whatever whatever he became, the the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once knew, long ago, he's gone.
#unknown But to be absolutely clear Police.
#unknown Hands.
#unknown Show us your hands.
#unknown Show me your hands.
#unknown Chemistry is the study of transformation.
#unknown What the hell is wrong with you?! We're a family! _ _ _ _ If you leave this place, you will get caught.
#unknown _ _ Why are you still alive? Go ahead! Do it! _ Please, don't hurt my baby.
#unknown It's over.
#unknown I've still got things left to do.
#unknown Breaking Bad.
