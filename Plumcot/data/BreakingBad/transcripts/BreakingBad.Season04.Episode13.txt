#unknown What did you say to Gus?  Because he's on to us.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown What do you mean he's on to us? He's walking to his car, then suddenly he isn't.
#unknown What, does he have a sixth sense? Jesus.
#unknown What did you say to him? Could I ask my own question right now at this point? Did you just bring a bomb into a hospital? What, was I supposed to leave it on his car? What, you're supposed to bring it to a hospital? Oh, my God.
#unknown Look.
#unknown Where can we find Gus? Name a place.
#unknown One place where I can surprise him where he won't see me coming.
#unknown Because his house, the laundry the restaurant, factory farm, all wired with cameras.
#unknown One place.
#unknown Think.
#unknown Jesse, think.
#unknown Where is it? Where? Because if you can't tell me we are dead.
#unknown Jesse? I don't I don't know.
#unknown Well, maybe Excuse me.
#unknown Jesse Pinkman?  Yeah.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Detective Kalanchoe.
#unknown Detective Munn, Albuquerque Police.
#unknown We were wondering if we could have a few minutes.
#unknown Go someplace and talk.
#unknown About what?  Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
#unknown About what? It concerns Brock Cantillo and a statement you made to his mother.
#unknown How about you come with us? We just wanna clear a few things up, no big deal.
#unknown So am I under arrest?  No, you're not under arrest.
#unknown We're just talking.
#unknown So if I get tired of talking, can I get up and leave? We'd prefer you didn't.
#unknown You'd prefer.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom that the boy had been poisoned? Look, I think this has been, you know "Have the doctors thought maybe Brock got poisoned?" In a coverallbases kind of sense.
#unknown Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that.
#unknown You helping them out like that.
#unknown Especially how specific you were.
#unknown Ricin, wow.
#unknown Ricin, that's definitely a big one.
#unknown You don't see that every day.
#unknown So when doctors hear that, they take it very seriously.
#unknown As do we.
#unknown As does the FBI.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Nice, you trying to help out like that and all.
#unknown You know, professional courtesy, sharing your expertise.
#unknown Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right? I just, you know You happened to guess this rare poison might be the thing that put this boy in the hospital.
#unknown Congratulations.
#unknown Because his doctors, they think that you might just be right.
#unknown So why ricin? Jesse, how'd you come up with that? I think I've I don't know, I must've saw it on House or something.
#unknown Yeah, you know, like, House or the Discovery Channel.
#unknown Sometimes your brain just makes these connections.
#unknown Does it?  Mine does.
#unknown That's interesting.
#unknown Look, I gotta get back.
#unknown But we're still talking.
#unknown So I'm not under arrest, but I can't leave.
#unknown So then, I guess I should call my lawyer, right? We're just having a simple conversation, Jess.
#unknown Why can't we keep talking, keep it light? You know how it is when the lawyers get to it.
#unknown Suddenly, everything's a big pissing match.
#unknown Like, every time.
#unknown Adversarial.
#unknown Adversarial.
#unknown Then we gotta book you.
#unknown Right? I mean, you know.
#unknown You've been around the block, Jesse.
#unknown You're no Boy Scout.
#unknown Saul Goodman.
#unknown That's my guy.
#unknown So do I gotta call him or do you? What the hell are you doing?  I need Saul.
#unknown Right now.
#unknown So you break in?  You just break in.
#unknown I see you're here.
#unknown If you'd answer the phone or the door, maybe I wouldn't Forget it.
#unknown Is he here? Is that a serious question? Why would he be here? But you know where he is.
#unknown I need a number.
#unknown Look, let me explain something to you.
#unknown My partner and I  Are in danger? Whooptyfreakingdoo.
#unknown Why do you think he's not here? And how's that news, exactly, the two of you being in danger? After doing something idiotic? What gives you the right to break down my door? Look, I just need a number, okay? That's all.
#unknown You are such a pain in my ass, you know that? You're the reason I gotta go on unemployment.
#unknown I was looking forward to getting out of here.
#unknown But, no, now I gotta wait around all day for a guy to come fix this door.
#unknown Who pays for this? Okay, you know what? Here, look, I'm giving you everything.
#unknown All of it, okay? There's one, two  Look, there's gotta be at least More than cover the cost of the door.

#unknown A door like this is gonna cost way more than 1700.
#unknown What, for a plate of glass? No.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown I bet it does.
#unknown I bet you it winds up costing 20,000.
#unknown Are you insane? Who the hell is going to charge $20,000 for a plateglass door? There's no reputable vendor would Now I'm thinking 25.
#unknown I'll be right back.
#unknown Yes.

#unknown Jesse, if you care at all about that little boy prove it to me.
#unknown Tell us what you know.
#unknown I told you what I know.
#unknown Tell us again.
#unknown What are you, like, broken records? I was trying to be helpful.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown Guess we'll wait and see what the tox screen says.
#unknown Look at this.
#unknown isn't this cosy? What'd you tell them? I told them they're a couple of dicks.
#unknown He's a wordsmith.
#unknown Well, detectives, it's been a pleasure.
#unknown Now, up you go make like you got manners, make like you respect the rule of law.
#unknown Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen, hasta luego, get the hell out.
#unknown Byebye.
#unknown That's it, pick it up.

#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Christ.
#unknown You two? If I ever get anal polyps, I'll know what to name them.
#unknown Are you gonna get me out of here? No.
#unknown Not even if I could.
#unknown You know, the FBI's gonna show up on this ricin thing and then you're in it for the duration.
#unknown You're a lot safer in here.
#unknown They tried to get your partner in his own home.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Is he okay? Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.
#unknown Now, we're all on the clock here and thanks for that.
#unknown Wanna go stick your wangs in a hornet's nest it's a free country.
#unknown But how come I always get sloppy seconds, huh? You got anything for me? Tell me I didn't poke my head up for nothing.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I've been thinking  And? Casa Tranquila.
#unknown What's Casa Tranquila? It's an old folks' home off Paseo Del Norte.
#unknown Our boy tells me Fring took him to visit one of the patients.
#unknown Someone Pinkman says you'll definitely remember: Tio Salamanca.
#unknown Old guy in a wheelchair? Doesn't talk, rings a bell.
#unknown I mean, does that ring a bell?  The guy actually has to ring a bell.
#unknown Yes, I know.
#unknown I remember.
#unknown So, what, once every blue moon Gus goes and visits an old cartel associate.
#unknown That doesn't help me.
#unknown I can't hide out in a nursing home for six months hoping on the off chance that he comes back.
#unknown It's not even like they're friends.
#unknown Pinkman said it was like he was torturing the old guy.
#unknown What does that mean? He told him the last of his family was dead.
#unknown He enjoyed telling him.
#unknown Pinkman asked him about it.
#unknown All Gus would say was that this Tio character murdered someone close to him.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown Tio murdered someone close to Gus? I know, it sounds not particularly fruitful.
#unknown But, sorry, that's all I got.
#unknown They're enemies, not friends.
#unknown Next number in this coverall game where you cover the whole shimoly is B number three, like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
#unknown That's number three in your B column.
#unknown Followed by O, seven, four that's O, 74, on the other side of your card.
#unknown Now we have that lucky number B, number seven.
#unknown Is it lucky for you? B, seven.
#unknown In the I row, two, one.
#unknown I, 21.
#unknown I know you despise me.
#unknown And I know how badly you wanna see me dead.
#unknown But I'm willing to bet that I know a man whom you hate even more.
#unknown Those N's just keep coming.
#unknown They're all sticking together.
#unknown I'm offering you an opportunity for revenge.
#unknown G column, four, eight the continental United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I'm here.
#unknown How you doing this morning, Mr.
#unknown Salamanca? You need something? You need to go poopie, huh? Did you go poopie already? No? What do you need? You want me to get the board for you? Okay.

#unknown Help me out here.
#unknown Hey, son, what's up?  When exactly are you getting here? Just as soon as I can.
#unknown Look, this is a serious situation and you're not taking it seriously.
#unknown Let me talk to him.
#unknown Son, I am taking this seriously.
#unknown Give it to me, Walter.
#unknown I'm concerned about your Uncle Hank and his safety.
#unknown But whomever is making these threats against him I can assure you, there's absolutely no interest in me.
#unknown I'm not on anyone's radar.
#unknown And besides, your mother and I  Give it to me.
#unknown Walter.
#unknown Did you hear what he said? Get over here.
#unknown No more excuses.
#unknown Marie, I will be there just as soon as I can.
#unknown I promise.
#unknown Hold on.
#unknown You wanna weigh in here? Maybe you can talk sense into him? Marie, he'll get here when he gets here so  I hope you sell plenty of air fresheners.
#unknown I hope you have a banner day over there.
#unknown Okay, Walt, don't worry about a thing here.
#unknown Goodbye.
#unknown And thank you for all of your help.
#unknown What's that? Anything?  Hey, everyone.
#unknown Hi, Steve.
#unknown How's everybody holding out?  The man I wanna see.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Look at this.
#unknown Jesus, enough with the laundry.
#unknown No, no, no, hear me out.
#unknown This panel, if I'm reading it correctly, is 7200 amp service.
#unknown This place has two of them, right? That's a whole lot of juice, brother.
#unknown Laundry this size, typically, has half that, okay? What's with the extra panel?  What are you, Thomas Edison?  Asked a bunch of electricians.
#unknown They have their own chat rooms, all they talked about was wiring.
#unknown Freaking Internet.
#unknown Find anything on it these days.
#unknown What do you say? Pop over, have another looksee? Listen.
#unknown I think we possibly have a lead on something.
#unknown Yeah?  I have this guy down at the office.
#unknown He says he has some kind of information.
#unknown The thing is, he'll only give it to you, in person.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Do you remember Hector Salamanca?  Yeah.
#unknown The old cripple guy with the bell? Rather crap than talk to us?  No, I don't remember him at all.
#unknown Why?  Well, he's the guy.
#unknown His nurse calls us, says he wants to powwow.
#unknown So we have this guy at the office for three hours.
#unknown And he still just wants to talk to you.
#unknown Do not even think about going down there.
#unknown Marie  This is clearly a ploy or a trick or something designed to get Hank out into the open.
#unknown That's all this is.
#unknown Well, that's what we thought.
#unknown Well  it's been years since this guy's been a player.
#unknown His nephew's gone, doesn't have anybody.
#unknown The nurse checks out, don't know nothing.
#unknown Guess I just don't see an angle here if there even is one.
#unknown Of course, if you did wanna talk to this guy there's no safer place than the office.
#unknown I don't think this sounds like a good idea.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I agree, Uncle Hank.
#unknown It is a ridiculous idea.
#unknown And there's no way that you're going to do it.
#unknown End of story.
#unknown Hank, thanks for coming down.
#unknown No problem at all.
#unknown Good to see you, sir.

#unknown Well, at least this time, he didn't shit himself.
#unknown I guess that's progress.
#unknown Yes?  We may have a problem.
#unknown I've got eyes on the DEA.
#unknown They just had a visitor.
#unknown Hector Salamanca.
#unknown I don't know what to say to you now.
#unknown Sit here and think about how far that kind of behaviour is gonna get you.
#unknown Not far, let me tell you.
#unknown Any second thoughts? Then let's get to work.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown Hi.

#unknown It's all clear.
#unknown Wait here.
#unknown What kind of man talks to the DEA? No man.
#unknown No man at all.

#unknown Oh, thank God.
#unknown Oh, thank God.
#unknown You know, still saying it wasn't the ricin.
#unknown I don't understand.
#unknown Then what was it? Saying it was most likely a flower called lily of the valley.
#unknown It's, like, common.
#unknown It's got these red berries on it that I guess taste sweet and sometimes kids eat them and wind up poisoning themselves.
#unknown And that's it, nothing more.
#unknown So Gus didn't poison him after all.
#unknown Still he had to go right? Damn right.
#unknown Gus had to go.
#unknown Yeah.
