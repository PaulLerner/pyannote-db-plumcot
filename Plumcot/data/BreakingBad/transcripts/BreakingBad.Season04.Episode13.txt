jesse_pinkman  Did you just bring a bomb into a hospital?
walter_white  What, was I supposed to leave it on his car?
jesse_pinkman  What, you're supposed to bring it to a
jesse_pinkman  my God.
walter_white  Where can we find Gus?
walter_white  Name a place.
walter_white  One place where I can surprise him where he won't see me coming.
walter_white  Because his house, the laundry the restaurant, factory farm, all wired with cameras.

kalanchoe  We're just talking.
jesse_pinkman  if I get tired of talking, can I get up and leave?
kalanchoe  We'd prefer you didn't.
jesse_pinkman  You'd prefer.
kalanchoe  Yeah.
munn  Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom that the boy had been poisoned?
jesse_pinkman  Look, I think this has been, you know" Have
jesse_pinkman  Have the
jesse_pinkman  the doctors thought maybe Brock got poisoned?"
jesse_pinkman  In a coverallbases kind of sense.
kalanchoe  Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that.
kalanchoe  You helping them out like that.
kalanchoe  Especially how specific you were.
munn  Ricin, wow.
kalanchoe  Ricin, that's definitely a big one.
kalanchoe  You don't see that every day.
kalanchoe  So when doctors hear that, they take it very seriously.
kalanchoe  As do we.
kalanchoe  As does the FBI.
munn  Okay. Nice, you trying to help out like that and all.
munn  You know, professional courtesy, sharing your expertise.
jesse_pinkman  Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right?
jesse_pinkman  I just, you know You
kalanchoe  You happened to guess this rare poison might be the thing that put this boy in the hospital.
kalanchoe  Congratulations.
kalanchoe  Because his doctors, they think that you might just be right.
kalanchoe  So why ricin?
kalanchoe  Jesse, how'd you come up with that?
jesse_pinkman  I think I've I don't know, I must've saw it on House or something.
jesse_pinkman  you know, like, House or the Discovery Channel.
jesse_pinkman  Sometimes your brain just makes these connections.
kalanchoe  Does it

kalanchoe  That's interesting.
jesse_pinkman  Look, I gotta get back.
munn  But we're still talking.
jesse_pinkman  I'm not under arrest, but I can't leave.
jesse_pinkman  then, I guess I should call my lawyer, right?
kalanchoe  We're just having a simple conversation, Jess.
kalanchoe  Why can't we keep talking, keep it light?
munn  You know how it is when the lawyers get to it.
munn  Suddenly, everything's a big pissing match.
munn  Like, every time.
kalanchoe  Adversarial.
munn  Adversarial. Then
munn  Then we gotta book you.
munn  Right?
munn  I mean, you know.
munn  You've been around the block, Jesse.
munn  You're no Boy Scout.

saul_goodman  Someone Pinkman says you'll definitely remember :
saul_goodman  Tio Salamanca.
saul_goodman  Old guy in a wheelchair?
saul_goodman  Doesn't talk, rings a bell.
saul_goodman  I mean, does that ring a bell?
saul_goodman  The guy actually has to ring a bell. Yes
walter_white  Yes, I know.
walter_white  I remember.
walter_white  So, what, once every blue moon Gus goes and visits an old cartel associate.
walter_white  That doesn't help me.
walter_white  I can't hide out in a nursing home for six months hoping on the off chance that he comes back.
saul_goodman  not even like they're friends.
saul_goodman  Pinkman said it was like he was torturing the old guy.
walter_white  What does that mean?
saul_goodman  He told him the last of his family was dead.
saul_goodman  He enjoyed telling him
saul_goodman  Pinkman asked him about it
saul_goodman  All Gus would say was that this Tio character murdered someone close to him.
walter_white  Tio murdered someone close to Gus?
saul_goodman  I know, it sounds not particularly fruitful. But
saul_goodman  But, sorry, that's all I got.
walter_white  They're

steven_gomez  Anything?
steven_gomez  everyone.
skyler_white  Hi, Steve.
steven_gomez  How's everybody holding out
hank_schrader  out? The man I wanna see. Come here.
hank_schrader  Look
hank_schrader  Look at this.
steven_gomez  Jesus, enough with the laundry.
hank_schrader  No, no, no, hear me out.
hank_schrader  This panel, if I'm reading it correctly, is 7200 amp service.
steven_gomez  This place has two of them
steven_gomez  them, right? That's a whole lot of juice, brother.
hank_schrader  Laundry this size, typically, has half that, okay?
hank_schrader  What's with the extra panel?
steven_gomez  What are you, Thomas Edison?
hank_schrader  Asked a bunch of electricians.
hank_schrader  They have their own chat rooms, all they talked about was wiring.
hank_schrader  Freaking Internet.
hank_schrader  Find anything on it these days.
hank_schrader  What do you say?
hank_schrader  Pop over, have another looksee?
steven_gomez  I
steven_gomez  we possibly have a lead on something.
hank_schrader  Yeah?
steven_gomez  have this guy down at the office.
steven_gomez  He says he has some kind of information.
steven_gomez  The thing is, he'll only give it to you, in person.
steven_gomez  remember Hector Salamanca?
hank_schrader  Yeah. The old cripple guy with the bell?
hank_schrader  Rather crap than talk to us?
hank_schrader  No, I don't remember him at all.
hank_schrader  Why?
steven_gomez  Well, he's the guy. His
steven_gomez  nurse calls us, says he wants to powwow.
steven_gomez  So we have this guy at the office for three hours. And
steven_gomez  And he still just wants to talk to you.
marie_schrader  not even think about going down there.
hank_schrader  Marie This
marie_schrader  This is clearly a ploy or a trick or something designed to get Hank out into the open.
marie_schrader  That's all this is
steven_gomez  Well, that's what we thought.
steven_gomez  it's been years since this guy's been a player.
steven_gomez  His nephew's gone, doesn't have anybody.
steven_gomez  The nurse checks out, don't know nothing.
steven_gomez  Guess I just don't see an angle here if there even is one.
steven_gomez  Of course, if you did wanna talk to this guy there's no safer place than the office.
skyler_white  I don't think this sounds like a good idea. Yeah
walter_white_jr.  Yeah. I
walter_white_jr.  I agree, Uncle Hank.
marie_schrader  It is a ridiculous idea.
marie_schrader  And there's no way that you're going to do it.

walter_white  understand. Then what was it?
jesse_pinkman  Saying it was most likely a flower called lily of the valley.
jesse_pinkman  It's, like, common.
jesse_pinkman  It's got these red berries on it that I guess taste sweet and sometimes kids eat them and wind up poisoning themselves.
jesse_pinkman  And that's it, nothing more.
jesse_pinkman  So Gus didn't poison him after all
jesse_pinkman  Still he had to go right?
walter_white  Damn right.
walter_white  Gus had to go.
