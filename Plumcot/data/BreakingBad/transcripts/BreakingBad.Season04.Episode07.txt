saul_goodman  The only thing is, it's not gonna be free.
saul_goodman  There's a 5 grand fine, another 3 grand to steam clean the blacktop.
saul_goodman  So bottom line, your little joyride's gonna set you back about 52,000 bucks,
saul_goodman  so was it worth it?
walter_white  I don't need to hear the blowbyblow. Just
walter_white  Just tell me it's done.
saul_goodman  I'm sorry,
saul_goodman  did I wake you?
saul_goodman  I caught this thing before it got into the system. That
saul_goodman  That means your record stays clean. The wife never finds out
saul_goodman  out. I've been working magic here.
saul_goodman  I can at least get an" attaboy.
saul_goodman  Fine.
saul_goodman  Rebel without a cause, give.
saul_goodman  What is it
saul_goodman  Fring?
walter_white  He will see me dead
walter_white  and there's nothing I can do about it
walter_white  All that's left is to wait.
saul_goodman  And we're sure about this.
saul_goodman 'Cause Pinkman ss he needs you too much.
walter_white  Pinkman says.
walter_white  groans" Pinkman says." Unless you could help me find a third party.
saul_goodman  What third party?
walter_white  Someone who can ameliorate the situation.
saul_goodman  Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right?
saul_goodman  You talking about a hit man?
walter_white  Assuming that's still what they're called.
saul_goodman  Wrong answer!
saul_goodman  That's what the kids call" epic fail.
walter_white  All I would need is a phone number.
walter_white  I would do the rest.
walter_white  Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.
walter_white  A big one.
saul_goodman  Look, if you held my feet to the fire, I could come up with a couple names One
saul_goodman  One or two guys west of the Rockies who do this kind of work But
saul_goodman  But guess what.
saul_goodman  These guys?
saul_goodman  They know Mike. And Mike knows them.
walter_white  What are you telling me? Mike knows everyone who does this?
saul_goodman  Who do you think gave me their names?
saul_goodman  Okay
saul_goodman  Okay, Plan B.
saul_goodman  Look, we go outside my network
saul_goodman  Craigslist,
saul_goodman  Soldier of Fortune.
saul_goodman  Let's say we get lucky,
saul_goodman  I mean, incredibly lucky, and find a guy who's not an undercover cop or some kind of survivalist nutjob wannabe.
saul_goodman  You gotta ask yourself How good is good enough?
saul_goodman  Because whatever goomba we buy at some point is gonna come headtohead with our friend Mike.
saul_goodman  And Gus Fring?
saul_goodman  Just winging that guy is not gonna ameliorate your situation, not
saul_goodman  not by a damn sight.
walter_white  I tried to, but I can't get anywhere near him
saul_goodman  You can't get near him?
saul_goodman  Why don't you ask your partner?
walter_white  you tell Saul before you tell me?
jesse_pinkman  he's my lawyer, same as yours.
jesse_pinkman  Every time I go over there, Saul hassles me about Mike.
jesse_pinkman  He's still scared the dude's gonna come break his legs.
jesse_pinkman  So I give him the latest.
walter_white  But what happened
jesse_pinkman  I was at a diner with Mike, and he just shows up.
jesse_pinkman  They send me outside and the two of them talk.
jesse_pinkman  That's
walter_white  So this is, like, a regular thing?
walter_white  How close were you to him?
jesse_pinkman  Close.
jesse_pinkman  Closer than you and me right now.
walter_white  Did he speak to you?
jesse_pinkman  It was over in 10 seconds. Would
walter_white  Would you just answer?
jesse_pinkman  He said he sees things in people.
walter_white  What things?
walter_white  What people?
jesse_pinkman  Me.
jesse_pinkman  said he sees something in me.
walter_white  month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us,
walter_white  and now he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as what,
walter_white  an assistant gunman?
walter_white  A tough
walter_white  Does that make any sense to you?
walter_white  He says he sees something in you.
walter_white  What kind of game is he
walter_white  playing? Does he think you're that naive?
walter_white  He can't truly think that you'd forget
walter_white  let alone Gale, let alone Victor, and all the horror that goes along with all of that.
walter_white  What about this girlfriend of yours and her little brother?
walter_white  The man looked you straight in the eye and told you" no more children,"
walter_white  but that very night, that little boy he
walter_white  he winds
walter_white  possibly think that you'd forget that.
jesse_pinkman  I
walter_white  I mean, all I'm saying is that is it possible he would think that you're that weakwilled?
jesse_pinkman  Drop the sales pitch.
jesse_pinkman  I'll do it.
walter_white  You'll do what?
jesse_pinkman  him first chance I get.

skyler_white  But you know what they say The
skyler_white  The customer's always right.
marie_schrader  Speaking of customer, it's not too late to have a grand opening.
marie_schrader  I was thinking huge party, balloons, bouncy house for the kids, you know, make a splash, get on TV.

walter_white  How much is that? $274,000. Give or take. Give or take
skyler_white  take? Yeah
walter_white  Yeah.
walter_white  I haven't counted
skyler_white  it.

walter_white  Every two weeks.
walter_white  Thursday's good for a dropoff? Wait
skyler_white  Walt. Are you telling me you make $7,125,000 a year?
walter_white  before expenses.
skyler_white  But I can't
skyler_white  This is too much.
walter_white  So it's more than you thought, and this is somehow bad news?
skyler_white  No, that's not the point.
skyler_white  I mean, there is no car wash in the world that could do this kind of business.
skyler_white  I mean, this is 9 month's work here minimum.
skyler_white  could take years.
walter_white  So set some aside.
walter_white  Save it for a rainy day.
skyler_white  Save it
skyler_white  Save it where?
skyler_white  I can't go to the bank with it. I
skyler_white  I sure can't leave it here.
skyler_white  Wait a minute.
skyler_white  Is this all 50s?
skyler_white  Who pays for a car wash with a 50? Skyler
walter_white  Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.
walter_white  I was under the impression that you had this under control.
skyler_white  I just didn't expect this amount of money.
skyler_white  50s are gonna be a problem.
walter_white  Well, that's what this is Problem solving.
walter_white  Skyler, this is a simple division of labor.
walter_white  I bring in the money,
walter_white  you launder the money.
walter_white  This is what you wanted.
skyler_white  I never wanted any of this.
walter_white  I've got to go.
walter_white  If you want out, just say that you want out.
jesse_pinkman  switch clicks whirring whirring whirring You're telling me you made this in the lab?
walter_white  Why not?
walter_white  Making it in his own lab seemed appropriate.
jesse_pinkman  There's not much of it.
jesse_pinkman  We had more for Tuco.
walter_white  It's enough.
walter_white  This is still the best way.
walter_white  You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive.
walter_white  But with this,
walter_white  you slip it into his food or drink,
walter_white  there shouldn't be any taste or smell,
walter_white  A man his age, working as hard as he does, no one will be surprised.
walter_white  Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be.
walter_white  Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.
jesse_pinkman  when I'm gonna see Gus again
jesse_pinkman  I mean, if ever.
walter_white  Keep it with you.
walter_white  When you have the opportunity, be ready.
jesse_pinkman  What if they search me?
walter_white  Will they do that?
walter_white  It's the wrong way around

hank_schrader  What do you mean, on a lark?
hank_schrader  Spur of the moment, your dad just ups and buys you a brandnew Challenger?
walter_white_jr.  Yeah, I barely got around the block and Mom said we couldn't afford it, so they took it back.
walter_white_jr.  you know how long I had it
walter_white_jr.  hours.
hank_schrader  Well, hey, buddy, let me tell you
hank_schrader  When I was your age, I'd have given my left nut to drive a car like that for 15 minutes.
hank_schrader  But seriously, how does that happen?

hank_schrader  pulled the old" Poor little me and my little troubles." Am I right?
walter_white_jr.  Maybe.
hank_schrader  well, you flew too close to the sun, my friend.
hank_schrader  You'd have let him buy you a clunker you'd be driving now, instead of borrowing Mom's hooptie.

group_leader  Jesse?
group_leader  Long time, no see.
group_leader  you doing? Yeah,
jesse_pinkman  you know, uh good. Good.
group_leader  Good.
group_leader  Okay, we're going to get started.
group_leader  You coming in?
group_leader  So the truth is we can't change the past. What's done is done.
group_leader  We've got to own our actions, but putting ourselves on trial, acting as our own judge, jury, and executioner, it's not the answer because
group_leader  because a lot of the time all that judging does is just ensure that we're going to repeat the cycle.
group_leader  Right.
group_leader  I'm such an asshhole.
group_leader " It's totally hopeless."" What's the point?"
group_leader  I think I'll have a hit.
group_leader  Jesse. What's going on with you these days?
jesse_pinkman  sigh I went back to the crystal.
group_leader  You sober now?
jesse_pinkman  Four days.
jesse_pinkman  Big whoop, right?
group_leader  Four days is four days.
group_leader  You're here.
group_leader  You still working at the laundry?
group_leader  How are things there.
jesse_pinkman  Sucks ass.
group_leader  chuckling Anything you want to talk about
jesse_pinkman  a couple of weeks back I, uh killed a dog.
group_leader  You hit it with your car?
jesse_pinkman  No,
jesse_pinkman  I put him down.
jesse_pinkman  I watched him go.
jesse_pinkman  I was looking him straight in the eye
jesse_pinkman  you know, he didn't know what was happening.
jesse_pinkman  He didn't know why.
jesse_pinkman  He was just scared,
jesse_pinkman  and then he was gone.
colleen  He was suffering.
colleen  It was a
jesse_pinkman  kindness. No, he wasn't
jesse_pinkman  sick. No, he was just
jesse_pinkman  I don't know, like a problem
colleen  did he do?
colleen  Bite someone?
jesse_pinkman  Uh, this dog never
jesse_pinkman  never bit anybody.
support_group_member  You pick up the rock, you go right to the dark side.
support_group_member  Anything can happen.
jesse_pinkman  It ain't no rock that made me do it.
colleen  Well, what was the problem?
colleen  Why did you have to kill him?
group_leader  Watch the crosstalk, please.
group_leader  Maybe it's not the details that matter.
group_leader  How'd you feel about what you did, Jesse?
jesse_pinkman  know.
colleen  Who cares how you feel?
colleen  kind of a person kills a dog for no reason?
group_leader  Colleen.
colleen  You put an ad in the paper. You drop him off at a shelter. Colleen You
colleen  You just don't sit there and talk about killing a helpless Colleen. innocent animal.
group_leader  not here to sit in judgment.
jesse_pinkman  Why not?
jesse_pinkman  Why not?
jesse_pinkman  Maybe Maybe she's right.
jesse_pinkman  You know, maybe I should have put it in the paper.
jesse_pinkman  Maybe I should have done something different.
jesse_pinkman  thing is, if you just do stuff and nothing happens what's it all mean?
jesse_pinkman  What's the point?
jesse_pinkman  All right, this whole thing is about selfacceptance.
group_leader  Kicking the hell out of yourself doesn't give meaning to anything.
jesse_pinkman  So I should stop judging and accept Man
group_leader  Man It's a start.
jesse_pinkman  So, no matter what I do, hooray for me because I'm a great guy?
jesse_pinkman  It's all good?
jesse_pinkman  No matter how many dogs I kill, I just what, do an inventory and accept?
jesse_pinkman  I mean, you back your truck over your own kid and you, like, accept?
jesse_pinkman  What a load of crap!
group_leader  Hey, Jesse,
group_leader  I know you're in pain.
jesse_pinkman  No, yyou know what?
jesse_pinkman  Why I'm here in the first place?
jesse_pinkman  Is to sell you meth.

hank_schrader  Thanks.
george_merkert  Steve said you might have something for us.
hank_schrader  Yeah, maybe.
hank_schrader  You guys are going to have to tell me.
hank_schrader  Remember my pal Tim Roberts?
hank_schrader  APD detective?
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, he's working on a murder case,
hank_schrader  and the victim's a 34yearold male Caucasian by the name of Gale Boetticher.
hank_schrader  One night last month, Boetticher opens the door Bam, take a bullet to the face from a person or persons unknown.
hank_schrader  Now, this Gale Boetticher is a bona fide chemistry genius. I
hank_schrader  I mean, he's got degrees up the wazoo, right?
hank_schrader  And, uh, as you might expect, he's a nerd's nerd.
hank_schrader  Vegan, sandals and socks kind of guy.
hank_schrader  it turns out, he's also an Anumber 1 meth cook.
hank_schrader  And what caught my eye is, uh, his specialty product's blue.
steven_gomez  So what are you thinking?
steven_gomez  This is your Heisenberg?
hank_schrader  No. What
hank_schrader  What I think we got here is, uh, ahem, Heisenberg's former cook and maybe a line on Heisenberg himself.
hank_schrader  Anyway, uh, lo and behold, amidst all the hippiedippie nonsense, ahem, I find this.
hank_schrader  Now, this here I do a little Googlefu, and I I realize it's a parts number specifically for this baby.
hank_schrader  that there is a highvolume HEPA industrial air filtration system.
hank_schrader  That's a $300,000 gadget.
hank_schrader  Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant or microchip factory or maybe the biggest meth lab north of the border.
hank_schrader  So this little dingus here is manufactured by a big international concern Madrigal Electromotive. I
hank_schrader  I call their Houston office, and eventually I get through to the nicest little I
hank_schrader  I use some of the Schrader sweet talk on her.
hank_schrader  Before you know it, she's pulling files for me.
hank_schrader  Turns out six months ago, one of these systems was shipped to a depot right here in ABQ.
hank_schrader  Who signed for it?
hank_schrader  Gale Boetticher.
hank_schrader  So I asked my new girlfriend who paid for it
hank_schrader  and she says" Nobody.
hank_schrader  They have no record that anybody actually paid for this thing.
hank_schrader  So I go back and push more, and before you know it, uh, the temp's gone, there's no forwarding address,
hank_schrader  and I'm talking to some snotnose corporate lawyer who's asking me for my badge number.
hank_schrader  Brick wall.
hank_schrader  So I take a peek into Madrigal Electromotive.
Hank_Schrader  Now, Madrigal is based in Hanover, Germany, but they're what they call highly diversified Industrial
hank_schrader  Industrial equipment, global shipping, major construction, and a tiny little foothold in American fast food, specifically a local chain
hank_schrader  Pollos Hermanos.
hank_schrader  Okay.
hank_schrader  So what, right
hank_schrader  right? Boetticher's dead.
hank_schrader  I got no line on who's been bankrolling him or where his lab was.
hank_schrader  The whole thing's a snipe hunt, right?
hank_schrader  But now I get this crazy idea, and I can't shake it
hank_schrader  I mean, I I stay up nights staring at the ceiling and trying to make sense of it
hank_schrader  that napkin.
hank_schrader  Remember I told you Boetticher's vegan,
hank_schrader  I mean, we're talking this guy makes his own fermented lentil bread or whatever the hell that is.
hank_schrader  What's a vegan doing in a fried chicken joint?
hank_schrader  Maybe he's meeting somebody.
hank_schrader  Well,
hank_schrader  like maybe this guy.
hank_schrader  I mean, what do we know about Gustavo Fring? Huh
hank_schrader  This whole" friend of law enforcement" thing,
hank_schrader  could be a case of keep your friends close but your enemies closer.
hank_schrader  He's got the money to finance this operation.
hank_schrader  Maybe he's got the connections, too.
hank_schrader  Maybe, just maybe he's our guy.
george_merkert  Hank, no offense, but I think you're really reaching.
steven_gomez  If your guy had his meeting at KFC, you wouldn't immediately assume that he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.
hank_schrader  You know, I ahem I
hank_schrader  couldn't agree more, guys.
hank_schrader  Gustavo Fring, blue meth,
hank_schrader  whole thing is offthemap nuts.
hank_schrader  I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat, you know?
hank_schrader  Except I can't seem to wrap my mind around this one little thing, and that is what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?
