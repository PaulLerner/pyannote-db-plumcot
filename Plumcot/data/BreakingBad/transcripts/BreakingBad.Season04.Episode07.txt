#unknown Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad It was all about sending a message.
#unknown Which they did.
#unknown "Ready to talk?" Jesse? What about you? No judgments.
#unknown Tim stopped by.
#unknown He brought over some file boxes on that case.
#unknown Since when the vegans eat fried chicken? Hey, excuse me.
#unknown Why me? I like to think I see things in people.
#unknown That car contradicts our story.
#unknown It goes back tomorrow.
#unknown [blows landing on TV] [gunfire, blows continue] [Man] Came out of nowhere.
#unknown You gotta help us.
#unknown Look at all this damn water.
#unknown [Man #2] Don't drink that.
#unknown Ain't no telling what's gonna be poison.
#unknown [gunfire] [gunfire continues] [gunshot] [body thuds] [groans] [gasps] [panting] [gunshot] [buzzer] [air blowing] How's Junior? Oh, exactly what I expected.
#unknown He hasn't said a word to me since we told him it was going back.
#unknown I spoke to the dealership.
#unknown They didn't want to take it.
#unknown What? It's in perfect condition.
#unknown It's got 17 miles on the odometer.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I spent the better part of an hour sweettalking the manager down to a restocking fee $800.
#unknown $800 for two days? Well, the law says they don't have to take it back at all.
#unknown All right, here's the registration, and the window sticker, the receipt.
#unknown Oh, and make sure you talk to the general manager.
#unknown His name is Glen.
#unknown Glen.
#unknown Call me if there's a problem.
#unknown And please, just don't don't tangle with anyone.
#unknown Fine.
#unknown Oh! Bueno, Martine.
#unknown Muy bueno.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown [tires screeching] [screeching continues] [grunting, panting] [engine revving] Whoohoohoohoo! Hoo! Whoo! [crash] [grunts] [engine idles] [engine revving] [tires spinning] Shit.
#unknown [engine stops] God.
#unknown [sighs] [alarm chiming] [sighs] [fire crackling] [groans] [dialing] Yes.
#unknown Hello.
#unknown I need a cab.
#unknown Yes, thank you.
#unknown The name is White.
#unknown Uh, I'm at the Pavilion parking lot on University.
#unknown Oh, yes, that's right.
#unknown Just south of the airport.
#unknown Oh, that'd be great.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Oh, how long do you think that would take.
#unknown No, I'm sure he'll see me.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown [Saul] Contrition? [chuckling] Hey, there's There's total contrition here! There's mountains of contrition! Fantantastic! I will messenger 'em over right away.
#unknown Oh, and [clears throat] about that other thing unrelated Yes, I can get you in.
#unknown But I gotta warn you, the eighth hole is murder.
#unknown Oh, yeah? You want to make it interesting? Great! Tee time 7 a.
#unknown m.
#unknown sharp.
#unknown Prepare to have your ass handed to you.
#unknown [chuckles] Okay.
#unknown Bye.
#unknown [phone chimes] He was headed for destruction of property, but since it's your own property, I sweated him down to misdemeanor trash burning.
#unknown [chuckles] The only thing is, it's not gonna be free.
#unknown There's a 5 grand fine, another 3 grand to steam clean the blacktop.
#unknown So bottom line, your little joyride's gonna set you back about 52,000 bucks, so was it worth it? I don't need to hear the blowbyblow.
#unknown Just tell me it's done.
#unknown I'm sorry, did I wake you? I caught this thing before it got into the system.
#unknown That means your record stays clean.
#unknown The wife never finds out.
#unknown I've been working magic here.
#unknown I can at least get an "attaboy.
#unknown " [sighs] Fine.
#unknown Rebel without a cause, give.
#unknown What is it, Fring? He will see me dead and there's nothing I can do about it.
#unknown All that's left is to wait.
#unknown And we're sure about this.
#unknown 'Cause Pinkman ss he needs you too much.
#unknown "Pinkman says.
#unknown " [chuckles] [groans] "Pinkman says.
#unknown " Unless you could help me find a third party.
#unknown What third party? Someone who can ameliorate the situation.
#unknown Let's ditch the thesaurus, all right? You talking about a hit man? Assuming that's still what they're called.
#unknown Zzzzt! Wrong answer! That's what the kids call "epic fail.
#unknown " [exhales] All I would need is a phone number.
#unknown I would do the rest.
#unknown Saul, there'd be a finder's fee.
#unknown A big one.
#unknown Look, if you held my feet to the fire, I could come up with a couple names One or two guys west of the Rockies who do this kind of work But guess what.
#unknown These guys? They know Mike.
#unknown And Mike knows them.
#unknown What are you telling me? Mike knows everyone who does this? Who do you think gave me their names? Okay, Plan B.
#unknown Look, we go outside my network Craigslist, Soldier of Fortune.
#unknown Let's say we get lucky, I mean, incredibly lucky, and find a guy who's not an undercover cop or some kind of survivalist nutjob wannabe.
#unknown You gotta ask yourself How good is good enough? Because whatever goomba we buy at some point is gonna come headtohead with our friend Mike.
#unknown And Gus Fring? Just winging that guy is not gonna ameliorate your situation, not by a damn sight.
#unknown I tried to, but I can't get anywhere near him.
#unknown You can't get near him? Why don't you ask your partner? Yeah, I saw him.
#unknown And you tell Saul before you tell me? Look, he's my lawyer, same as yours.
#unknown Every time I go over there, Saul hassles me about Mike.
#unknown He's still scared the dude's gonna come break his legs.
#unknown So I give him the latest.
#unknown But what happened exactly? I was at a diner with Mike, and he just shows up.
#unknown They send me outside and the two of them talk.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown So this is, like, a regular thing? [sighs] How close were you to him? Close.
#unknown Closer than you and me right now.
#unknown Did he speak to you? It was over in 10 seconds.
#unknown Would you just answer? He said he sees things in people.
#unknown What things? What people? Me.
#unknown He said he sees something in me.
#unknown A month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us, and now he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as what, an assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you.
#unknown What kind of game is he playing? Does he think you're that naive? He can't truly think that you'd forget Well, let alone Gale, let alone Victor, and all the horror that goes along with all of that.
#unknown What about this girlfriend of yours and her little brother? The man looked you straight in the eye and told you "no more children," but that very night, that little boy he winds up Gus can't possibly think that you'd forget that.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I mean, all I'm saying is that is it possible he would think that you're that weakwilled? Drop the sales pitch.
#unknown I'll do it.
#unknown You'll do what? I'll kill him first chance I get.
#unknown [air blowing] PiÃ±a colada? More like stale bubblegum.
#unknown Does anyone actually want their car to smell like the bottom of a sixthgrader's desk? Okay.
#unknown Hemp? Really? Yeah, I know.
#unknown But you know what they say The customer's always right.
#unknown Ooh! Speaking of customer, it's not too late to have a grand opening.
#unknown I was thinking huge party, balloons, bouncy house for the kids, you know, make a splash, get on TV.
#unknown Let people know they're not gonna have to face the eyebrows of doom when they come in.
#unknown Marie, how's Hank doing? You know what? He's doing better.
#unknown Really? Yeah.
#unknown Uh lately his mood's improved, and he's like a maniac with his P.
#unknown T.
#unknown That's fantastic.
#unknown Yeah, don't get me wrong.
#unknown He's got a long way to go, but he [door opens] Yeah.
#unknown I mean  Oh, hey.
#unknown Hey!  Hi, Walt.
#unknown Marie.
#unknown It's good to see you.
#unknown [Chuckles]  You, too.
#unknown Hey, your cashier here is quite the salesperson.
#unknown She just talked me into something called the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown No, it's very important to maintain your clear coat.
#unknown Boy, once that goes [clicks tongue] Oh, yeah.
#unknown Um, hi.
#unknown [nervous chuckle] Hi.
#unknown [Skyler] Bogdan was averaging and we are already up to 22 Lat night, I deposited $3,800.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown How much is that? $274,000.
#unknown Give or take.
#unknown Give or take?  Yeah.
#unknown I haven't counted it.
#unknown Wait And this is how often? Every two weeks.
#unknown Thursday's good for a dropoff? Wait, Walt.
#unknown Are you telling me you make $7,125,000 a year? before expenses.
#unknown But I can't [stammering] This is too much.
#unknown So it's more than you thought, and this is somehow bad news? No, that's not the point.
#unknown I mean, there is no car wash in the world that could do this kind of business.
#unknown I mean, this is 9 month's work here minimum.
#unknown That could take years.
#unknown So set some aside.
#unknown Save it for a rainy day.
#unknown Save it.
#unknown What Save it where? I can't go to the bank with it.
#unknown I sure can't leave it here.
#unknown Ohh Oi.
#unknown Wait a minute.
#unknown Is this all 50s? Who pays for a car wash with a 50? Skyler, I didn't ask you to do this.
#unknown I was under the impression that you had this under control.
#unknown I just didn't expect this amount of money.
#unknown The 50s are gonna be a problem.
#unknown Well, that's what this is Problem solving.
#unknown Skyler, this is a simple division of labor.
#unknown I bring in the money, you launder the money.
#unknown This is what you wanted.
#unknown I never wanted any of this.
#unknown I've got to go.
#unknown If you want out, just say that you want out.
#unknown Okay, then.
#unknown [air hissing] [switch clicks] [whirring] [whirring] [whirring] You're telling me you made this in the lab? Why not? Making it in his own lab seemed appropriate.
#unknown There's not much of it.
#unknown We had more for Tuco.
#unknown It's enough.
#unknown This is still the best way.
#unknown You go after him with a gun, you'll never get out of it alive.
#unknown But with this, you slip it into his food or drink, there shouldn't be any taste or smell, A man his age, working as hard as he does, no one will be surprised.
#unknown What about Mike? Mike can have his suspicions, but that's all they'll be.
#unknown Please, one homicidal maniac at a time.
#unknown I don't know when I'm gonna see Gus again I mean, if ever.
#unknown Keep it with you.
#unknown When you have the opportunity, be ready.
#unknown What if they search me? Will they do that? It's the wrong way around.
#unknown It's my lucky cigarette.
#unknown Well, whatever you do, don't smoke it.
#unknown [Walter Jr.
#unknown ] You know they have a drivethru, right? [Hank] Nah, this is good.
#unknown Could use the exercise.
#unknown Get he blood pumping.
#unknown Don't worry, you're not gonna have to pick me up.
#unknown It might take me a while, but I'll get there.
#unknown Jesus, ain't we a pair? You must really like chicken.
#unknown V8, 470 horses, satellite radio, Bluetooth, Whoa.
#unknown What do you mean, on a lark? Spur of the moment, your dad just ups and buys you a brandnew Challenger? Yeah, I barely got around the block and Mom said we couldn't afford it, so they took it back.
#unknown Do you know how long I had it? Fifteen hours.
#unknown Well, hey, buddy, let me tell you something.
#unknown When I was your age, I'd have given my left nut to drive a car like that for 15 minutes.
#unknown But seriously, how does that happen? Well, we were looking at used cars, and I kind of Ahh.
#unknown You guilted him into it.
#unknown Yeah, yeah.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I hear you.
#unknown You pulled the old "Poor little me and my little troubles.
#unknown "  Am I right?  Maybe.
#unknown Yeah, well, you flew too close to the sun, my friend.
#unknown You'd have let him buy you a clunker you'd be driving now, instead of borrowing Mom's hooptie.
#unknown Agent Schrader.
#unknown Oh, hey.
#unknown How you doing?  Well, thank you.
#unknown Good to see you.
#unknown Walter Junior, do you remember Mr.
#unknown Fring?  How are you?  Well.
#unknown Nice to see you again.
#unknown It's a pleasure to see you here.
#unknown You're looking very well.
#unknown Yeah, well, you know, chalk it up to clean living and vitamin pills.
#unknown [chuckles] I must apologize.
#unknown If I had seen you come in, there would have been no question of accepting your money.
#unknown In the future, please feel free to ask for me.
#unknown A DEA hero should never have to pay for a meal at Pollos Hermanos.
#unknown No kidding? I'll take you up on that for sure.
#unknown And how are your mother and father? They're good.
#unknown The chicken is great.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown If ever you're interested in rewarding parttime work, perhaps something after school? My door is always open.
#unknown Sounds good.
#unknown Uh, I don't know about this one.
#unknown He might eat up all your profits.
#unknown Well, I'll let you finish your meal.
#unknown Can I get you anything else? A refill, perhaps? No, thank you.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Take a Diet Coke.
#unknown Thank you very much.
#unknown Of course.
#unknown [door slams] So where are we going? Oh, big doings today.
#unknown The order of the day is eyes open, mouth shut.
#unknown S'up? Test, test.
#unknown You got me? Count off.
#unknown [door slams] Let's go.
#unknown Right here.
#unknown Leave the wrap on, please.
#unknown You know how to make coffee? Sure.
#unknown There you go.
#unknown You want a rundown?  Please.
#unknown Three guys up at the gate Two visible, one in the blind.
#unknown We got five guys down here with a backup out of sight.
#unknown I got Tyrus down in the treeline with a Barret .
#unknown 50.
#unknown Planted him there last night in case we had any early arrivals.
#unknown [voice fades] [loud dripping] [machine whirring] [loud dripping] [groans] I don't have an extra holster.
#unknown You stick this in your pocket.
#unknown Keep it out of sight.
#unknown If you're gonna be here today, you're gonna have a gun.
#unknown It's loaded? [sighs] I don't want to see that in your hand unless you see me with mine.
#unknown Understood? Emergency only.
#unknown First car is coming.
#unknown All right, what's the order of the day? Eyes open, mouth shut.
#unknown A lot of guns.
#unknown Nobody's asking you to give up yours.
#unknown You want to sweep the place before you bring in your guys? I am the guy.
#unknown All right, then.
#unknown [all speaking Spanish] You got something of mine? Glove box.
#unknown Figure I better teach you how to shoot.
#unknown Could be things are gonna get hairy.
#unknown What is this? You're giving me a gun? And now I'm, like, part of the team or whatever? [sighs] He said he sees something in me.
#unknown Like what? If I had to put it in a word I'd guess loyalty.
#unknown Loyalty.
#unknown Only maybe you got it for the wrong guy.
#unknown Jesse? Hey.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Long time, no see.
#unknown How you doing? Yeah, you know, uh good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Okay, we're going to get started.
#unknown You coming in? So the truth is we can't change the past.
#unknown What's done is done.
#unknown We've got to own our actions, but putting ourselves on trial, acting as our own judge, jury, and executioner, it's not the answer because a lot of the time all that judging does is just ensure that we're going to repeat the cycle.
#unknown Right.
#unknown "I'm such an asshhole.
#unknown " "It's totally hopeless.
#unknown " "What's the point?" "I think I'll have a hit.
#unknown " Jesse.
#unknown What's going on with you these days? [sigh] I went back to the crystal.
#unknown You sober now? Yeah.
#unknown Four days.
#unknown Big whoop, right? Four days is four days.
#unknown You're here.
#unknown You still working at the laundry? How are things there.
#unknown Sucks ass.
#unknown [chuckling] Anything you want to talk about? Uh a couple of weeks back I, uh killed a dog.
#unknown You hit it with your car? No, um I put him down.
#unknown I watched him go.
#unknown I was looking him straight in the eye and you know, he didn't know what was happening.
#unknown He didn't know why.
#unknown He He was just scared, and then he was gone.
#unknown He was suffering.
#unknown It was a kindness.
#unknown No, he wasn't sick.
#unknown No, he was just, like a I don't know, like a problem dog.
#unknown What did he do? Bite someone? Uh, this dog never never bit anybody.
#unknown He was, uh You pick up the rock, you go right to the dark side.
#unknown Anything can happen.
#unknown It ain't no rock that made me do it.
#unknown Well, what was the problem? Why did you have to kill him? Watch the crosstalk, please.
#unknown Maybe it's not the details that matter.
#unknown Right? How'd you feel about what you did, Jesse? I don't know.
#unknown Who cares how you feel? What kind of a person kills a dog for no reason? Colleen.
#unknown You put an ad in the paper.
#unknown You drop him off at a shelter.
#unknown Colleen  You just don't sit there and talk about killing a helpless  Colleen.
#unknown innocent animal.
#unknown We're not here to sit in judgment.
#unknown Why not? Why not? Maybe Maybe she's right.
#unknown You know, maybe I should have put it in the paper.
#unknown Maybe I should have done something different.
#unknown The thing is, if you just do stuff and nothing happens what's it all mean? What's the point? All right, this whole thing is about selfacceptance.
#unknown Kicking the hell out of yourself doesn't give meaning to anything.
#unknown So I should stop judging  and accept  [Man] It's a start.
#unknown So, no matter what I do, hooray for me because I'm a great guy? It's all good? No matter how many dogs I kill, I just what, do an inventory and accept? I mean, you back your truck over your own kid and you, like, accept? What a load of crap! Hey, Jesse, I know you're in pain.
#unknown No, yyou know what? Why I'm here in the first place? Is to sell you meth.
#unknown You're nothing to me but customers! I made you my bitch.
#unknown You okay with that? Huh? You accept? No.
#unknown About time.
#unknown [cough] Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Bring that light over here, will you? [cough] You see any residue there? Where? Here.
#unknown On the bottom, right right there.
#unknown [whispering] It's been a week.
#unknown What's going on? I haven't seen him.
#unknown I didn't think so, but I'll just give it another shot anyway.
#unknown Heyheyhey, buddy!  Hey.
#unknown Look at that.
#unknown Graduated to doorman.
#unknown Finally found your calling.
#unknown Ha ha! Ooh! Little whiskers, Marie.
#unknown What did you do, show your barber a picture of a dog's ass and said "I'll take that"? Charming as usual.
#unknown Welcome back.
#unknown Looking good, Marie.
#unknown Oh, thanks, Steve.
#unknown Good to see you.
#unknown How you doing?  He's doing fine.
#unknown We, uh, we can take it from here.
#unknown Right, Gomie?  Yeah.
#unknown If you want to hold his elbow.
#unknown No, no, no, no.
#unknown You keep your mitts off me.
#unknown I'm good, I'm good.
#unknown [Marie] Hey.
#unknown Good luck.
#unknown Let's go.
#unknown Running late.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Hank, seeing you walk in I can't tell you what that means to all of us.
#unknown Your progress, it's incredible.
#unknown Yeah, well, chalk it up to can living and vitamin pills.
#unknown Steve tell you his news? What? Finally got your period? I made GS 14.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown That's all right, man.
#unknown Next stop, Washington, D.
#unknown C.
#unknown , sitting behind a desk, papers piled so high, you can't see over them.
#unknown Hey, better you than me, buddy.
#unknown Seriously, congratulations, buddy.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Steve said you might have something for us.
#unknown Yeah, maybe.
#unknown You guys are going to have to tell me.
#unknown Remember my pal Tim Roberts? APD detective? Yeah, well, he's working on a murder case, and the victim's a 34yearold male Caucasian by the name of Gale Boetticher.
#unknown One night last month, Boetticher opens the door Bam, take a bullet to the face from a person or persons unknown.
#unknown Now, this Gale Boetticher is a bona fide chemistry genius.
#unknown I mean, he's got degrees up the wazoo, right? And, uh, as you might expect, he's a nerd's nerd.
#unknown Vegan, sandals and socks kind of guy.
#unknown As it turns out, he's also an Anumber 1 meth cook.
#unknown And what caught my eye is, uh, his specialty product's blue.
#unknown So what are you thinking? This is your Heisenberg? No.
#unknown What I think we got here is, uh, ahem, Heisenberg's former cook and maybe a line on Heisenberg himself.
#unknown Anyway, uh, lo and behold, amidst all the hippiedippie nonsense, ahem, I find this.
#unknown Now, this here I do a little Googlefu, and I I realize it's a parts number specifically for this baby.
#unknown Now, that there is a highvolume HEPA industrial air filtration system.
#unknown That's a $300,000 gadget.
#unknown Perfect for a pharmaceutical plant or microchip factory or maybe the biggest meth lab north of the border.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So this little dingus here is manufactured by a big international concern Madrigal Electromotive.
#unknown I call their Houston office, and eventually I get through to the nicest little I use some of the Schrader sweet talk on her.
#unknown Before you know it, she's pulling files for me.
#unknown Turns out six months ago, one of these systems was shipped to a depot right here in ABQ.
#unknown Who signed for it? Gale Boetticher.
#unknown So I asked my new girlfriend who paid for it, and she says "Nobody.
#unknown " They have no record that anybody actually paid for this thing.
#unknown So I go back and push more, and before you know it, uh, the temp's gone, there's no forwarding address, and I'm talking to some snotnose corporate lawyer who's asking me for my badge number.
#unknown Brick wall.
#unknown So I take a peek into Madrigal Electromotive.
#unknown Now, Madrigal is based in Hanover, Germany, but they're what they call highly diversified Industrial equipment, global shipping, major construction, and a tiny little foothold in American fast food, specifically a local chain Pollos Hermanos.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown So what, right? Boetticher's dead.
#unknown I got no line on who's been bankrolling him or where his lab was.
#unknown The whole thing's a snipe hunt, right? But now I get this crazy idea, and I can't shake it.
#unknown I mean, I I stay up nights staring at the ceiling and trying to make sense of it.
#unknown It's that napkin.
#unknown Remember I told you Boetticher's vegan, right? I mean, we're talking this guy makes his own fermented lentil bread or whatever the hell that is.
#unknown What's a vegan doing in a fried chicken joint? Maybe he's meeting somebody.
#unknown Like who? Well, like maybe this guy.
#unknown I mean, what do we know about Gustavo Fring? Huh? This whole "friend of law enforcement" thing, eh, could be a case of keep your friends close but your enemies closer.
#unknown He's got the money to finance this operation.
#unknown Maybe he's got the connections, too.
#unknown Maybe, just maybe he's our guy.
#unknown Hank, no offense, but I think you're really reaching.
#unknown If your guy had his meeting at KFC, you wouldn't immediately assume that he's sitting down with Colonel Sanders.
#unknown You know, I ahem I couldn't agree more, guys.
#unknown Gustavo Fring, blue meth, you know The whole thing is offthemap nuts.
#unknown I ought to be wearing a tinfoil hat, you know? Except I can't seem to wrap my mind around this one little thing, and that is what are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?
