jane_margolis  Seriously?
marie_schrader  What are you doing?
hank_schrader  Beating off.
hank_schrader  What's it look like?
marie_schrader  That is in fact exactly what it looks like to me.
hank_schrader  Brewing is an art form, Marie. I
hank_schrader  I think you'd appreciate that by now. Christmas
hank_schrader  Christmas, batch of '06?
hank_schrader  Come on
marie_schrader  So let me get this straight.
marie_schrader  You call in sick the day after receiving a longawaited careerboosting promotion so you can play Oktoberfest in your man cave?
marie_schrader  I don't get it.
marie_schrader  Really, I don't.
hank_schrader  relax.
marie_schrader  Please, don't tell me to relax.
hank_schrader  Sorry, I forgot. You
marie_schrader  You know I hate that. Right
hank_schrader  Right.
marie_schrader  Dave said I should express that.
hank_schrader  All I'm saying is everything's fine.
hank_schrader  I can take a day.
hank_schrader  No big deal.
hank_schrader  Now get that sweet ass out of here so I can concentrate.
jesse_pinkman  Okay, so, what's the plan?
walter_white  The plan is we cook.
jesse_pinkman  Why are we cooking when we can't even move what we cook?
walter_white  Well, how much do you think you can sell on your own?
walter_white  Say if I cook during the days and you work the nights.
jesse_pinkman  What?
walter_white  Prior to Tuco, that was your plan, wasn't it?
walter_white  I understand it'll be a fraction of what we brought in before but still, what choice do we have?
jesse_pinkman  First of all, there's no we.
jesse_pinkman  Okay?
jesse_pinkman  You're talking me, solo, busting hump slinging shards.
jesse_pinkman  I got profile now.
jesse_pinkman  Don't you get that?
jesse_pinkman  DEA's up my ass.
jesse_pinkman  No, I'm not exposing myself to that level of risk for chump change. No
jesse_pinkman  No way. Then
walter_white  Then what do you suggest?
walter_white  I don't think either of us are eager to jump into bed with another Tuco.
jesse_pinkman  I got bills, man.
walter_white  You've got bills?
jesse_pinkman  Rent, yo.
jesse_pinkman  Responsibilities.
jesse_pinkman  I've already lost more than I've made and I am tired of dicking around out here.
walter_white  You wanna know how much I've got left?
walter_white  After completing my first round of treatment and financing the world's most expensive alibi?
walter_white  Zero.
walter_white  Zip.
walter_white  Nothing.
walter_white  I've got nothing to show for all of this.
walter_white  Nothing for my family which, as you might remember, was the whole damn point.
walter_white  But seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option that leaves us with a total of two choices.
walter_white  We go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic or you and I start
walter_white  You selling whatever you can.
jesse_pinkman  There's a third way.
walter_white  And what would that be?
jesse_pinkman  We got to be Tuco. All
jesse_pinkman  Cut
jesse_pinkman  Cut out the middleman. Run
jesse_pinkman  Run our own game.
walter_white  So you're going to what?
walter_white  Snort meth off a bowie knife?
walter_white  You gonna beat your homeys to death when they" dis" you?
jesse_pinkman  Look, I know some guys.
jesse_pinkman  All right?
jesse_pinkman  I can create a network.
jesse_pinkman  Look, we control production and distribution.
jesse_pinkman  That way, we stay off the front lines while moving some serious glass. I
jesse_pinkman  I mean, the point here is to make money, right?
jesse_pinkman  Skyhigh stacks.
jesse_pinkman  No?
jesse_pinkman  That's not the point?
walter_white  No, I am not willing to do that.
jesse_pinkman  Who said anything about you?
walter_white  I don't vote for this plan.
walter_white  I'm not comfortable bringing in unknown entities into our operation.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah?
jesse_pinkman  Well, you don't get to vote.
walter_white  your pardon
walter_white  This is a partnership, remember?
jesse_pinkman  I rem Oh, I remember.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, you cook, I sell.
jesse_pinkman  That was the division of labour when we started all this.
jesse_pinkman  And that's exactly how we should have kept it.
jesse_pinkman  Because I sure as hell didn't find myself locked in a trunk or on my knees with a gun to my head before your greedy old ass came along.
jesse_pinkman  All right,
walter_white  I will admit to a bit of a learning curve.
walter_white  And perhaps I was overly ambitious.
walter_white  In any case, it's not gonna happen that way anymore.
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, damn straight.
jesse_pinkman  Know why?
jesse_pinkman  Because we do things my way this time or I walk.
jesse_pinkman  You need
jesse_pinkman  I need you, Walt. Yo, enter my casa. Yo,
jesse_pinkman  Skinny Pete. What's up

marie_schrader  Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell.
marie_schrader  Human heads, they leave.
marie_schrader  The cartels, they litter the place with human heads.
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, pretty sure that's why I'm going
marie_schrader  there. It's like a calling card or a shoutout or something.
marie_schrader  Now, D. C., on the other hand, I could get behind.
marie_schrader  You just do your time like a good boy and I could see us in a cute little condo in Georgetown in a couple of years.
marie_schrader  I went online to this fantastic real estate website for D.
marie_schrader  There's just so much, I don't know, culture there.
marie_schrader  I was talking to Melinda, Hank's boss's wife. I
marie_schrader  I told you about the one with helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

hank_schrader  You know what it is?
hank_schrader  cockroach comes out from under a fridge, what do you do?
hank_schrader  I mean, you don't think about it.
hank_schrader  them down.
walter_white  do they come from?
walter_white  Criminals, like the one you. I mean, what do you think it is that makes them who they are?
hank_schrader  Buddy, you might as well be asking me about the roaches.
hank_schrader  All I know is there's a whole world of them out
hank_schrader  I gotta piss like a racehorse.
walter_white  Wasn't sure it was you.
walter_white  New car?
jesse_pinkman  Yeah, keeping things on the DL.
walter_white  I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.
jesse_pinkman  Fifteen K.
jesse_pinkman  That's what I'm talking about.
jesse_pinkman  You're welcome.
jesse_pinkman  Jesus.
walter_white  Help me understand the math,
walter_white  I gave you 1 pound, correct?
walter_white  You and I split $2,000 per ounce.
walter_white  $1,000 each.
walter_white  One pound, that's 16 ounces.
walter_white  Sixteen ounces should net to me $16,000.
walter_white  Not 15.
jesse_pinkman  Something came up.
walter_white  Something came up? One
jesse_pinkman  my guys got held up by a couple junkies.
jesse_pinkman  Lost an ounce. But
jesse_pinkman  But it's cool, okay?
jesse_pinkman  Skinny Pete's cool.
walter_white  So you're saying that your guy got robbed Or
walter_white  Or rather you got robbed.
walter_white  but it doesn't matter.
walter_white  Dude, it's called breakage, okay?
jesse_pinkman  Like Kmart.
jesse_pinkman  Shit breaks.
walter_white  And you're thinking this is acceptable?
jesse_pinkman  It's the cost of business, yo.
jesse_pinkman  You're sweating me over a grand?
walter_white  Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
walter_white  I'm not the street guy, yo.
walter_white  it seems to me that what you call breakage is just you making a fool of yourself.
walter_white  I've got another technical term for you.
walter_white  Nonsustainable business model.
jesse_pinkman  You're focusing on the negative.
jesse_pinkman  Six grand a day we're making.
jesse_pinkman  What's your problem?
walter_white  What happens when word gets out and it's open season on these clowns you've hired?
walter_white  Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman drug lord, can be robbed with impunity.
jesse_pinkman  come on.
walter_white  You think Tuco had breakage?
walter_white  I guess it's true, he did.
walter_white  He broke bones.
walter_white  He broke the skull of anybody who tried to rip him off.
jesse_pinkman  want another grand? Is
jesse_pinkman  that it
walter_white  my point.
jesse_pinkman  Take it.
jesse_pinkman  Here.

jesse_pinkman  My guys get what they're up against and they're careful.
jesse_pinkman  So am I.
jesse_pinkman  And you're all tucked in at night with your precious family.
jesse_pinkman  So why don't you just stop being such a freak about everything?
walter_white  You've made the division of labour very clear.
jesse_pinkman  Yo, I mean, seriously what the hell do you want me to do, huh?
