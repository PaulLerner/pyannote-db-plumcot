#unknown If you blow this, I want you gone.
#unknown I know guys that'll have your skinny ass out back by the Dumpster faster than you can blink.
#unknown I'll fill it in.
#unknown Just sign your name.
#unknown Which is what, by the way? It's Jesse.
#unknown Jesse Jackson.
#unknown Seriously? What? What are you doing? Beating off.
#unknown What's it look like? That is in fact exactly what it looks like to me.
#unknown Brewing is an art form, Marie.
#unknown I think you'd appreciate that by now.
#unknown Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.
#unknown So let me get this straight.
#unknown You call in sick the day after receiving a longawaited careerboosting promotion so you can play Oktoberfest in your man cave? I don't get it.
#unknown Really, I don't.
#unknown Babe, relax.
#unknown Please, don't tell me to relax.
#unknown Sorry, I forgot.
#unknown You know I hate that.
#unknown Right.
#unknown Dave said I should express that.
#unknown All I'm saying is everything's fine.
#unknown I can take a day.
#unknown No big deal.
#unknown Now get that sweet ass out of here so I can concentrate.
#unknown Okay, so, what's the plan? The plan is we cook.
#unknown Why are we cooking when we can't even move what we cook? Well, how much do you think you can sell on your own? Say if I cook during the days and you work the nights.
#unknown Dude.
#unknown What? Prior to Tuco, that was your plan, wasn't it? I understand it'll be a fraction of what we brought in before but still, what choice do we have? First of all, there's no we.
#unknown Okay? You're talking me, solo, busting hump slinging shards.
#unknown I got profile now.
#unknown Don't you get that? DEA's up my ass.
#unknown No, I'm not exposing myself to that level of risk for chump change.
#unknown No way.
#unknown Then what do you suggest? I don't think either of us are eager to jump into bed with another Tuco.
#unknown I got bills, man.
#unknown You've got bills? Rent, yo.
#unknown Responsibilities.
#unknown I've already lost more than I've made and I am tired of dicking around out here.
#unknown You wanna know how much I've got left? After completing my first round of treatment and financing the world's most expensive alibi? Zero.
#unknown Zip.
#unknown Nothing.
#unknown I've got nothing to show for all of this.
#unknown Nothing for my family which, as you might remember, was the whole damn point.
#unknown But seeing as throwing in the towel is not an option that leaves us with a total of two choices.
#unknown We go into business with yet another homicidal lunatic or you and I start You selling whatever you can.
#unknown There's a third way.
#unknown And what would that be? We got to be Tuco.
#unknown All right? Cut out the middleman.
#unknown Run our own game.
#unknown So you're going to what? Snort meth off a bowie knife? You gonna beat your homeys to death when they "dis" you? Look, I know some guys.
#unknown All right? I can create a network.
#unknown Look, we control production and distribution.
#unknown That way, we stay off the front lines while moving some serious glass.
#unknown I mean, the point here is to make money, right? Skyhigh stacks.
#unknown No.
#unknown No? That's not the point? No, I am not willing to do that.
#unknown Who said anything about you? I don't vote for this plan.
#unknown I'm not comfortable bringing in unknown entities into our operation.
#unknown Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.
#unknown I beg your pardon? This is a partnership, remember? I rem Oh, I remember.
#unknown Yeah, you cook, I sell.
#unknown That was the division of labour when we started all this.
#unknown And that's exactly how we should have kept it.
#unknown Because I sure as hell didn't find myself locked in a trunk or on my knees with a gun to my head before your greedy old ass came along.
#unknown All right? All right, I will admit to a bit of a learning curve.
#unknown And perhaps I was overly ambitious.
#unknown In any case, it's not gonna happen that way anymore.
#unknown Yeah, damn straight.
#unknown Know why? Because we do things my way this time or I walk.
#unknown You need me more than I need you, Walt.
#unknown Yo, enter my casa.
#unknown Yo, Skinny Pete.
#unknown What's up, brother? What up with it, yo? Hey, Combo.

#unknown Seventeen.
#unknown Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.
#unknown All right? Everybody and their mother's gonna want a taste.
#unknown And second who else is selling right now, huh? It's dry out there, that's for sure.
#unknown Church.
#unknown So you point it how you want, okay? Quarter, half, teener, whatever.
#unknown But I make what I make.
#unknown Two large.
#unknown No exceptions.
#unknown Short me, you're out.
#unknown Cut it, you're out.
#unknown Period.
#unknown This is a big opportunity I am giving you.

#unknown It's not an armpit.
#unknown Oh, excuse me.
#unknown You're right.
#unknown It's the Paris of the Southwest.
#unknown Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.
#unknown Right on the border of lawless Mexican hell.
#unknown Human heads, they leave.
#unknown The cartels, they litter the place with human heads.
#unknown Yeah, well, pretty sure that's why I'm going there.
#unknown It's like a calling card or a shoutout or something.
#unknown Now, D.
#unknown C.
#unknown , on the other hand, I could get behind.
#unknown You just do your time like a good boy and I could see us in a cute little condo in Georgetown in a couple of years.
#unknown I went online to this fantastic real estate website for D.
#unknown C.
#unknown There's just so much, I don't know, culture there.
#unknown I was talking to Melinda, Hank's boss's wife.
#unknown I told you about the one with helmet hair and permanent lip liner.
#unknown Anyway, she was saying that when they were there Apologise.
#unknown What? I will not listen to one more word until you apologise.
#unknown For? You know perfectly well, Marie.
#unknown Well, obviously I don't Your lies.
#unknown To me.

#unknown Did you really think it was all just neatly gonna go away? Well, if you hadn't tried to return it Apologise.
#unknown Now or never.
#unknown I mean it.
#unknown Or it'll never be the same.
#unknown Why are you punishing me? If you don't respect me enough to apologise, to tell me the truth, then I need my sister back.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown What, do you want the gory details? Yeah.
#unknown Oh, yeah.
#unknown No, you don't.
#unknown Keep you up at night.
#unknown So was it scary? Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary, you little punk.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown But you were way faster than him.
#unknown Well, I'm here, aren't I? Yeah.
#unknown Hell, yeah.
#unknown Kick ass and take names.
#unknown Son.
#unknown No, it's fine.
#unknown You know what it is? A cockroach comes out from under a fridge, what do you do? I mean, you don't think about it.
#unknown You stomp them down.
#unknown Where do they come from? Criminals, like the one you.
#unknown I mean, what do you think it is that makes them who they are? Buddy, you might as well be asking me about the roaches.
#unknown All I know is there's a whole world of them out there.
#unknown Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.
#unknown Cops.
#unknown Cops! Wasn't sure it was you.
#unknown New car? Yeah, keeping things on the DL.
#unknown I'm guessing this one doesn't bounce.
#unknown Your half.
#unknown Fifteen K.
#unknown That's what I'm talking about.
#unknown You're welcome.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Help me understand the math, okay? I gave you 1 pound, correct? You and I split $2,000 per ounce.
#unknown $1,000 each.
#unknown One pound, that's 16 ounces.
#unknown Sixteen ounces should net to me $16,000.
#unknown Sixteen.
#unknown Not 15.
#unknown Something came up.
#unknown Something came up? One of my guys got held up by a couple junkies.
#unknown Lost an ounce.
#unknown But it's cool, okay? Skinny Pete's cool.
#unknown So you're saying that your guy got robbed Or rather you got robbed.
#unknown but it doesn't matter.
#unknown Dude, it's called breakage, okay? Like Kmart.
#unknown Shit breaks.
#unknown And you're thinking this is acceptable? It's the cost of business, yo.
#unknown You're sweating me over a grand? Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
#unknown I'm not the street guy, yo.
#unknown But it seems to me that what you call breakage is just you making a fool of yourself.
#unknown I've got another technical term for you.
#unknown Nonsustainable business model.
#unknown You're focusing on the negative.
#unknown Six grand a day we're making.
#unknown What's your problem? What happens when word gets out and it's open season on these clowns you've hired? Once everyone knows that Jesse Pinkman drug lord, can be robbed with impunity.
#unknown Man, come on.
#unknown You think Tuco had breakage? I guess it's true, he did.
#unknown He broke bones.
#unknown He broke the skull of anybody who tried to rip him off.
#unknown You want another grand? Is that it? That's not my point.
#unknown Take it.
#unknown Here.
#unknown Look, you got 15,000 you didn't have yesterday.
#unknown Hey, we're making bank.
#unknown Shit happens.
#unknown My guys get what they're up against and they're careful.
#unknown So am I.
#unknown And you're all tucked in at night with your precious family.
#unknown So why don't you just stop being such a freak about everything? You've made the division of labour very clear.
#unknown Yo, I mean, seriously what the hell do you want me to do, huh? Hey.
#unknown Sorry.
#unknown Wow, you snuck in.
#unknown Didn't even know you were home.
#unknown What you eating? A panini.
#unknown There's another one in the freezer if you want it.
#unknown I thought we nixed those, huh? Did we? Yeah.
#unknown I mean, aren't those the ones with the offthechart sodium? I had a craving.
#unknown Once in a while is no big deal.
#unknown So where's Jr.
#unknown ? Out.
#unknown With whom? Louis.
#unknown Out where? Somewhere.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown He'll be back by 9.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Yeah, I just thought you might have a clue where your son is.
#unknown Why don't you? Why am I the only one who needs to keep track of our son? I'll tell you what.
#unknown Wanna know where he is, ask him.
#unknown Just pick up the phone like I do.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Perhaps you might know something about this.
#unknown Perhaps.
#unknown And then again perhaps I don't, Walt.
#unknown Perhaps I smoked them in a fugue state.
#unknown I'd like an explanation, please.
#unknown You don't wanna go down that road.
#unknown Why would you do this? You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
#unknown Three and a half cigarettes won't do a thing to the baby.
#unknown Nothing.
#unknown I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.
#unknown Three and a half.
#unknown That was it.
#unknown I tossed the rest.
#unknown And I'm sure you'll be very glad to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.
#unknown Skyler, this I mean, this is something that This is so unlike you.
#unknown Why? Really? How would you know? No, thank you.
#unknown Hank.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown You asked me what I want you to do.
#unknown I want you to handle it.
#unknown
