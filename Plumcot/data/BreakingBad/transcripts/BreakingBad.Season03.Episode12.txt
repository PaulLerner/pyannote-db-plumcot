#unknown Who's tripping down   The streets of the city   Smilin' at everybody she sees?   Who's reachin' out to capture a moment  [dog barking in distance] So if it's okay, I was thinking about using this one for the test.
#unknown Mom's brakes are very sticky Hmm.
#unknown and you barely press down on them, and it's like a screech.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown But I'm good? Yeah, you're great.
#unknown Why? Um, are my feet okay? Ah.
#unknown I looked it up.
#unknown New Mexico says all I need is a note from a doctor.
#unknown I mean, I know it's not the right way and all, but once I get my provisional, I can keep working at it.
#unknown Well, as long as it gets you safely from point A to point B, then who am I to argue? Hi.
#unknown You're a sweet girl.
#unknown Yes, you are.
#unknown Yes, you are.
#unknown Yes, you are.
#unknown [whispers] I know.
#unknown I know.
#unknown [Holly coos] [car approaching] [grunts] There you go.
#unknown Here you go.
#unknown [both chuckle] All right.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Got it? Yeah.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown All right.
#unknown So 9 a.
#unknown m.
#unknown Saturday? So, which means pick me up about 8:30.
#unknown I'll be here with bells on.
#unknown What? Just a saying.
#unknown Don't worry.
#unknown I won't be wearing bells.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown Hey, Mom.
#unknown Hi.
#unknown Um, do you have a minute? Yeah.
#unknown Could you go in and keep an eye on your sister for me? Yeah, sure.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown All right.
#unknown See you, Dad.
#unknown Bye, son.
#unknown Hey, good work today.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown [sighs] [door closes] Have you thought anymore about about what we discussed? "Thought any more," meaning reconsidered? No.
#unknown So show me the flaw in it.
#unknown Uh, "flaws," Skyler.
#unknown "Flaws," plural, not singular.
#unknown [chuckles] Where do you want me to start? Hey, I don't love this situation, all right, that you put me in.
#unknown [sighs] However, let's just stick with what makes sense here.
#unknown You took the seed money.
#unknown You went gambling.
#unknown You invested it in the car wash that you helped run for four years.
#unknown You hired your wife as a bookkeeper.
#unknown Because guess what? She's actually a bookkeeper.
#unknown Now, that is a story an auditor can believe, so what am I missing? You're missing that you should just take this money that I give you and not look too closely at it, so if, God forbid, I get caught, you maintain plausible deniability.
#unknown Okay, my estranged husband who, when he was working, made $43,000 a year, starts shoveling money at me, and when the police come, I'm supposed to say, "Gee, I never thought about it, Officers.
#unknown Made sense to me.
#unknown " Really? That, in your mind, is plausible deniability? I'll tell you what, Walt.
#unknown I'd rather have them think I'm Bonnie what'shername than some complete idiot.
#unknown So you're promoting caution here.
#unknown [sighs] And you want a believable story.
#unknown That, it seems to me, is the safest way to make the best out of a very bad situation, yes.
#unknown Ah.
#unknown But I'm noting a little hole in your plot, though.
#unknown Why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you? Because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation, though it may be hopeless and futile.
#unknown Then again, he'd try anything.
#unknown I'm just not buying it.
#unknown No, I think it would be better if the husband were no longer estranged.
#unknown Mmm.
#unknown You know, maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed.
#unknown Wow.
#unknown It's suddenly a fantasy story.
#unknown I am at least going to be a part of this household.
#unknown Dinner with the family every night of the week.
#unknown Not every night, no.
#unknown Six nights a week.
#unknown You'll get one night off.
#unknown Dinner two nights, not weekends, with 24hours' notice.
#unknown Five nights a week with no notice.
#unknown Three, sixhours' notice.
#unknown Five nights a week with two hours' notice.
#unknown Four.
#unknown F Don't push it.
#unknown And I want my own key to the house.
#unknown No.
#unknown For emergencies and appearances, yes.
#unknown I am going to babysit my own daughter.
#unknown I'm going to help my son with his homework.
#unknown I am going to be a part of this family, and that is how we'll sell your little fiction.
#unknown How about we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer? Uh, no.
#unknown Thanks, though.
#unknown Maybe some other time.
#unknown No, seriously.
#unknown Get a beer with me.
#unknown What? What the hell are you doing? That's ours, right? Look at it and tell me if that's ours.
#unknown Yes, it's ours.
#unknown Now put it away.
#unknown What the hell is wrong with you? Where did you get that? Did you take it from the lab? I bought it from the two guys who killed Combo.
#unknown They had Combo shot down in the street, and now it's our product they're selling.
#unknown Which means they work for our guy.
#unknown Right? What is that? That's hearsay.
#unknown Do you have any proof? I heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him.
#unknown Hear how I just said "kid"? This kid he's 11 years old shot Combo on orders.
#unknown These two scumbags, they got him dealing.
#unknown They got him And you know he's not the first.
#unknown They use kids 'cause, hey, why not? Easy to control, easy to fool.
#unknown All they get is juvie if they ever get caught.
#unknown Hearts and minds, right? Get them young, and they're yours forever.
#unknown These guys killed Combo.
#unknown They used this little kid like some puppet.
#unknown They used him to shoot my friend.
#unknown So why are you telling me this? I need your help.
#unknown How? I need ricin.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Oh, God.
#unknown These two Hey.
#unknown No.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown They got to go.
#unknown All right? I've got the entire thing figured out No.
#unknown a delivery method, everything.
#unknown All I need from you is the poison, that's all.
#unknown No LLook, otherwise, you don't have to No  you don't have to lift a finger.
#unknown Listen, you don't even know what you're talking about.
#unknown This is not even Look, you don't get how right this is? Huh? You don't get how the whole entire world would be better off No, we're not even talking about this.
#unknown I know a woman who buys from the these two once or twice a week.
#unknown All right? She brings them hamburgers 'cause they sit in their car all day, and they get hungry, so she brings them food, and they knock a few bucks off her price.
#unknown There's your delivery system right there.
#unknown I can be a mile away.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown A methhead you're trusting to do this? You know what? That methhead stood up to your brotherinlaw.
#unknown All right? He questioned her for five hours.
#unknown She didn't give it up.
#unknown You know how it is you know? Because you're not in prison right now.
#unknown Yeah, well, I know I would be in prison after this.
#unknown Prison or worse, and I'd be right alongside you.
#unknown No Jesse, you cannot be serious.
#unknown Listen, this is a ridiculous idea.
#unknown It's ridiculous? What, so you're saying it's not going to work? How about back when it was your plan? Back when you were going to use it on Tuco? Apples and oranges.
#unknown Guy eats ricin.
#unknown Two or three days later, he gets the flu or a heart attack or something, and he keels over.
#unknown That's what you said.
#unknown Untraceable back to us.
#unknown To To me.
#unknown Not even that other scumbag we work for is ever going to figure it out.
#unknown Yo, it was a good plan back when it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now.
#unknown Tuco wanted to murder us.
#unknown These guys don't.
#unknown Apples and oranges.
#unknown Do I really have to sit here and explain the difference to you? Combo was us, man.
#unknown He was one of us.
#unknown Does that mean nothing? Why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago? Because I just found out about them.
#unknown What's to find out? It's a dispute over turf, right? I mean, how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf and kill them months ago? Because back then you were too busy getting high, feeling sorry.
#unknown Now, murder is not part of your 12step program.
#unknown This is not some amends that you have to make.
#unknown What you are talking about here is pointless.
#unknown This achieves nothing.
#unknown It accomplishes nothing.
#unknown If you don't see what it accomplishes, then there's no way I can explain it to you.
#unknown Jesse, listen to me.
#unknown You are not a murderer.
#unknown I'm not, and you're not.
#unknown It's as simple as that.
#unknown Jesse I'm doing it with or without you.
#unknown Knock, knock.
#unknown Christ sakes, Marie, you don't say "knock, knock.
#unknown " You Like that.
#unknown Well, I like saying it.
#unknown Yeah, well, that's not the rules.
#unknown Okay? Listen, you knock your way, Groucho.
#unknown I'll knock mine.
#unknown But, look, see? I win.
#unknown Not so fast.
#unknown Christ, again? That's three in a row.
#unknown Frickin' Paul Newman over here? Have you been playing cards with your dad? No, why? How is your old man? He back teaching? No, I don't think either of them are working right right now.
#unknown Yeah? How they swinging that? Hey.
#unknown Did you know that the doctor has told your Uncle Hank that he can get out of here any time he wants to.
#unknown Oh, yeah? That's great.
#unknown Yeah, well, we're not so sure about that.
#unknown Why not? What? That's what they said.
#unknown That's what they said because they want the room.
#unknown They hit the sheets with Lysol, reset the meter, and wheel the next slob in here.
#unknown We went over this, Marie.
#unknown Drop it.
#unknown Are you not well enough? Jesus, kid, you, too? Do I look well enough? I'm shitting in pants, peeing in pitchers.
#unknown Can't move my legs.
#unknown Got it? So people in wheelchairs should be in hospitals? What about people on crutches? Maybe I should be in here, too.
#unknown Is that what you're trying to say? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
#unknown Deal, you little perk.
#unknown [sighs] [sighs] Bitch.
#unknown You know I'm hourly, right? He promised me he'd be here.
#unknown Oh, he promised, huh? Well, why didn't you tell me? Let's wait, then.
#unknown That's a joke.
#unknown The kid ain't coming.
#unknown Okay, so what's Plan B? I don't know.
#unknown I really don't.
#unknown Well, let's brainstorm.
#unknown You really think he's serious? That's why I'm here, Saul.
#unknown The way he was talking, he is going to do it.
#unknown Or try, at least.
#unknown Okay, so, what, we pay him off.
#unknown No.
#unknown No, it's not about money.
#unknown It's about getting him off the streets, getting him to calm down.
#unknown Maybe What if we maybe Could you get him arrested? [laughs] You You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? No, now, listen.
#unknown I know it sounds risky, but it wouldn't be anything that would get him into real trouble and nothing that could lead back to our business.
#unknown Just some minor offense.
#unknown [laughs] Pinkman in jail I don't know.
#unknown I'm picturing it and No, not in jail as in "jail" jail.
#unknown I'm talking about one of those situations where you're in an orange jumpsuit picking up litter along the highway.
#unknown That's jail.
#unknown You're talking about a leveltwo joint.
#unknown Something that keeps him off the street for, say, 30 days.
#unknown Then by the time he gets out, tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on.
#unknown Well, Roswell Correctional's pretty low impact.
#unknown In the past I've recommended Springer, but hearing chancy things about their bathrooms since they renovated, so So it's possible, right? Yeah, well, it falls under my premiumservices package, but you can afford that.
#unknown I'll call my P.
#unknown I.
#unknown [Jesse] You understand what you have to do? You can never talk to anyone.
#unknown Right? I mean, ever.
#unknown Understand? Yeah.
#unknown I found this stuff on the Internet.
#unknown Takes days to kick in.
#unknown Just keep quiet, and this won't ever come back to you.
#unknown You're okay with this, right? Just think of it like it's the same thing as always.
#unknown You're just delivering some hamburgers.
#unknown It's not just delivering hamburgers.
#unknown Hey, you got a kid.
#unknown Right? What's his name? Patrick.
#unknown Imagine these two guys and Patrick working as a mule, making him kill people.
#unknown Wouldn't you do anything to protect your kid? Of course I would.
#unknown I do all kinds of things for him.
#unknown Okay, so these guys using kids like that, they got to go.
#unknown Right? Good.
#unknown Tomorrow.
#unknown I'll be in touch.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Bet that tastes good, huh? [chomping] [knock on door] Yeah.
#unknown Come here.
#unknown Okay, here we go.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown [coos] What are you doing? If you need to talk, use the phone.
#unknown This isn't a phone talk, Walter.
#unknown Your wife's out, right? Aw.
#unknown [chuckles] Isn't she something? I got a granddaughter a few years older.
#unknown What can I do for you? [grumbles] Have a seat, Walter.
#unknown I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.
#unknown And? I'm not going to do it.
#unknown Why? Because it's moronic.
#unknown Saul said you've done things like this before.
#unknown That's not the moronic part.
#unknown Okay, so what's the problem? The problem is the boss wouldn't like it.
#unknown Saul? My boss.
#unknown Your boss.
#unknown This is a professional courtesy.
#unknown No one knows I'm here.
#unknown Understand? But our employer would find out, like always, and if Pinkman were arrested, he'd take it as a problem.
#unknown Walt, you got a good thing going here.
#unknown We all do.
#unknown You want to risk it all on one junkie? Now, I realize you two have a history, but this kid's been on the bubble a while now.
#unknown It's a long time coming.
#unknown What is? Um I used to be a beat cop, long time ago, and I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time.
#unknown Hundreds, probably, over the years.
#unknown But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit that I will never forget.
#unknown Gordie.
#unknown He looked like Bo Svenson.
#unknown You remember him? Walking Tall? You don't remember? No.
#unknown Anyway big boy 270, 280, but his wife or whatever she was his lady was real small, like a bird, wrists like little branches.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown Anyway, my partner and I get called out there every weekend, and one of us would pull her aside and we'd say, "Come on, tonight's the night we press charges.
#unknown " And this wasn't one of those "deep down he really loves me" setups.
#unknown We got a lot of those, but not this.
#unknown This girl was scared.
#unknown She wasn't going to cross him no way, no how.
#unknown Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMTs, put him in the car, drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank.
#unknown He sleeps it off.
#unknown Next morning, out he goes back home.
#unknown But one night my partner's out sick, and it's just me.
#unknown And the call comes in, and it's the usual crap brokennoseintheshower kind of thing.
#unknown So I cuff him, put him in the car, and away we go.
#unknown Only that night we're driving into town, and this sideways asshole is in my back seat humming "Danny Boy.
#unknown " [chuckles] And it just rubbed me wrong.
#unknown So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere.
#unknown And I kneel him down, and I put my revolver in his mouth, and I told him, "This is it.
#unknown This is how it ends.
#unknown " And he's crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he's going to leave her alone, screaming as much as you can with a gun in your mouth.
#unknown And I told him to be quiet 'cause I need to think about what I was gong to do here.
#unknown And of course he got quiet.
#unknown Goes still.
#unknown And real quiet.
#unknown Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.
#unknown Then we just stood there for a while.
#unknown Me acting like I'm thinking things over, and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants.
#unknown And after a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth, and I say, "So help me, if you ever touch her again, "I will such and such and such and such and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
#unknown " Just a warning? [chuckles] Of course.
#unknown Just trying to do the right thing.
#unknown But two weeks later he killed her.
#unknown Of course.
#unknown Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender.
#unknown We got there, there was so much blood, you could taste the metal.
#unknown Hmm.
#unknown The moral of the story is I chose a half measure when I should have gone all the way.
#unknown I'll never make that mistake again.
#unknown No more half measures, Walter.
#unknown [Jesse] Man, I don't get this.
#unknown I don't get this at all.
#unknown All I'm seeing is the kid.
#unknown So where are they? [sighs] I don't know.
#unknown They're always around.
#unknown Burgers are getting cold.
#unknown So is it, like, fast? Don't sweat it, all right? You're just doing what you do.
#unknown Nobody's going to know anything.
#unknown Can I have another bump? You had your bump.
#unknown We get this thing done.
#unknown Then you can have all you want.
#unknown [knock on window] Going to need you to come with me.
#unknown Take a walk.
#unknown Where are we going? Sit down.
#unknown I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees.
#unknown It is true that they killed one of your associates.
#unknown It is possible they acted rashly, but, on the other hand, there was provocation.
#unknown A man was selling on their territory.
#unknown There is blame on both sides.
#unknown This will go no further.
#unknown It will be settled right here, right now.
#unknown You told him.
#unknown Wait outside.
#unknown Listen to me.
#unknown You have one friend in this room.
#unknown This man.
#unknown Those men outside are my trusted employees, and when I learned what you intended to do If it wasn't for this man and the respect I have for him, I would be dealing with this in a very different way.
#unknown You don't look at him.
#unknown You look at me.
#unknown This is what happens now.
#unknown My men will come back inside, and you will shake their hands and you will make peace.
#unknown And that will be the end of this.
#unknown No.
#unknown Jesse Pardon me? They use kids.
#unknown These assholes of yours, they got an 11yearold kid doing their killing for them.
#unknown You're supposed to be some kind of reasonable businessman.
#unknown This how you do business? You okay with this? You got anything to say here? Bring them back.
#unknown No more children.
#unknown Understand? And you.
#unknown You keep the peace.
#unknown Say it.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown I'll keep the peace.
#unknown Shake hands.
#unknown Jesse, your actions they affect other people.
#unknown And sometimes compromises have to be made for the best of reasons.
#unknown No, Jesse.
#unknown Jesse! [mutters] Marie, let the people who get paid to do this, do this.
#unknown The people who get paid to do this, do a lousy job.
#unknown So I guess this is what you want, huh? Just lying in a hospital bed, getting sponge baths from nurses.
#unknown Marie.
#unknown It's time to go home, Hank.
#unknown How many times I got to tell you, Marie? Not till I'm well.
#unknown [stammering] Hey, what are you doing? I'm just seeing.
#unknown Seeing what? Seeing what I see.
#unknown I'm not at my best here, Marie.
#unknown We'll see.
#unknown Nothing's going to happen.
#unknown I say it will.
#unknown Nuhuh.
#unknown I'm in this bed for a reason.
#unknown Well, it's a waste of time.
#unknown Besides, what if someone comes in? Let them.
#unknown I don't care if someone walks in.
#unknown Marie, what's wrong with you? I'll tell you what.
#unknown If I can get the groundhog to see his shadow It's not going to happen.
#unknown I'm sorry.
#unknown I'm betting it will, and if he does, you check out of here.
#unknown [chuckles] I'm not going to bet on whether I get a boner.
#unknown It's not bet.
#unknown There's no bet here.
#unknown No bet.
#unknown You afraid you'll lose? You know what? You're just You're just being foolish, you know? Come on.
#unknown What's the point? The point is you're not completely hopeless.
#unknown We have a bet? You know what? If it'll get you out of here quicker, you got one minute.
#unknown One minute? [chuckles] Yeah.
#unknown All right.
#unknown That's a cakewalk.
#unknown Yeah, this is just It's just sad.
#unknown I mean I really feel sorry for you, Marie, you know? I really do.
#unknown It's just It's [chuckles] pathetic.
#unknown That's okay.
#unknown Keep talking.
#unknown Protest.
#unknown Struggle.
#unknown Marie, give up.
#unknown I mean, seriously, it's not going to happen.
#unknown [sighs] [chuckles] [Woman on P.

#unknown Dr.
#unknown Kravitz, a visitor in the main lobby.

#unknown Police have yet to release a statement, but sources indicate that 11yearold Tomas Cantillo may have been the victim of a gangrelated execution.
#unknown An anonymous tip brought police to a playground on the 4700 block of 8th Avenue late last night.
#unknown Paramedics were called to the scene but were unable to revive the boy.
#unknown A gruesome crime, a shocking loss Can you turn that off? and yet another casualty in what appears to be the city's ongoing struggle Walt? against drugs and the gangs that peddle them.
