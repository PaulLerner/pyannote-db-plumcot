wendy  a moment? Everyone knows it's Windy Hey, guys.
walter_white_jr.  So if it's okay, I was thinking about using this one for the test.
walter_white_jr.  Mom's brakes are very sticky Hmm. and you barely press down on them, and it's like a screech.
walter_white_jr.  But I'm good?
walter_white_jr.  you're great. Why? Um, are my feet okay?
walter_white_jr.  I looked
walter_white_jr.  it up. New Mexico says all I need is a note from a doctor.
walter_white_jr.  I mean, I know it's not the right way and all, but once I get my provisional, I can keep working at it.
walter_white  Well, as long as it gets you safely from point A to point B, then who am I to argue? Hi. You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. whispers I know
walter_white  I know. Holly coos car approaching grunts There you go. Here you go. both
walter_white_jr.  both chuckle All right. Thank you.
walter_white  Got
walter_white  it?
walter_white_jr.  Yeah
walter_white  Okay
walter_white  Okay.
walter_white_jr.  So 9 a. m. Saturday
walter_white  Saturday? So
walter_white_jr.  So, which means pick me up about 8:30.
walter_white  I'll be here with bells on.
walter_white_jr.  What
walter_white  What? Just a saying.
walter_white  Don't worry. I won't be wearing bells.
skyler_white  Hey.
walter_white_jr.  Hey, Mom.
skyler_white  Hi. Um
skyler_white  do you have a minute?
walter_white  Yeah. Could
skyler_white  Could you go in and keep an eye on your sister for me?
walter_white_jr.  Yeah, sure.
skyler_white  Thanks
walter_white_jr.  Thanks. All right
skyler_white  Bye, son.
skyler_white  Hey, good work today.
walter_white_jr.  Thank you.
skyler_white  Have you thought anymore about about what we discussed?
walter_white  Thought any more," meaning reconsidered?
skyler_white  So show me the flaw in it
walter_white " flaws," Skyler."
walter_white  Flaws,"
walter_white  plural, not singular.
walter_white  Where do you want me to start?
skyler_white  Hey, I don't love this situation, all right, that you put me in.
skyler_white  However, let's just stick with what makes sense here.
skyler_white  took the seed money. You went gambling. You invested it in the car wash that you helped run for four years.
skyler_white  You hired your wife as a bookkeeper. Because guess what? She's actually a bookkeeper.
skyler_white  Now, that is a story an auditor can believe,
skyler_white  so what am I missing? You're
walter_white  You're missing that you should just take this money that I give you and not look too closely at it
walter_white  so if, God forbid, I get caught, you maintain plausible deniability.
skyler_white  Okay, my estranged husband who, when he was working, made $43,000 a year, starts shoveling money at me,
skyler_white  and when the police come, I'm supposed to say,
skyler_white  I never thought about it, Officers. Made
skyler_white  Made sense to me."
skyler_white  Really?
skyler_white  That, in your mind, is plausible deniability?
skyler_white  I'll tell you what, Walt. I'd rather have them think I'm Bonnie what'shername than some complete idiot.
walter_white  So you're promoting caution here.
walter_white  And you want a believable story.
skyler_white  That, it seems to me, is the safest way to make the best out of a very bad situation, yes.
walter_white  But I'm noting a little hole in your plot, though.
walter_white  Why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you?
skyler_white  Because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation, though it may be hopeless and futile.
skyler_white  Then again, he'd try anything.
walter_white  I'm just not buying it.
walter_white  No, I think it would be better if the husband were no longer estranged.
walter_white  maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed.
skyler_white  It's suddenly a fantasy story.
walter_white  I am at least going to be a part of this household.
walter_white  Dinner with the family every night of the week.
skyler_white  Not every night, no.
walter_white  Six nights a week.
walter_white  You'll get one night off.
skyler_white  Dinner two nights, not
skyler_white  not weekends,
skyler_white  with 24hours' notice. Five
walter_white  Five nights a week with no notice
skyler_white  Three,
skyler_white  sixhours' notice.
walter_white  Five nights a week with two hours' notice. Four
skyler_white  Four.
skyler_white  Don't push it.
walter_white  And I want my own key to the house.
skyler_white  No.
walter_white  For emergencies and appearances, yes.
walter_white  I am going to babysit my own daughter. I'm going to help my son with his homework.
walter_white  I am going to be a part of this family,
walter_white  and that is how we'll sell your little fiction.
jesse_pinkman  about we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer?
walter_white  no. Thanks
walter_white  Thanks, though.
walter_white  Maybe some other time.
jesse_pinkman  seriously.
jesse_pinkman  Get a beer with me.
walter_white  What the hell are you doing?
jesse_pinkman  That's ours, right?
jesse_pinkman  Look at it and tell me if that's ours.
walter_white  Yes, it's ours.
walter_white  Now put it away.
walter_white  What the hell is wrong with you?
walter_white  Where did you get that?
walter_white  Did you take it from the lab?
jesse_pinkman  I bought it from the two guys who killed Combo.
jesse_pinkman  They had Combo shot down in the street, and now it's our product they're selling.
jesse_pinkman  means they work for our
walter_white  Right
walter_white  What is that? That's
walter_white  That's hearsay.
walter_white  Do you have any proof?
jesse_pinkman  I heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him
jesse_pinkman  Hear how I just said" kid"? This kid
jesse_pinkman  he's 11 years old
jesse_pinkman  shot Combo on orders.
jesse_pinkman  These two scumbags, they got him dealing.
jesse_pinkman  They got
jesse_pinkman  you know he's not the first.
jesse_pinkman  They use kids 'cause, hey, why not?
jesse_pinkman  Easy to control,
jesse_pinkman  to fool.
jesse_pinkman  All they get is juvie if they ever get caught.
jesse_pinkman  Hearts and minds, right? Get
jesse_pinkman  them young, and they're yours forever
jesse_pinkman  These guys killed Combo. They
jesse_pinkman  They used this little kid like some puppet.
jesse_pinkman  They used him to shoot my friend.
walter_white  So why are you telling me this?
walter_white  I
jesse_pinkman  I need ricin.
walter_white  Oh,
walter_white  These two Hey.
jesse_pinkman  No.
jesse_pinkman  Hey
walter_white  Hey.
jesse_pinkman  They got to go.
jesse_pinkman  right? I've got the entire
walter_white  entire thing
jesse_pinkman  figured out No.
jesse_pinkman  a delivery method, everything. All I need from you
walter_white  you is
jesse_pinkman  the poison
jesse_pinkman  No LLook, otherwise, you don't have to No you don't have
walter_white  to lift a finger. Listen
walter_white  Listen, you don't even know what you're talking about.
walter_white  is not even Look
jesse_pinkman  Look, you don't get how right this is?
jesse_pinkman  You don't get how the whole entire
walter_white  entire world would be better off No, we're not even talking about this.
jesse_pinkman  I know a woman who buys from the these two once or twice a week.
jesse_pinkman  right? She brings them hamburgers 'cause they sit in their car all day, and they get hungry, so she brings them food, and they knock a few bucks off her price.
jesse_pinkman  There's your delivery system right there
jesse_pinkman  I can be a mile away.
walter_white  Jesus.
walter_white  A methhead you're trusting to do this?
jesse_pinkman  You know what? That
jesse_pinkman  That methhead stood up to your brotherinlaw. All
jesse_pinkman  He questioned her for five hours.
jesse_pinkman  She didn't give it up.
jesse_pinkman  know how it
jesse_pinkman  is you know? Because you're not in prison right now.
walter_white  well, I know I would be in prison after this.
walter_white  Prison or worse,
walter_white  I'd be right alongside you.
walter_white  No Jesse, you cannot be serious.
walter_white  Listen, this is a ridiculous idea.
jesse_pinkman  It's ridiculous?
jesse_pinkman  so you're saying it's not going to work?
jesse_pinkman  about back when it was your plan?
jesse_pinkman  when you were going to use it on Tuco?
walter_white  Apples and oranges.
jesse_pinkman  Guy eats ricin. Two or three days later, he gets the flu or a heart attack or something, and he keels over. That's
jesse_pinkman  That's what you said.
jesse_pinkman  Untraceable back to us.
jesse_pinkman  To me. Not even that other scumbag we work for is ever going to figure it out.
jesse_pinkman  it was a good plan back when it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now
walter_white  Tuco wanted to murder us.
walter_white  These guys don't.
walter_white  Apples and oranges.
walter_white  Do I really have to sit here and explain the difference to you?
jesse_pinkman  Combo was us, man. He
jesse_pinkman  one of us
jesse_pinkman  Does that
walter_white  nothing? Why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago?
jesse_pinkman  Because I just found out about them
walter_white  What's to find out?
walter_white  It's a dispute over turf, right?
walter_white  I mean, how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf and kill them months ago
walter_white  Because back then you were too busy getting high, feeling sorry.
walter_white  Now, murder is not part of your 12step program.
walter_white  This is not some amends that you have to make.
walter_white  What you are talking about here is pointless.
walter_white  This achieves nothing.
walter_white  It accomplishes nothing.
jesse_pinkman  If you don't see what it accomplishes, then there's no way I can explain it to you. Jesse, listen to me.
walter_white  You
walter_white  You are not a murderer.
walter_white  I'm not, and you're not.
walter_white  It's as simple as that.
jesse_pinkman  Jesse
hank_schrader  Christ sakes, Marie, you don't say" knock, knock." You Like that.
marie_schrader  Well, I like saying it.
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, that's not the rules.
hank_schrader  Okay?
marie_schrader  Listen, you knock your way, Groucho. I'll knock mine.
marie_schrader  But, look, see?
marie_schrader  I win.
walter_white_jr.  Not so fast. Christ,
hank_schrader  again? That's
hank_schrader  three in a row.
hank_schrader  Frickin' Paul Newman over here?
marie_schrader  Have you been playing cards with your dad?
walter_white_jr.  No,
walter_white_jr.  why?
hank_schrader  How is your old man?
hank_schrader  He back teaching?
walter_white_jr.  I don't think either of them are working right right now. Yeah
hank_schrader  Yeah? How they swinging that
marie_schrader  Hey. Did you know that the doctor has told your Uncle Hank that he can get out of here any time he wants to.
walter_white_jr.  Oh, yeah?
walter_white_jr.  That's great.
hank_schrader  Yeah, well, we're not so sure about that
walter_white_jr.  Why not?
marie_schrader  What? That's
marie_schrader  That's what they said.
hank_schrader  That's what they said because they want the room.
hank_schrader  They hit the sheets with Lysol, reset the meter, and wheel the next slob in here.
hank_schrader  We went over this, Marie.
hank_schrader  Drop it.
walter_white_jr.  Are you not well enough?
hank_schrader  Jesus, kid, you, too?
hank_schrader  Do I look well enough
hank_schrader  shitting in pants, peeing in pitchers.
hank_schrader  Can't move my legs.
walter_white_jr.  So people in wheelchairs should be in hospitals?
walter_white_jr.  What about people on crutches?
walter_white_jr.  Maybe I should be in here, too.
walter_white_jr.  that what you're trying to say?
hank_schrader  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
hank_schrader  Deal, you little perk.
saul_goodman  You know I'm hourly, right?
walter_white  promised me he'd be here.
saul_goodman  Oh, he promised, huh? Well
saul_goodman  didn't you tell me?
saul_goodman  Let's wait, then.
saul_goodman  That's a joke.
saul_goodman  The kid ain't coming.
saul_goodman  Okay, so what's Plan B?
walter_white  I don't
walter_white  I really don't.
saul_goodman  Well, let's brainstorm.
saul_goodman  You really think he's serious?
walter_white  That's why I'm here, Saul.
walter_white  way he was talking, he is going to do it
walter_white  Or try, at least.
saul_goodman  Okay, so, what, we pay him off.
walter_white  No. No, it's not about money.
walter_white  It's about getting him off the streets,
walter_white  getting him to calm down.
walter_white  if we maybe Could
walter_white  him arrested
saul_goodman  You You want your criminal associate taken into police custody?
walter_white  No, now, listen.
walter_white  I know it sounds risky,
walter_white  but it wouldn't be anything that would get him into real trouble and nothing that could lead back to our business.
walter_white  Just some minor offense.
saul_goodman  Pinkman in jail I
saul_goodman  I don't know.
saul_goodman  I'm picturing it
walter_white  it and No, not in jail as in" jail" jail.
walter_white  talking about one of those situations where you're in an orange jumpsuit picking up litter along the highway.
saul_goodman  That's jail.
saul_goodman  You're talking about a leveltwo joint. Something
walter_white  Something that keeps him off the street for, say, 30 days.
walter_white  Then by the time he gets out, tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on.
saul_goodman  Well, Roswell Correctional's pretty low impact.
saul_goodman  In the past I've recommended Springer, but hearing chancy things about their bathrooms since they renovated,
walter_white  So it's possible, right?
saul_goodman  well, it falls under my premiumservices package, but you can afford that.
saul_goodman  I'll call my P.
jesse_pinkman  You understand what you have to do?
jesse_pinkman  to anyone. Right
jesse_pinkman  I mean, ever. Understand? Yeah. I found this stuff on the Internet. Takes days to kick in. Just keep quiet,
jesse_pinkman  come back to
jesse_pinkman  to you
jesse_pinkman  you. You're okay with this, right?
jesse_pinkman  Just think of it like it's the same thing as always. You're
jesse_pinkman  You're just delivering some hamburgers.
wendy  It's not just delivering hamburgers.
jesse_pinkman  got a kid. Right?
jesse_pinkman  What's his name?
wendy  Patrick.
jesse_pinkman  Imagine these two guys and Patrick working as a mule,
jesse_pinkman  making him kill people.
jesse_pinkman  Wouldn't you do anything to protect your kid?
wendy  I would.
wendy  I do all kinds of things for him
jesse_pinkman  Okay, so these guys using kids like that,
jesse_pinkman  Right
jesse_pinkman  be in touch.
walter_white  Bet that tastes good, huh?
walter_white  What are you doing?
walter_white  If you need to talk, use the phone.
mike_ehrmantraut  This isn't a phone talk, Walter.
mike_ehrmantraut  Your wife's out, right?
mike_ehrmantraut  something? I
mike_ehrmantraut  I got a granddaughter a few years older.
walter_white  What can I do for you?
mike_ehrmantraut  Have a seat, Walter.
mike_ehrmantraut  I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.
mike_ehrmantraut  I'm not going to do it.
walter_white  Why?
mike_ehrmantraut  Because it's moronic.
walter_white  Saul said you've done things like this before.
mike_ehrmantraut  That's not the moronic part.
walter_white  Okay,
walter_white  so what's the problem?
mike_ehrmantraut  The problem is the boss wouldn't like it
walter_white  Saul?
mike_ehrmantraut  My boss.
mike_ehrmantraut  Your boss.
mike_ehrmantraut  This is a professional courtesy.
mike_ehrmantraut  No one knows I'm here.
mike_ehrmantraut  Understand?
mike_ehrmantraut  But our employer would find out, like always,
mike_ehrmantraut  and if Pinkman were arrested, he'd take it as a problem.
mike_ehrmantraut  Walt, you got a good thing going here.
mike_ehrmantraut  We all do.
mike_ehrmantraut  You want to risk it all on one junkie?
mike_ehrmantraut  Now, I realize you two have a history, but this kid's been on the bubble a while now.
mike_ehrmantraut  It's a long time coming.
mike_ehrmantraut  used to be a beat cop, long time ago,
mike_ehrmantraut  and I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time.
mike_ehrmantraut  Hundreds, probably, over the years.
mike_ehrmantraut  But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit that I will never forget.
mike_ehrmantraut  Gordie.
mike_ehrmantraut  He looked like Bo Svenson. You
mike_ehrmantraut  You remember him?
mike_ehrmantraut  Walking Tall?
mike_ehrmantraut  You don't remember?
walter_white  Anyway
mike_ehrmantraut  Anyway big boy 270, 280, but his wife or whatever she was his lady was real small
mike_ehrmantraut  like a bird, wrists
mike_ehrmantraut  wrists like little branches.
mike_ehrmantraut  Anyway, my partner and I get called out there every weekend, and one of us would pull her aside and we'd say,
mike_ehrmantraut " Come on, tonight's the night we press charges.
mike_ehrmantraut  And this wasn't one of those" deep down he really loves me" setups.
mike_ehrmantraut  We got a lot of those, but not this.
mike_ehrmantraut  This girl was scared.
mike_ehrmantraut  She wasn't going to cross him no
mike_ehrmantraut  no way, no
mike_ehrmantraut  how. Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMTs, put him in the car, drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank.
mike_ehrmantraut  He sleeps it off. Next morning, out he goes
mike_ehrmantraut  back home.
mike_ehrmantraut  But one night my partner's out sick, and it's just me.
mike_ehrmantraut  And the call comes in, and it's the usual crap
mike_ehrmantraut  brokennoseintheshower kind of thing. So
mike_ehrmantraut  So I cuff him, put him in the car, and away we go.
mike_ehrmantraut  Only that night we're driving into town, and this sideways asshole is in my back seat humming" Danny Boy.
mike_ehrmantraut  And it just rubbed me wrong.
mike_ehrmantraut  So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere.
mike_ehrmantraut  And I kneel him down, and I put my revolver in his mouth, and I told him," This is it.
mike_ehrmantraut  This is how it ends.
mike_ehrmantraut  And he's crying, going to the bathroom all over himself,
mike_ehrmantraut  swearing to God he's going to leave her alone, screaming
mike_ehrmantraut  screaming as much as you can with a gun in your mouth.
mike_ehrmantraut  And I told him to be quiet 'cause
mike_ehrmantraut  I need to think about what I was gong to do here
mike_ehrmantraut  And of course he got quiet. Goes still. And real quiet.
mike_ehrmantraut  Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.
mike_ehrmantraut  we just stood there for a
mike_ehrmantraut  while. Me acting like I'm thinking things over, and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants.
mike_ehrmantraut  a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth, and I say," So help me, if you ever touch her again," I will such and such and such and such and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
walter_white  Just a warning?
mike_ehrmantraut  chuckles Of course.
mike_ehrmantraut  Just trying to do the right thing.
mike_ehrmantraut  But two weeks later he killed her.
mike_ehrmantraut  Of course.
mike_ehrmantraut  Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender.
mike_ehrmantraut  We got there, there was so much blood, you could taste the metal.
mike_ehrmantraut  moral of the story is I chose a half measure when I should have gone all the way.
mike_ehrmantraut  I'll never make that mistake again.
mike_ehrmantraut  No more half measures, Walter.
jesse_pinkman  I don't get this at all
jesse_pinkman  All I'm seeing is the kid.
jesse_pinkman  they? sighs
wendy  know.
wendy  They're always around.
jesse_pinkman  Burgers are getting cold.
wendy  So is it, like, fast?
jesse_pinkman  Don't sweat it, all right? You're
jesse_pinkman  You're just doing what you do.
jesse_pinkman  Nobody's going to know anything.
wendy  Can I have another bump?
jesse_pinkman  You had your bump.
jesse_pinkman  We get this thing done. Then you can have all you want.
mike_ehrmantraut  knock on window Going to need you to come with me.
victor  Take a walk.
jesse_pinkman  Where are we going?
gustavo_fring  Sit down.
gustavo_fring  I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees.
gustavo_fring  It is true that they killed one of your associates.
gustavo_fring  It is possible they acted rashly,
gustavo_fring  but, on the other hand, there was provocation.
gustavo_fring  A man was selling
gustavo_fring  There is blame on both sides.
gustavo_fring  This will go no further.
gustavo_fring  It will be settled right here, right now.
jesse_pinkman  You
gustavo_fring  Listen to me.
gustavo_fring  You have one friend in this
gustavo_fring  room.
gustavo_fring  Those men outside are my trusted employees,
gustavo_fring  and when I learned what you intended to do
gustavo_fring  If it wasn't for this man and the respect I have for him, I would be dealing with this in a very different way.
gustavo_fring  You don't look at him.
gustavo_fring  You look at me.
gustavo_fring  This is what happens now
gustavo_fring  My men will come back inside, and you will shake their hands and you will make peace.
gustavo_fring  And that will be the end of this
jesse_pinkman  No.
walter_white  Jesse Pardon
gustavo_fring  They
jesse_pinkman  They use kids.
jesse_pinkman  These assholes of yours, they got an 11yearold kid doing their killing for them
jesse_pinkman  You're supposed to be some kind of reasonable businessman.
jesse_pinkman  This how you do business?
jesse_pinkman  You okay with this?
jesse_pinkman  You got anything to say here?
gustavo_fring  Bring them back.
gustavo_fring  And you. You keep the peace.
jesse_pinkman  I'll keep the peace.
walter_white  Jesse, your actions they affect other people.
walter_white  sometimes compromises have to be made for the best of reasons.
walter_white  Jesse.
