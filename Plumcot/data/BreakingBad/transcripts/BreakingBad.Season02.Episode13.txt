#unknown Are you listening? Everything is gonna be okay.
#unknown I promise.
#unknown No, no Listen.
#unknown Calm down.
#unknown Just.
#unknown Sit tight.
#unknown I know who to call.
#unknown Saul Goodman sent me.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Inside.
#unknown Watch the door.
#unknown Where is she? Any other drugs in the house? Think hard.
#unknown Your freedom depends on it.
#unknown What about guns? You got any guns in the house? Here's your story.
#unknown You woke up.
#unknown You found her.
#unknown That's all you know.
#unknown Say it.

#unknown Once you call, the people who show up will be with the Office of Medical lnvestigations.
#unknown That's primarily who you'll talk to.
#unknown Police officers may arrive, they may not.
#unknown Depends on how busy a morning they're having.
#unknown Typically, ODs are not a highpriority call.
#unknown There's nothing to incriminate you so I'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest.
#unknown However, if you do, you say nothing.
#unknown You tell them you just want your lawyer.
#unknown Then you call Saul Goodman.
#unknown And do I need to state the obvious? I was not here.
#unknown You put on a longsleeved shirt and cover those track marks on your arm.
#unknown Count down from 20, and then you dial.
#unknown Hang tough.
#unknown You're in the home stretch.
#unknown Do you want 2percent or skim? Two.
#unknown Two.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Junior.
#unknown Junior.
#unknown Flynn.
#unknown What? Flynn.

#unknown I'll be there in a minute.
#unknown You all right? Flynn, get your butt in here.
#unknown Oh, my God.
#unknown Mom, Dad, come here.
#unknown You gotta see this.
#unknown Seriously.
#unknown What? Look right there.
#unknown Look at that.
#unknown Are those donations? Yes.
#unknown Actual donations for your dad? Total strangers gave us $490.
#unknown Twentysix people.
#unknown Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.
#unknown Look at this one.
#unknown Vancouver.
#unknown All the way up in Canada.
#unknown And it's all real, actual money.
#unknown It's actually right there in the PayPal account.
#unknown And look what they're saying.
#unknown "Hang in there, Walt.
#unknown " "Good luck.
#unknown " "Hang in there.
#unknown " Isn't this awesome? That's Wow, that is something.
#unknown Walt, don't you think a little thankyou is in order? Yes, absolutely.
#unknown Thank you, son.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown This is a big, big help.
#unknown Oh, look, 20 more bucks from Thunder Bay, Ontario.
#unknown Damn.
#unknown Five hundred and ten dollars.
#unknown Ifyou're trying to sell me something, I've got four words for you: "Donotcall list.
#unknown " However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep.
#unknown How did I know you wouldn't be answering your phone? I'm on my way.
#unknown I'm gonna be there momentarily.
#unknown I expect you on the porch, bag packed, ready to go.
#unknown No excuses.
#unknown Sir, you may not wanna be here for this.
#unknown I just woke up and I found her.
#unknown That's all I know.
#unknown What's her date of birth? Sir, your daughter's date of birth? April.
#unknown April 4th, 1982.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown And mother's maiden name and place of birth.
#unknown My mother? Your daughter's mother.
#unknown Bishop.
#unknown And place of birth? Phoenix.
#unknown Phoenix, Arizona? This is our address.
#unknown Do you have someone who can drive you? I can drive.
#unknown Well, then if you'd like to meet us there we can complete the intake and take our samples and then you can make your arrangements.
#unknown Okay? Now, do you need a card? Will you both be coming? I don't believe it.
#unknown Walt, you have to see this.
#unknown Forty from Te Terre Haute.
#unknown Walt.
#unknown It's me.
#unknown Are you there? Hello.
#unknown I'm just checking in.
#unknown Our friend says he thinks everything went well.
#unknown That's That's good.
#unknown So listen.
#unknown Just call me, all right? Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
#unknown We just broke a thousand dollars.
#unknown All right.
#unknown I'm coming.
#unknown Some of you already know my brotherinlaw.
#unknown He's a good man.
#unknown The doctors say this operation has a real chance of helping him.
#unknown They're also saying they wanna be paid in private islands, so dig deep.
#unknown Biggest donation gets a sixpack of my very own Schraderbrau.
#unknown Homebrewed to silky perfection.
#unknown Smallest donation gets two sixpacks.
#unknown All right.
#unknown Other than Gomie here pees sitting down here's what we know.
#unknown Christian Ortega, a.
#unknown k.
#unknown a.
#unknown Combo.
#unknown Shot dead by an unknown assailant last month.
#unknown "Combo?" I hear you say.
#unknown "Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
#unknown Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?" No.
#unknown He was a dipshit wannabe banger.
#unknown Now, no arrests, save for stealing a baby Jesus from a Knights of Columbus manger back when he was 17.
#unknown This dude was so lowrep, he never showed up on our radar.
#unknown So why am I talking about him? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? He was dealing Blue Sky.
#unknown That's right.
#unknown Now, how is it that the purest, most professional grade of meth we've ever come across is being slung by the likes of that? But wait.
#unknown It gets better.
#unknown Since babyJesus thief there slowed a bullet with his neck the blue stuff's vanished from town, okay? Not a speck to be found in Albuquerque.
#unknown Now, why is that? Well, because maybe your Heisenberg's in prison.
#unknown So says A.
#unknown P.
#unknown D.
#unknown They think they got their man.
#unknown I know you don't buy it, but maybe it's true.
#unknown James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
#unknown A.
#unknown P.
#unknown D.
#unknown thinks this is our mastermind.
#unknown You believe that, I got a bridge to sell you.
#unknown He copped to it, didn't he? For an extra pudding cup every night at Los Lunas? Maybe if you give him a pack of cigarettes he'll tell you what he did with Jimmy Hoffa.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown I've been thinking.
#unknown Topshelf product like this? It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.
#unknown Raw talent's bound to pop up somewhere.
#unknown It's like WhackAMole.
#unknown So I've been making phone calls.
#unknown Local police departments, smalltown sheriffs.
#unknown Haven't had much luck inside the Land of Enchantment.
#unknown But outside, I've got reports of the blue stuff making a scene here in Texas, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
#unknown In fact, everywhere but here.
#unknown Almost as if somebody wised up, stopped shitting where they eat.
#unknown Now I say Heisenberg's still out there.
#unknown I say he's gone regional.
#unknown Only he's still right here in town.
#unknown Come on, 2800.
#unknown Come on, big 28.
#unknown You can do it.
#unknown Only 30 more dollars.
#unknown Thirty more.
#unknown Fo Forty dollars! Twentyeight ten.
#unknown Yes! Yes! Who's gonna be next? Your guy found him? Where is he? Okay, listen.
#unknown No, no, I don't care.
#unknown You have your guy pick Saul.
#unknown Just shut Saul.
#unknown Saul, shut up and give me the address.
#unknown I don't recommend it.
#unknown A.
#unknown P.
#unknown D.
#unknown 's been known to sit on this place .
#unknown .
#unknown keep an eye on the comings and goings.
#unknown Are they here now? Well, I don't see any sign, but that's the point.
#unknown Police could be the least of it.
#unknown You could just get mugged or shot.
#unknown How about you go on home, Walter? Let me handle this.
#unknown Yo.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Look at me, son.
#unknown Wake up.
#unknown Wake up.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown I ain't got nothing for you, man.
#unknown It's all gone.
#unknown Jesse, damn it, wake up.
#unknown Just Jesse, Jesse.
#unknown Jesse, it's me.
#unknown Okay, it's me.
#unknown It's Walt.
#unknown It's Walt.
#unknown Jesse.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Come on, let's get out of here.
#unknown No, no, no.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Help me out now.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown I'm good.
#unknown Right here, man.
#unknown Right here.
#unknown Listen, Jesse, you are not good right here.
#unknown You are not good at all.
#unknown You hear? Now, you just put your arms around me.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown You're gonna stand up and we're gonna walk out of here, okay? We're gonna take you someplace nice and safe.
#unknown That's it.
#unknown Now, let's go.
#unknown Come on.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown I killed her.
#unknown What? I killed her.
#unknown It was me.
#unknown I killed her, man.
#unknown I killed her.
#unknown No.
#unknown Jesse, look at me.
#unknown Look at me.
#unknown You didn't kill anybody.
#unknown I loved her.
#unknown I loved her more than anything.
#unknown No, no.
#unknown No.
#unknown I haven't given much thought to the programs.
#unknown I guess they should be.
#unknown I don't know.
#unknown Just use your best judgement.
#unknown There's no yellow dress here.
#unknown It's all It's all black and grey.
#unknown When's the last time you saw her ever wearing a yellow dress? What about blue? Blue's better than black, right? No, no.
#unknown Not dark blue.
#unknown More like.
#unknown Not superbright, either.
#unknown I mean, blue is blue.
#unknown No.
#unknown No cleavage.
#unknown Long sleeves.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It's nice.
#unknown It's nice.
#unknown Big yawn, Holly.
#unknown I know what you feel like.
#unknown I'm tired too.
#unknown Okay, sweetie.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Yes! Here we go.
#unknown Here we go.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Would you mind turning that thing down or off? Junior.
#unknown Hey.
#unknown The dinging.
#unknown Just turn down the volume.
#unknown Dad, it's money.
#unknown Just please do it.
#unknown Okay, the noise is disturbing the baby.
#unknown Marie, slow down.
#unknown I can't Oh, my God.
#unknown You are kidding me.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Of course.
#unknown Any day after school.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Wait.
#unknown I'm gonna Let me tell him, and I'll call you right back.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Guess what.
#unknown What? You are gonna be in the newspaper.
#unknown No way.
#unknown One of Marie's patients works at the Journal.
#unknown She told him about the website and the donations and they're gonna do a story about you.
#unknown For real? Yep.
#unknown They're coming to interview you with a photo and everything.
#unknown Awesome.
#unknown lt'll mean more hits.
#unknown And more contributions.
#unknown East of Scottsdale? Let me guess.
#unknown Not talking.
#unknown Nope.
#unknown Not a one.
#unknown Someone somewhere is running one tight ship.
#unknown All right, chief.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Thanks a lot.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown You too.
#unknown Agent Schrader, can you spare a moment? Yes, sir.

#unknown Hi, Gus.
#unknown You guys make some killer chicken.
#unknown Thank you very much.
#unknown These gentlemen are underwriting this year's Fun Run and I thought I would give them a tour.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Get to see what you're supporting.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Can you tell us a little about your work here? Yes, the Albuquerque office covers everything from drugrelated money laundering to interdiction of illicit substances crossing the border.
#unknown Now, the group that I supervise focuses on methamphetamine which is a growing problem in the country, unfortunately.
#unknown Terrible.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown It is indeed.
#unknown We've had some successes locally but overall, the supply seems to be growing.
#unknown I gotta tell you, community outreach, like this Fun Run one of the most powerful weapons we have.
#unknown Anything we can do.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Thank you, Hank.
#unknown Gentlemen.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Is this one of your agents? Oh, yeah, no, no, that's my brotherinlaw.
#unknown He's got a health issue.
#unknown We're trying to Oh, I'm very sorry.
#unknown What sort of health issue? Lung cancer.
#unknown Oh, that's a rough one.
#unknown Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
#unknown Please.
#unknown Please.
#unknown I'm happy to do it.
#unknown Thank you very much.
#unknown You're welcome.
#unknown Just so you know, I won't be back for a while.
#unknown I'm gonna have my surgery on Friday.
#unknown I'm hopeful it'll go well.
#unknown But if not, Saul will take care of things.
#unknown He's got your money.
#unknown He's keeping it for you.
#unknown Look, Jesse, lingering on things doesn't help, believe me.
#unknown Just try and focus on getting better, okay.
#unknown I deserve this.
#unknown What? What you said in the desert.
#unknown I get it, what you meant.
#unknown I deserve whatever happens.
#unknown Oh, shit.
#unknown There he is! Walt, they're doing a feature on Walter Jr.
#unknown We called you about 50 times.
#unknown Marie, I thought we were just talking about a newspaper story.
#unknown I know.
#unknown But I thought, you know, if it's good enough for the Journal then why not TV? So I went for it.
#unknown This is him? Yes.
#unknown This is Dad.
#unknown Great.
#unknown Let's get everyone on the couch.
#unknown I'm thinking Walt Jr.
#unknown in the middle Mom and Dad on either side.
#unknown Mom and Dad? How much money have you raised so far? Six thousand, three hundred and sixty dollars.
#unknown But there's more coming in all the time.
#unknown Wow, that's amazing.
#unknown We don't even know what to say.
#unknown It's just It's been incredible.
#unknown Judging from things you have written about him your dad must be quite a guy.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown He is.
#unknown He's the best.
#unknown You don't wanna lose him, do you, Walter? None of us do.
#unknown We love him.
#unknown He's a good man, isn't he? Absolutely.
#unknown Ask anyone.
#unknown Anybody.
#unknown He's a great father, a great teacher.
#unknown He knows everything there is to know about chemistry.
#unknown He's patient with you, and he's always there for you.
#unknown He's just decent.
#unknown And he always does the right thing.
#unknown And that's how he teaches me to be.
#unknown Would you say he's your hero? Oh, yeah.
#unknown Yes, ma'am.
#unknown Totally.
#unknown My dad is my hero.
#unknown Does that put him to sleep? This one just relaxes him a little.
#unknown We're almost ready.
#unknown We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Thank you.
#unknown Well.
#unknown Here we are.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Relaxed yet? As a matter of fact.
#unknown I don't know what this stuff is, but it's pretty great.
#unknown Yeah, it looks like it.
#unknown We'll be here when you wake up.
#unknown Well, I'll be looking for you.
#unknown They'll probably want me to take your glasses.
#unknown Yeah, you better.
#unknown Yeah, okay.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown I got them.
#unknown Where's your phone? Your cell phone.
#unknown Did you bring it? Which one? I'm pretty sure he didn't bring it, Mom.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Well, first things first.
#unknown How old is that baby now? When do I get to meet her? I was actually thinking of bringing her today, but.
#unknown She's 7 weeks tomorrow.
#unknown Seven, right? Yeah.
#unknown Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture here somewhere.
#unknown She's beautiful.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Always a relief to say that and actually mean it.
#unknown How's your pain level, Walter? It's.
#unknown Very low, basically.
#unknown Shortness of breath? A bit, but much better.
#unknown Good.
#unknown Well, your margins look good.
#unknown I can't foresee the future but even conservatively speaking I can say that you bought yourself some real time here.
#unknown There's no reason not to be optimistic.
#unknown That's great.
#unknown That is great.
#unknown Thank you, doctor.
#unknown So when could he get back to his normal routine? He can ease into it now.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown And can he go back to work or? I'd give it a few more weeks.
#unknown Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting and continue to get plenty of rest.
#unknown But he can be on his own? I mean, just more, you know, independent.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Use your best judgement.
#unknown Well.
#unknown Now, that's good news for you, huh, honey? One less baby in the house.
#unknown Don, hey.
#unknown Hey, Stew.
#unknown Hey, welcome back.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown It's good to be back.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown We were all so sorry to hear.
#unknown Yes.
#unknown Thanks.
#unknown Terrible thing.
#unknown Just.
#unknown But, you know, we've all been thinking about you, and.
#unknown You been doing okay? I'm doing okay.
#unknown After a certain point, time off doesn't help so I figured I'd rather be here.
#unknown Focus on work.
#unknown Sure.
#unknown Absolutely.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Well, see you inside.
#unknown Continue to descend through 1500.

#unknown Juliet5Bravo, roger.
#unknown Clear direct to Winslow.
#unknown I think I may just keep this.
#unknown Sky? What do you think? Doesn't look so bad, right? What are you doing? I'm going to Hank and Marie's for the weekend.
#unknown Since when? I'm taking the baby with me.
#unknown Marie will pick up Walter Jr.
#unknown from school.
#unknown You'll have the house to yourself for two days.
#unknown I want you to pack your things and leave.
#unknown Why would I do that? Hank has offered to help.
#unknown You shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown I want you gone by Monday morning.
#unknown I want I want you gone.
#unknown Okay.
#unknown Can you at least tell me why? Because you're a liar, Walt.
#unknown Two cell phones, after all.
#unknown What? Before your surgery, I asked if you had packed your cell phone and you said, "Which one?" When? Skyler, I was medicated.
#unknown I mean, I could have said the world was flat.
#unknown You know what I think? I think you accidentally told the truth.
#unknown Honey, we have been over this.
#unknown Asked and answered, right? Then it got me thinking again about all the strange behaviour.
#unknown Not the least of which was the disappearance.
#unknown Out of my mind with worry, calling hospitals checking the morgue.
#unknown Your fugue state? I had to believe that, didn't l? I had to find a way.
#unknown I mean, who would lie about such a thing? You tell me, Skyler.
#unknown You tell me exactly what it is you think I'm lying about.
#unknown What? I'm having an affair.
#unknown Is that what you think? Yeah.
#unknown For the last few weeks.
#unknown With whom? Who am I having an affair with? Well, my guess was Gretchen Schwartz.
#unknown Something was going on between you.
#unknown I just knew.
#unknown Jesus.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Get me a Bible to swear on, if that's what it takes.
#unknown I am not having an affair with Gretchen.
#unknown I know.
#unknown I know you're not.
#unknown Because I asked her.
#unknown It really took me forever to get in touch with her.
#unknown She was ducking my calls for weeks.
#unknown So I finally left a message: "What exactly is going on between you and my husband?" I thought that'd get her attention, and it did.
#unknown So she called me back, and she finally told me.
#unknown The money for your treatment Gretchen and Elliott didn't give you a dime.
#unknown They paid for nothing.
#unknown You refused every offer they made you.
#unknown But that didn't make sense because I checked with Delcavoli and the hospital and not including your surgery we're nearly paid up.
#unknown Over $100,000.
#unknown Out of where? Out of thin air? But then I called your mother.
#unknown Yeah.
#unknown Thanks for that too.
#unknown But I thought, you know, maybe she has some money that I don't know about.
#unknown Maybe she contributed.
#unknown It's possible.
#unknown It turns out that not only is the money not from your mother she didn't even know that you have cancer.
#unknown You never went to see her.
#unknown I dropped you at the airport.
#unknown I picked you up.
#unknown You were gone for four days and yet she swears that you were never there.
#unknown Lies on top of lies on top of lies.
#unknown Skyler.
#unknown Could you just once do me the courtesy of not denying it? Skyler.
#unknown Skyler, don't do this, please.
#unknown I.
#unknown Skyler, please don't go.
#unknown If I tell you the truth, will you stay? Stay, and I will tell you everything.
#unknown Whatever it is I'm afraid to know.
