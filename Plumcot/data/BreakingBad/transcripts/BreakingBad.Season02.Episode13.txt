walter_white  When?
walter_white  Skyler, I was medicated.
walter_white  I mean, I could have said the world was flat. You
skyler_white  You know what I think?
skyler_white  I think you accidentally told the truth.
walter_white  Honey, we have been over this.
walter_white  Asked and answered, right?
skyler_white  Then it got me thinking again about all the strange behaviour.
skyler_white  Not the least of which was the disappearance.
skyler_white  Out of my mind with worry, calling hospitals checking the morgue.
skyler_white  Your fugue state?
skyler_white  a thing?
walter_white  You tell me, Skyler.
walter_white  You tell me exactly what it is you think I'm lying about.
walter_white  What
walter_white  What? I'm having an affair.

skyler_white  Yeah. For
skyler_white  For the last few weeks.
walter_white  With whom?
walter_white  Who am I having an affair with?
skyler_white  Well, my guess was Gretchen Schwartz.
skyler_white  Something was going on between you.
skyler_white  I just knew.
walter_white  Jesus. Skyler
walter_white  Skyler.
walter_white  Get me a Bible to swear on, if that's what it takes.
walter_white  I am not having an affair with Gretchen.
skyler_white  I know.
skyler_white  I know you're not.
skyler_white  Because I asked her.
skyler_white  It really took me forever to get in touch with her.
skyler_white  She was ducking my calls for weeks.
skyler_white  So I finally left a message :
