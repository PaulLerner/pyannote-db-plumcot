Walt and Skyler have a baby girl. Now that Jesse is hooked on heroin, Walt refuses to give him his money until he gets clean. Meanwhile, as an excuse for his money, Walt decides to donate the money to himself through his son's new website.
Just as Skyler goes into labor, Walt has to deliver his 38 lbs. of meth to the wholesaler who has agreed to buy the lot for $1.2 million. Jesse and his girlfriend are now both doing heroin and when Walt races to Jesse's house to collect their stuff, he's stoned out of his mind. When Jesse wakes up the next morning, he has no recollection that Walt had been there the night before to get their stuff and freaks out thinking he's been robbed. Walt lets him stew for the day. Jane's father learns that she and Jesse are back on drugs and insists that she return to rehab or he will call the police. She agrees but Jesse has told her about his windfall and she knows exactly what to do. Walt's biggest problem is that he has all of this money but can't spend it because everyone thinks he's on the verge of bankruptcy. Walter Jr may have provided him with the solution.
