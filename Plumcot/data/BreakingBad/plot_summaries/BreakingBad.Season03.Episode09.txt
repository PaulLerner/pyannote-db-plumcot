Skyler hatches a plan as Hank's hospital bills stack up. Meanwhile, Walt and Gus come to a better understanding as Jesse, looking for more independence, pursues a new opportunity.
Walt and Jesse are now in full production in the new lab and are easily producing the 200 lbs per week of meth, as agreed. In fact, they're producing a few pounds more than required and Jesse can't quite understand why they're just "giving it away". He decides to take advantage of the situation. Walt's brother-in-law Hank is still recovering in the hospital and Marie is at a loss about what to do when she learns that their health plan will not necessarily provide the quantity and the quality of physical therapy required for Hank to fully recover the use of his legs. Skyler proposes that she and Walt pay the bills and has an interesting story to tell about how they can afford it. As for Walt, he realizes that his life was in danger and that it was only Gus' intervention that saved him. Walt seeks assurance from Gus that his family's lives would be safe and options for extending the contract beyond 3 months are discussed.
