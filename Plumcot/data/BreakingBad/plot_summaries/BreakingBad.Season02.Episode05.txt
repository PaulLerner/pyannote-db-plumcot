Walt and Jesse decide to start their own little empire with the help of Jesse's friends: Skinny Pete, Combo, and Badger. Meanwhile, Hank tries to pull himself together after his encounter with Tuco.
Walt continues his treatment and is starting to feel better but is concerned at the growing medical bills. Jesse begins to re-establish himself paying off his debts and getting a new place to live. He's interested in the renter however, Jane Margolis, who lives next door. Walt and Jesse soon rev up the RV and are cooking again. Jesse's not keen on selling the stuff on the street and suggests he and Walt take over Tuco's role as a distributor. Hank and the DEA have come across the name Heisenberg and aren't sure if he's real or just an urban legend. Hank is promoted and soon appointed to a tri-State drug task force. He may have health issues of his own however.
Tensions and bills mount at the White household. Hank makes progress at work, but struggles with some residual effects from his encounter with Tuco. Jesse takes charge and assembles a crew of dealers to get their product out on the streets.
