Walt and Jesse are held captive for Gus, after Gale's death. Meanwhile, Skyler tries to find out what happened to Walt.
Jesse takes out the competition, causing a crisis in Gus's multi-million-dollar basement lab. Mike holds Walter and Jesse hostage and Victor shows off his cooking skills as they wait for Gus to arrive, change clothes, and render judgment. Meanwhile, Hank's recovery is slow and humiliating; and, Skyler tries to keep Walter Jr. from getting his hopes up. Remorse is in short supply.
With Gale Boetticher dead, Mike keeps Walt and Jesse under wraps in the lab pending Gus' arrival. Gus has little to say when he arrives. Walt pleads his case and Gus calmly shows him to what extent he means business. Walt is convinced that they're dead men and tells Jesse so. Skyler wants to pursue the purchase of the car wash where Walt once worked but he has little time to focus on the deal. Hank Schrader meanwhile is now rehabilitating at home but is is surly and unhelpful.
