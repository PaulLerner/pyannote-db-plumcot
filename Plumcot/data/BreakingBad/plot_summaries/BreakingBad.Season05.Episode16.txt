Walter White makes one last attempt to secure his family's future, while also visiting some old enemies, during his final return to Albuquerque.
In the series finale, Walt returns to Albuquerque to settle accounts. He visits his former business partners Elliott and Gretchen Schwartz with a proposition. When they are less than forthcoming, he makes them an offer they can't refuse. He pays one last visit to Skyler but avoids seeing Walt Jr. In a coffee shop, he meets Todd and Lydia saying he's now broke but has a new formula for making meth that he wants to sell them. It's all a ruse to get a meeting with the neo-Nazis who stole his money. Once there, he puts his final plan into action.
