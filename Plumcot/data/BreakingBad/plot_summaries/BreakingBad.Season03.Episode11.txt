Skyler gets more involved in Walt's business, much to his chagrin, as Hank struggles with his recovery. Meanwhile, Jesse takes an active role in his new enterprise, leading him to a startling discovery.
Skyler gets the first of Hank's hospital bills and decides the time has come to get more involved in Walt's business affairs. She's particularly concerned that the money is laundered correctly and that it absolutely cannot be traced back to Walt's illegal activities. Walt introduces her to Saul the lawyer but she thinks the investment he's lined up is ludicrous and has a better idea. Jesse meanwhile is still trying to peddle the meth he been skimming at the lab and fed up with the slow pace, decides to show how it's done. At the hospital, Marie is thrilled at the prospect of Hank returning home but he doesn't seem anywhere near as pleased. Walt's employer, Gus, invites him to dinner and dispenses sage advice.
