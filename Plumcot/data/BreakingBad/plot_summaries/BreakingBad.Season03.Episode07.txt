Jesse ends up in the hospital after getting beaten up by Hank. Now he is threatening to press charges against the DEA. To stop him, Walt decides to bring Jesse on as his partner, once again.
Hank, outraged over having been tricked into thinking that his wife has been in a horrible accident, goes after Jesse and gives him a severe beating. Jesse has every intention of pressing charges and Hank is suspended. He has other problems however when Gus points the Mexican cousins in his direction. Skyler meanwhile visits Walt in an attempt to help Hank. She wants him to get Jesse to drop the charges but he's not inclined to help out. At work, however, Walt's new assistant messes up their first batch of meth requiring them to start over again. His solution is to get Gus to hire Jesse as his assistant but he says he's not interested.
