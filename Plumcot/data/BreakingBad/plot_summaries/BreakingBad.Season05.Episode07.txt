Mike and Jesse are out. Now Walt has to handle things on his own. Hank finally finds a rat in Mike's gang.
In the desert, Walter meets with the Phoenix crystal meth distributors to set up a new partnership. Mike's out, Jesse wants out, Skyler's checked out, and Hank's boss wants him to stop spending time and resources on pursuing Mike. Walt needs to get the bug out of Hank's office, and Hank may have one more play.
Walt is in full control and in a desert meeting, convinces the Phoenix drug dealers to buy his product rather than the raw chemicals. As he had already announced, Mike has decided to retire and gets rids of his weapons stash. He has a lawyer paying off the 9 men in jail and he's got quite a stash accumulated for his granddaughter. At the DEA, Hank gets a dressing down from his boss over spending too much time and effort - and money - tracking Mike and is ordered to lay off. He decides to focus on the attorney for Mike's 9 associates - who is also Mike's bag man. Walt volunteers to get Mike's bag of cash he will use on the run and delivers it to him personally.
