While Walt tries to subvert Hank's probe into the Albuquerque meth scene, a deadly warning forces Gus to consider a deal with the cartel.
Hank is like a dog with a bone and keeps digging into Gus Fring's business dealings despite Walt's attempts to get him to stop. When Hank learns that Gus has a warehouse operation, Mike and a crew have to get rid of any trace of drugs on the premises. The Cartel however is lying in wait. When Jesse expresses concern over his future well-being Gus asks him over for dinner and asks him one question: can he cook Walt's recipe without Walt's assistance. Skyler meanwhile gets a visit from her old boss who reveals that he's about to undergo an IRS audit. She has to be quick on her her feet if she's to avoid being audited herself.
Skyler helps an acquaintance with his IRS problems. Hank gets a line on the money laundering case. The cartel isn't taking 'no' for an answer, and continues to apply murderous pressure on Gus's operations. Gus asks Jesse the ultimate question: can you cook without Walter? Walter continues to push Jesse to poison Gus: push comes to shove and then more.
