Skinny Pete has been ripped off by a drug addicted couple and Walt has made it plain to Jesse that unless he does something about it, word will get around pretty quick that they are an easy mark. Jesse isn't a very effective informer however and is quickly in over his head. Walt goes back to work but not all is going smoothly. Walt's story starts to unravel when Skyler gets a call from Gretchen Schwartz and she thanks her for paying for Walt's treatment. Gretchen doesn't give him away but his bitterness at their past relationship - personal and business - comes out.
