Walt struggles as he adapts to aspects of his new identity. Jesse plans an escape against Jack and his crew.
Walt is hiding out with Saul's man waiting to get his new identity and leave Albuquerque. He's joined by none other than Saul himself who is also on the run from the authorities due to his connection with Heisenberg. Walt is angry, particularly at Todd's uncle for taking most of his money. He wants Saul to help him get it back but Saul's advice is to turn himself in before the police turn on his family. When Walt is finally relocated, he finds himself living in a cabin on a snowy piece of land in New Hampshire. Saul's man comes once a month with food and the like but Walt is basically a self-exiled prisoner unable to venture off his property for fear of being recognized. He seems ready to pack it in but comes full circle after seeing his former business partners on TV.
