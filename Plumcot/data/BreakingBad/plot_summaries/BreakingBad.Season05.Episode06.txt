In the aftermath of the train heist, Jesse and Mike decide to quit the business, leaving Walt to handle things on his own. Mike is being followed by the DEA.
With blood on their hands, the Walter, Jesse, and Mike partnership must first decide what to do about Todd. After that's settled, Walter is ready to cook again, but Jesse and Mike have another idea. Skyler spends some time with her daughter and with Marie, and Walter's invitation that Jesse stay for dinner adds to Skyler's misery. Hank and his team put nearly round-the-clock surveillance on Mike, and a meth producer in Phoenix has a plan.
Having successfully stolen enough chemicals to keep them in business for a year and a half, Walt has to face a number of challenges if he's to start cooking again. Jesse is badly shaken by the shooting of the 14 year-old boy who happened to come across them in the desert and who Todd shot. They decide to keep Todd as part of the team, over Jesse's objections but Mike lays down the law. Skyler learns from her sister that Walt told her about the affair. Mike soon realizes that the DEA is following him and decides he wants out. For that matter, so does Jesse. Walt plans to continue processing meth on his own but his plans to dissolve the partnership run into a serious problem.
