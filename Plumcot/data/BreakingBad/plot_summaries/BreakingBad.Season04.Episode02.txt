Walt attempts to form a new alliance as he plans his next move. Meanwhile Skyler pushes Walt towards a business opportunity, in hopes of protecting the family.
Shaken by Gus's calm violence, Jesse cokes up; bleary-eyed and jittery, he throws a party. Walter, believing it's kill or be killed, buys a snub-nosed .38 on the black market, intent on shooting Gus and Mike. Skyler looks to launder money at a car wash, and, to Hank's increasing irritation, Marie insists on cheering his every step. Men deliver boxes of minerals and pick up boxes of crystal.
Convinced that Gus will eventually kill him, Walt begins to prepare for the inevitable by purchasing a small revolver that he can easily conceal. He's clearly thinking about striking first but Mike makes it clear that he will never see Gus again. His suggestion that they work together on eliminating the threat gets him a beating and a nasty black eye. Jesse has got himself a new sound system and decides that the best way to spend his time at home is to constantly party. Tired of husband Hank's surliness, Marie Schrader takes to visiting open houses. Skyler's attempt to buy the car wash from Walt's old boss does not go well.
