Jesse rides shotgun with Mike on a perilous run of pickups, prompting Walt to worry that his partner is about to be killed.
In his attempt to save Jesse, Walt visits Gus' fast food restaurant but isn't quite prepared for what he learns. Nor is Jesse for that matter. In fact, he proves to be quite useful though not everything is as it seems. Hank is convinced that Gale Boetticher was Heisenberg and tells the local police detective that he really has no further interest in the case. He mentions that Jesse Pinkman could have been involved but is not likely the shooter. Walt and Skyler close the deal on the car wash and take a major step in repairing their relationship but at dinner with Hank and Marie, a slightly drunken Walt says that from what he saw in Gale's notebook, it's obvious he isn't Heisenberg. Hank re-examines the files and finds something quite puzzling.
