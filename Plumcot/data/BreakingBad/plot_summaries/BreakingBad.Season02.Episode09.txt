Walt and Jesse become stranded out in the middle of the desert after cooking more crystal.
Walt is convinced that his medical condition is deteriorating. He continues to have coughing fits and is now coughing up blood. After his attorney and new business partner crunches the numbers, he realizes that there isn't much money left for his family. He and Jesse set off for the desert for a marathon cooking session over an extended weekend. Jesse just continues to put his foot in it, this time by leaving the keys in the ignition and inadvertently draining the battery. They find themselves in the middle of the desert, cold and without much water. Walt's knowledge of chemistry again saves the day.
