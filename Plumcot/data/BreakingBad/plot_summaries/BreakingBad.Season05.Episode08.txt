Walt expands his business overseas, and the money is pouring in.
Hank's team puts pressure on Mike's crew, and at least one is ready to flip. Walter meets with Lydia, demanding the names of Mike's crew; she's afraid that once she lists them, Walter will dispatch her. She offers him a deal. Walter talks to Todd's uncle, Hank has a terrible day at work, and the cooking continues. Marie pushes Skyler to let the children return home, she takes Walt on a short car trip, and Hank may have a touch of constipation.
With Mike now gone, Walt has a number of loose ends to deal with. He asks Lydia for the names of Mike's men in prison and she reluctantly gives them to him but only after they agree on a business deal. With those names, Walt sets out to deal with all of them. He's soon back in business and producing immense profits for himself. So much so that Skyler asks him how much more they would ever need. Walt agrees and decides to call it quits. Brother-in-law Hank come across a damning piece of information however.
