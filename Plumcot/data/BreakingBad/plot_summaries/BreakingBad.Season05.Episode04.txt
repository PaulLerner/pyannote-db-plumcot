It's Walt's 51st birthday. His return to the drug business causes Skyler to go into depression.
Walter, his confidence up, leases two muscle cars - one for himself and one for Junior. He's turning 51 and would like a party, Hank and his team visit Lydia in Houston, Jesse flies there to pick up the accelerant, Mike makes a decision that Jessie wants reversed, Hank is offered a promotion, Walter explains Skyler's behavior to Marie and Hank with references to Ted, and Skyler, coming slowly out of her funk, hatches a makeshift plan to protect her children.
Lydia nearly blows a gasket when Hank Schrader and other DEA agents show up at Madrigal's US offices. They look through the warehouse and arrest one of the workers. Mike tells her to calm down but she's clearly not happy. When Jesse stops by to pick up chemicals, he and Lydia see a GPS device attached to the bottom of the barrel. Mike knows who put it there and decides to take action. At home, Walt celebrates his 51st birthday. He leases a couple of fancy cars and they invite Hank and Marie over for dinner. Skyler is still having a nervous breakdown and makes it clear to Walt that she does not want the children in the house.
