Skyler keeps mysteriously leaving without talking to Walt. Jesse's parents throw him out of his own house.
Walt and Jesse appear to be in the clear but Jesse has no money and Walt can't leave the room without Skyler wondering where he is. Jesse's parents are still fed up with him and his drug use so they order him out of the house - it turns out they own it, not Jesse. He finds himself not only without a place to stay but with few friends who will put him up for the night. He ends up tracking down his RV and spends the night. Walt's overly correct behavior sets Skyler of on a binge of not telling him anything about what she's up to or who she's seeing. She's fed up with Walt's behavior and wants to know what is really going on.
