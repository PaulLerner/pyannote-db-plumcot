Walt makes his next move against Hank, putting Hank in a tough position. Hank confronts Jesse and attempts to turn him against Walt, and Jesse decides it's time to move on. Meanwhile, Todd has taken over the business.
Walt is still trying to convince Hank - and to a lesser extent Marie - that they should do nothing and just let nature take its course. He's no longer involved in any criminal activity and will be dead in a few months from his cancer. They're not very receptive to his ideas but when they get home they find that Walt has recorded a video confession admitting to everything - and naming Hank as the mastermind behind it all. Jesse meanwhile has been released from jail. He said nothing to the police or Hank about his business with Walt but seems completely lost. In a difficult meeting with Walt, he agrees to acquire a new identity and start a life in Alaska. As he awaits Saul's contact who will provide him with what he needs, he comes to the realization that it was Walt who tried to kill Brock.
