Walt's disappearance is met with investigation by both his wife and Hank, as Tuco Salamanca intends to leave town with his kidnapped cooks.
Having been kidnapped by a crazed Tuco, Walt and Jesse are held prisoner by him in a desert shack where he often hides out and takes care of his sick uncle. Walt's brother-in-law Hank and the DEA have rolled Tuco's entire organization and he thinks that his two prisoners may have been a source of information. Walt tries to feed Tuco the poison he prepared. Walter Jr. meanwhile takes a bit of time off to look for Walt. Skyler is sick with worry and has been distributing handbills with Walt's photo. He remembers that Jesse Pinkman was Walt's source of marijuana and tries to track him down. Tuco finally realizes that his prisoners are up to something and is obviously going to kill Jesse. After a fight in which Tuco is shot, Hank shows up looking for Jesse.
