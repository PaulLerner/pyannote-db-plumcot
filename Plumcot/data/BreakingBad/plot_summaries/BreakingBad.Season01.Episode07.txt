Walt and Jesse try to up their game by making more of the crystal every week for Tuco. Unfortunately, some of the ingredients they need are not easy to find. Meanwhile, Skyler realizes that her sister is a shoplifter.
Having made a deal with Tuco to provide him with two pounds of crystal meth the following week, Walt learns from Jesse that they may have problems getting a key ingredient. Enjoying his new Heisenberg persona, Walt delivers only half a pound to Tuco but demands the entire amount of cash with the promise that he'll deliver four pounds the following week. Jesse reels, but Walt has a plan. They will have to break into a pharmaceutical supply warehouse however. Skyler's sister Marie throws a baby shower for her and her gift is a baby's tiara. Deciding that it's too extravagant, Skyler tries to return it to the store with surprising results.
