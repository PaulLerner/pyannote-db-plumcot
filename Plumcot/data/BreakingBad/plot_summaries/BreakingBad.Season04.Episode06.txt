Skyler adopts an aloof approach when she suspects that Walt isn't telling her the truth. Meanwhile, Jesse proves his worth to Mike and Gus.
It's the morning after the night before and Walt has a major hangover. Skyler is now convinced that Walt is in danger but he makes sure she understands exactly how important he is to the criminal organization. He's a little too blunt as Skyler's reaction is to take the baby and disappear for a few days. One of Gus' trucks has been hijacked so Mike and Jesse are tasked to get the blue meth back. Once again, Jesse proves to be unexpectedly useful. In the lab, Walt is fed up with Jesse going off on errands with Mike and so comes up with his own solution to cleaning up. He also learns that his actions may have unintended consequences.
