Badger is caught by the DEA. Walt and Jesse hire the best criminal lawyer in town, Saul Goodman.
Walt and Jesse have yet another problem to deal with when one of their dealers, Jesse's friend Badger, is arrested by the Albuquerque police. They end up hiring a shady lawyer, Saul Goodman, who has a unique way of ensuring that Badger gets off with a light sentence without having to give away Jesse or Walt's identity. As Walt learns however, it may come at a very high price. Walt's brother-in-law Hank, the DEA Agent, is suffering from post-traumatic stress following the shooting in Juarez. He puts on a brave face but is having trouble just getting out of bed in the morning. Walt has some suggestions for him.
