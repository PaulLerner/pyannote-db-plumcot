In celebration of his birthday, Michael makes a mandatory invite of the staff during the workday to go ice skating.
It is Michael's birthday and he begins making special demands of everybody in the office, and he is met with a chilly reception. Unbeknown to him, Kevin is waiting to hear the results of a test to determine whether or not he has skin cancer. In an effort to help, Jim and Pam sneak out of the office to buy Kevin an assortment of goodies to try and make him feel better.
