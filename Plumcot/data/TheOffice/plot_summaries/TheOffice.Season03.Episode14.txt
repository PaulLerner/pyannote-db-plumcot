Michael asks Jim to get a male stripper for Phyllis's office bachelorette party, but he gets a Ben Franklin impersonator instead. Meanwhile, the men's bachelor party goes as planned until Michael becomes uncomfortable with the stripper.
Since Phyllis is holding a bachelorette party in the office, Michael decides to hold a bachelor party in the warehouse downstairs. He assigns Jim to find a stripper for the women while he and Ryan are out finding dirty tricks for the bachelor party. Instead, Jim hires a Ben Franklin scholar for the women to enjoy. The bachelor party doesn't go as planned because none of the men want to participate with the stripper except Michael, who quickly feels uncomfortable because he has a girlfriend. Meanwhile, upstairs, Pam and Karen share a small conversation, during which Karen questions Pam about her feelings for Jim. With the ending of the bachelorette party, Ben Franklin hits on Pam and has an intense game of Ben Franklin trivia with Dwight.
