Very much unlike his staff, an overeager Michael can't wait for this year's annual Dundies awards.
The time comes for the annual Dundies Awards to award everyone in the office with their fine work with odd categories. Created my Michael, he is overly excited for it while everyone else couldn't care less. Michael sends Pam to look at highlights from the past Dundies while preparing to have this years Dundies as Chili's.
