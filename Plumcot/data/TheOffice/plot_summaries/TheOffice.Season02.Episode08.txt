Instead of talking to his employees about their work, Michael uses their annual review time to gather feedback on his "relationship" with Jan.
It's performance review time at Dunder Mifflin and it is up to Michael Scott to evaluate his employees to determine if any pay increases or bonuses are necessary. Jan from corporate is also coming into review him and, since it will be his first time seeing her face-to-face since their encounter in the Chilli's parking lot, Michael begins asking his employees for their advice regarding his relationship with Jan. Meanwhile, a suggestion box is opened at the Scranton branch so that employees can express their suggestions in improving the branch, with disastrous results.
