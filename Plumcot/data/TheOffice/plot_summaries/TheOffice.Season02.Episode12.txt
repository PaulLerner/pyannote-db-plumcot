Michael's "injury" from a George Foreman Grill distracts the staff from Dwight, the one with the real injury.
Michael, being Michael Scott, overreacts to an 'injury' he has. This steers everyone away from realising that Dwight is the one with a more serious injury. No matter how ill or injured you are though, if you call shotgun, you get the front seat, no matter what...at least according to Michael.
One morning, Michael clamps his foot onto a George Foreman Grille, thus "injuring" his foot. Dwight volunteers to rescue Michael from his condo, slamming his car into a fence on the way out of the parking lot. When Dwight and Michael arrive back at the office, Michael begins making such a fuss about his burned foot that no one notices that Dwight is the one with the real injury.
