Dwight takes former temp Ryan to his beet farm to initiate Ryan to his new job at Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight takes new full-timer Ryan (B.J. Novak, who also wrote the episode) out on his first sales call, but he puts the novice through a series of demanding tests and challenges, not to mention an unnecessary excursion to the Schrute family beet farm. Meanwhile, Michael is ordered by corporate to log his work activity; and Jim tries to adapt to life at the Stamford branch.
Dwight decides he wants to get his relationship with Ryan off on the right foot, having gotten along so badly with Jim. But he can't resist the temptation to initiate Ryan into his twisted world as an adventure ensues at the Schrute beet farm. Meanwhile, Jan decides to do something about Michael's lack of motivation, but chooses the worst possible day to have Pam monitor his productivity as Free Pretzel Day at the office park brings efficiency to a standstill, and gets Stanley more excited than anything else ever has.
