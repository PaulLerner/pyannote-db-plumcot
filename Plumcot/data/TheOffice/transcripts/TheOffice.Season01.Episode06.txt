jan_levinson At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
michael_scott Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
jan_levinson Uh, yes. Yes you can.
michael_scott Um, question Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...
jan_levinson No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
michael_scott I didn't mean me!
michael_scott Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
dwight_schrute s*x.
michael_scott It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.
dwight_schrute Torture.
michael_scott Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid.
pam_beesly Uh, Michael?

pam_beesly There's a person here...
michael_scott And fries!
pam_beesly There's...
michael_scott And shake! What? Go ahead.
pam_beesly There's a person here who wants to sell handbags.

pam_beesly Okay, I told her you'd talk to her.
michael_scott Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
katy This one is hand embroidered.
michael_scott All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
dwight_schrute Cocks in the henhouse.
michael_scott Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
katy Katy.
michael_scott Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
michael_scott Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm against violence in the workplace.
dwight_schrute So am I.
michael_scott Nobody cares what you think.
dwight_schrute Doesn't matter.
michael_scott So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day.
katy Wow, thanks.
pam_beesly There's an HR meeting in there at 11 30.
michael_scott Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
michael_scott I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
michael_scott This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.
michael_scott So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
katy I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
michael_scott Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
katy What?
michael_scott It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
katy Regular coffee is fine.
michael_scott Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb
katy No really it is.
michael_scott No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
katy Bring it on.
michael_scott Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
kevin_malone So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
pam_beesly No.
kevin_malone She's prettier than you though.
pam_beesly That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
kevin_malone
katy So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
dwight_schrute The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
michael_scott There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
katy Thank you.
michael_scott I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
katy Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um...
michael_scott Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
ryan_howard I'm installing File Share on all the computers.
michael_scott Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?

oscar_martinez I'm on the phone.
michael_scott Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
katy That was on Sesame Street.
michael_scott I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
katy No, I don't believe that.

jim_halpert Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.
kevin_malone What is your type?
jim_halpert Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.
roy_anderson That's disgusting.

roy_anderson Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.
pam_beesly We're not dating, we're engaged.
roy_anderson Engaged, yeah.
jim_halpert Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
jim_halpert She'd be perfect for you.
dwight_schrute Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
jim_halpert So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
dwight_schrute Assistant to the Regional Manager.
jim_halpert Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
dwight_schrute That's true.
jim_halpert Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
dwight_schrute True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
jim_halpert It's all gold.
katy Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
jim_halpert Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
dwight_schrute What's that?
jim_halpert You buy a purse.
dwight_schrute I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
jim_halpert Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.
dwight_schrute Like those?
jim_halpert Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
dwight_schrute Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
jim_halpert No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
jim_halpert Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
pam_beesly
jim_halpert Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
pam_beesly Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
jim_halpert Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
pam_beesly Oh!
jim_halpert Oh! That was really. This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.
pam_beesly Oh...
jim_halpert I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?
pam_beesly Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.
jim_halpert Here he comes, shhh...
jim_halpert Good.
pam_beesly
jim_halpert He did pick a good one.
pam_beesly You're horrible.
katy This one's really good for a hot date.
pam_beesly Yeah, what's that?
katy
pam_beesly I'm engaged. So...
katy Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.
pam_beesly I wished, right?
michael_scott Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?
katy Good.
michael_scott Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
katy Sorry.
michael_scott Busted.
katy Come back...
michael_scott Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
katy Is that from Starbucks?
michael_scott Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
katy Wow. Is that for the office?
michael_scott Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
katy I wouldn't think of it.
michael_scott Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!
michael_scott Oh the rotating um, steam wand. What? What's the matter?
katy Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me.
michael_scott Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?
katy Oh no, it's um...
michael_scott Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
katy No...
michael_scott Seriously. No, really.
katy No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
michael_scott God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.
katy At five?
michael_scott I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.
katy Okay.
michael_scott What?
katy Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
michael_scott Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
katy Okay. Cool.
michael_scott Excellent.
katy Cool.
michael_scott Great. Cool. Cool. Yeah, okay.
michael_scott I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
dwight_schrute It's actually better this way.
michael_scott No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
dwight_schrute Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
michael_scott No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
michael_scott But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
dwight_schrute Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
michael_scott Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
dwight_schrute Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
michael_scott No. I cannot promise you that.
dwight_schrute You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
michael_scott Listen, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Do you love her?
michael_scott Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel.
katy I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
stanley_hudson Hmmm...
michael_scott Espresso?
katy Oh, thank you.
michael_scott You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
stanley_hudson Is that from the machine that was in your office?
michael_scott Ummm-hmmm...
stanley_hudson I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
michael_scott Very easy to clean.
michael_scott Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right?
michael_scott Did we get any mail?
pam_beesly Yeah, I gave it to you.
michael_scott Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
pam_beesly So, can I..?
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
jim_halpert A futon?
pam_beesly
jim_halpert He's a grown man
pam_beesly That's what he said.
jim_halpert That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one.
roy_anderson What's up?
pam_beesly Hi.
roy_anderson Are you still mad at me?
pam_beesly Roy...
roy_anderson Come on
pam_beesly Cut it out.
roy_anderson Come on, you mad at me?
pam_beesly Stop it.
roy_anderson Are you still mad at me now?
pam_beesly Cut it out.
roy_anderson Are you mad at me now?
pam_beesly Stop.
roy_anderson Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.
pam_beesly Stop, I can't breathe.
roy_anderson I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't...
pam_beesly Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.
katy You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
angela_martin I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.
katy Oh no, it's fine that you, um. Here, what about the raspberry one? It's really uh, kind of festive. It's got a lot of personality.
angela_martin Yeah, uh no.
dwight_schrute Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
katy I don't think so I'm really busy.
dwight_schrute It will just take a second.
katy I can't.
dwight_schrute Just for a minute.
katy I really can't.
dwight_schrute Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
katy No.
dwight_schrute Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
katy Both.
katy What colors do you like?
angela_martin Gray. Dark Gray. Charcoal.
michael_scott Ryan.
ryan_howard Yeah.
michael_scott Would you like to help me with a special project?
ryan_howard I would love to.
michael_scott Alright.
michael_scott Okay, just throw out all the empties.
ryan_howard You don't want to recycle them?
michael_scott Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
ryan_howard Do you want this?
michael_scott No.
ryan_howard What about this bottle of power drink?
michael_scott Uh, what flavor?
ryan_howard Blue.
michael_scott Blue's not a flavor.
ryan_howard It says flavor Blue Blast.
michael_scott Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
jim_halpert Hi.
katy Hi.
jim_halpert I'm Jim, by the way.
katy I'm Katy.
jim_halpert Hi Katy, nice to meet you.
katy You sit out there, don't you?
jim_halpert I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
katy Okay, um...
jim_halpert Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
katy Okay.
jim_halpert Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can...
katy Okay.
michael_scott What, stop! Whoa! That's my Drakkar Noir.
ryan_howard No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.
michael_scott No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
ryan_howard Well, it's empty.
michael_scott Not it's not, there's some in the straw. There, now you may throw it out.
ryan_howard Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
michael_scott That's over several months, Ryan.
ryan_howard Still.
jim_halpert What's up?
pam_beesly I'm bored.
jim_halpert Thank you for choosing me.
pam_beesly No, I'm kidding. Um, so you got big plans this weekend?
jim_halpert Ah, well I think I'm gonna see Katy.
pam_beesly Really?
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly What are you guys going to do?
jim_halpert Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
pam_beesly That's great.
jim_halpert And stuff... yeah.
pam_beesly That's cool.
jim_halpert What are you doing?
pam_beesly I, I was gonna say, I think that um, we're gonna help Roy's cousin move.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly 'Cause Roy's got a truck.
jim_halpert That's cool.
pam_beesly Uh, huh. Yes.
jim_halpert That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
pam_beesly Great.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Okay, I'm gonna head back.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know.
michael_scott Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.
katy Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
michael_scott See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
jim_halpert Goodnight, Michael.
michael_scott Where you going?
jim_halpert I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
michael_scott With us?
katy I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause Jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
michael_scott Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
jim_halpert I got this.
michael_scott Alright, have fun.
katy Thanks.
jim_halpert I got it.
michael_scott Don't drink and drive.
michael_scott Take it easy.
jim_halpert Have a good night.
michael_scott You too, have a good night.
katy You got that?
jim_halpert Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
katy Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
jim_halpert Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
katy Why?
jim_halpert This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
katy It's a... it's a very nice car.
jim_halpert You're not going to freak out?
michael_scott Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
