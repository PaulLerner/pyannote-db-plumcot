ryan Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will not say "ryan Howard is a temp. " It will say "ryan Howard is a junior sales associate at a mid-range paper supply firm. . that'll show 'em.
jim You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
pam Me too. . I think we're just drunk.
jim No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk?
pam No. Jim---
jim Are you really gonna marry him? . Ok.
dwight jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! False. I do not miss him.
michael No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody "faggie". Why would anybody find that offensive?
toby OK I think oscar would just like if you used "lame" or something like that.
michael That's what faggie means!
toby No not really.
toby Apparently you called oscar "faggie" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
michael It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
toby All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay.
michael Exactly!
toby I mean for real.
michael Yeah, I know.
toby No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
michael OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
toby OK, I am telling you, oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
michael I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't. You don't call retarded people "retards". It's bad taste. You call your friends "retards" when they're acting retarded. And I consider oscar a friend.
michael Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea.
oscar No, it's fine.
michael No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just. I, I can't even imagine. the. thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me. how. you do that to another dude.
oscar That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
angela It explains so much.
oscar No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay. if. Uh. yeah I'm gay.
jim I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
jim Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view. right?
andy Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right?
jim Uh-huh, yeah. I am.
andy She's pretty hot huh? She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters.
jim OooOK.
andy OooOK.
jim I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, andy started calling me Big Tuna. . I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
andy Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, "Here Comes Treble. "
josh So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.
jim Oh, I can do that.
karen Jim's nice enough. I dont. I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this. What is that?
michael Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
dwight Of course.
michael What about Oscar?
dwight Absolutely not.
michael Well, he is.
dwight Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so.
michael There could be others. I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.
dwight You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
michael Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
michael Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.
dwight I really don't think so.
michael I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
dwight 
michael Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
dwight jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
michael That's ridiculous.
dwight Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.
michael Let's call him and get the website.
dwight Definitely.
jim What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem. It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer.
michael Well, they're sold out.
dwight Damn. I'll try Brookstone.
jim I miss that.
roy Chicken or fish?
pam Chicken.
roy So you havin' a good day?
pam Excellent, thanks.
roy Good, glad. OK.
pam Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
roy After pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back. . push;
stanley I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters.
kelly That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you.
oscar Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
angela Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace. and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented.
andy OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
jan You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
michael I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so.
jan That's not what it's called.
toby OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted oscar today?
michael What? What does that even.
jan Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
michael Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay. shame festival.
toby All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
michael I think angela might be gay. Could oscar and angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?
jan NO!
michael I don't kn--
jan No, it's not possible.
michael Anything's possible.
jan You know, imagine. you were gay.
michael Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
jan Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand?
michael The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100, 000 years of being weirded out by gays.
oscar Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
michael Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so. how would I know. Is that the right answer?
pam Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
dwight Uh, michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.
michael Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually. it is quite beautiful.
dwight Ah damn pop-ups.
oscar What are you doing?!
angela Watching some of your friends.
michael All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!
michael Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love. to other men.
michael We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or. accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you.
oscar Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now?
creed
 I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
michael Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
angela Judges and juries!
michael Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U. S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?
kevin
 That sounds great.
dwight I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
oscar No one else in this office is gay.
dwight What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
phyllis I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
michael That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing! See? Everybody has a chance!
michael But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!
phyllis No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
michael Right! And I take that as a compliment.
phyllis Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
michael Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
oscar You sound pretty defensive Michael.
michael No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!
oscar I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here.
michael No no no. The only signal that I am sending
is Gay, good.
michael Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just. I would be waving that rainbow flag.
oscar I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
michael You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. oscar is my friend ---
oscar I would rather not.
michael . and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!
oscar No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
michael All right, um. sorry.
oscar Michael. I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on.
michael I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.
dwight michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.
michael You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this. I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here.
michael Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!
michael We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love. anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar. and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
michael I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. . that's what she said. Or he said.
michael Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?
oscar I was going to quit. But jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
dwight "Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice!
oscar What are you doing?!
dwight Shhh. Don't be scared. It works. . oh no.
