pam_beesly I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
kelly_kapoor I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
michael_scott That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
jim_halpert Stop.
michael_scott Um... kay. Uh, alright.
pam_beesly One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
erin_hannon Di-Did you say vampire?
pam_beesly Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.
dwight_schrute Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? 'Cause of the euro.
pam_beesly Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
dwight_schrute Uh...
pam_beesly And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
dwight_schrute NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
jim_halpert Elaborate.
dwight_schrute The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
pam_beesly I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
dwight_schrute Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
jim_halpert So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
dwight_schrute Yes. I would welcome it.
jim_halpert You're welcome.
dwight_schrute The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
angela_martin Jim. Pam. And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. I wish you both a pleasant day. And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
pam_beesly Cece's getting christened today.
jim_halpert Big day.
pam_beesly Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.
jim_halpert Nope.
michael_scott Top of the Sunday morning to you.
andy_bernard And a top of the day to you too, sir.
ryan_howard Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
michael_scott Oh, yes. Doobie-doobie doo.
michael_scott I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
andy_bernard Ah, man.
andy_bernard Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
dwight_schrute For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
toby_flenderson Sunday church service... it's been a few years. The Big Guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
michael_scott Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over.
pam_beesly Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
michael_scott But I'm the Godfather.
jim_halpert It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
michael_scott Are you talking to me?
jim_halpert Ok, your turn.
michael_scott Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
pam_beesly Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
michael_scott I'm not the godfather.
pam_beesly Okay, thank you.
michael_scott So who is the godfather?
pam_beesly Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
michael_scott Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
pam_beesly No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
michael_scott No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
pam_beesly Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
michael_scott I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.
Church#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 congregation We ask you, Lord, come to our aid.
minister_gail Good morning.
all@ Good morning.
michael_scott Good morning.
minister_gail What a terrific day this is, and not just because the Eagles are playing.
minister_gail You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They're leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.
ryan_howard I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
toby_flenderson Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope...
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 church member And thank you for your prayers for Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery.
minister_gail Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance?
dwight_schrute Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
minister_gail Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. We've come to celebrate these babies.
pam_beesly Somebody needs a change.
jim_halpert Right now?
pam_beesly Well, she can't bring this up with her.
jim_halpert Okay. All right, come on. Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
jim_halpert Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Honey, no.
jim_halpert Yes.
pam_beesly No, no.
jim_halpert This is happening.
pam_beesly We have an extra outfit in the bag.
jim_halpert No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
pam_beesly You said you checked it.
jim_halpert I did... say that.
minister_gail At this time, will the families please come join me?
michael_scott Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.
minister_gail Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the "Halberts" have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service.
jim_halpert Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
jim_halpert Okay, "A," Halbert. And, "B," I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests."
ryan_howard For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
kelly_kapoor Try "Jesus."
dwight_schrute Opus dei.
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 church member Hi. Good morning.
michael_scott Good morning.
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 church member Good morning.
michael_scott Good morning.
ryan_howard Hello.
dwight_schrute Shh, shh, shh.
michael_scott How are you? Good morning. Good morning.
sconesy_cider Good morning.
michael_scott I am feeling this. Call it the Holy Spirit or the passion of the Christ. I am loving these people.
jim_halpert Hey.
doug_mcpherson I'm Doug Mcpherson, Davey's uncle.
jim_halpert Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
doug_mcpherson Davey.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Wow.
angela_martin Well, this is intimate.
pam_beesly We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.
angela_martin You don't know them all?
pam_beesly Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
angela_martin Jesus is not your caterer. But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? They don't think.
pam_beesly Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
jim_halpert Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
pam_beesly I don't know. I'm just hungry.
jim_halpert Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
michael_scott Oh, after you.
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 church member Oh, no, after you.
michael_scott No, I insist. After me.
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 church member I'm gonna use that one. Have a good lunch.
michael_scott Thank you. You too.
stanley_hudson This is not the meal I was promised. I'm going to have no energy for the rest of the day.
kevin_malone I cancelled my plans to come to this thing, and they repay me with this?
michael_scott You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch.
kevin_malone With what? How? Sometimes, Michael. Sometimes.
minister_gail Excuse me, everyone, on behalf of the youth ministry that's leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts and tell you about those good-looking guys and gals over there.
ryan_howard Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
minister_gail This is Jessica Ortega. I met her when both she and I were both seven years old when my parents took me to Quimixto on a service trip.
phyllis_vance Who takes a kid to Mexico?
stanley_hudson I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
michael_scott Shh.
minister_gail Right now, Jessica's children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors.
michael_scott No.
minister_gail It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos.
dwight_schrute Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
michael_scott Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
dwight_schrute I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
michael_scott Are you kidding me? Stop it.
dwight_schrute I'll call you back.
minister_gail My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family?
andy_bernard What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
michael_scott Shh.
minister_gail Thank you. Or should I say gracias?
pam_beesly Cece went down.
bob_vance What was this? You're out of it.
jim_halpert Scones.
bob_vance I didn't get one.
pam_beesly Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
bob_vance Is it just the one jug of apple cider?
pam_beesly Who the heck was that?
jim_halpert I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
pam_beesly We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
jim_halpert All right. And cider.
michael_scott Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
stanley_hudson You could feed the hungry. Us.
oscar_martinez Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
michael_scott Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
darryl_philbin We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
michael_scott Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
phyllis_vance Church isn't a party, Michael.
michael_scott Well, it's, it's-
ryan_howard Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
michael_scott No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
jim_halpert Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs.
sylvia Fine, fine. I guess I'll watch Suzanne's purse and your baby.
michael_scott Bye. Good luck. Good luck to you. Bye. Do good. Do good. Bye. Have fun. We're proud of you. Bye. Okay.
michael_scott Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?
Students#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 Yeah!
michael_scott I'll take a shirt.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 Are you coming?
michael_scott If you'll have me, yes.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 Heck, yes.
michael_scott Really? Thank you. All right.
oscar_martinez Michael. Get off the bus.
michael_scott No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.
gabe_lewis Michael, this is irresponsible.
michael_scott It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
darryl_philbin I agree. I think it's superb.
gabe_lewis Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
michael_scott You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
andy_bernard Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico.
michael_scott Hey, right?
phyllis_vance Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
michael_scott Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
phyllis_vance Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
michael_scott Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
dwight_schrute Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
michael_scott No, you may not.
dwight_schrute Gah!
erin_hannon I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
michael_scott Thank you.
andy_bernard Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
andy_bernard I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 We're actually building them a school.
andy_bernard Whatever. I won't-I won't stand for it.
michael_scott See you in a few months.
minister_gail If the whole world were like you guys, we wouldn't have so many problems.
michael_scott Mm. That's not gonna happen.
andy_bernard We're one in a million.
minister_gail I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs and friends and families to do manual labor for three months.
michael_scott Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So...
andy_bernard Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals...
toby_flenderson Why you always got to be so mean to me?
jim_halpert Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
sylvia I don't know. I lost the purse too.
jim_halpert Okay.
andy_bernard Good-bye, Lackawana County.
michael_scott How long till we get to Mexico?
andy_bernard Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
michael_scott Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
andy_bernard I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...
michael_scott Why aren't they building it themselves?
andy_bernard They don't know how.
michael_scott Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
andy_bernard Well, Carla knows.
michael_scott Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
carla Oh, trying to sleep.
michael_scott What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
andy_bernard Do you smell like a weird, warm cheese?
michael_scott Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
andy_bernard And the Christmas party.
michael_scott And Cinco de Mayo.
andy_bernard Nah, no. We'll be back before that.
michael_scott No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
jim_halpert Hey, guys, has anybody seen the baby?
phyllis_vance Here's her carrier, but no Cece.
gerald_halpert Jim, Jim, I want to give a toast. Where's the little girl of honor?
jim_halpert I don't know, dad. I don't know.
doug_mcpherson I don't mean to bug, but do you know when those subs are due into port? I got a hungry bunch of Mcphersons over there.
jim_halpert I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
doug_mcpherson I think maybe some blonde lady had her.
jim_halpert A small blonde woman?
doug_mcpherson Smaller than me.
jim_halpert Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
angela_martin What are you doing?
kevin_malone Give me the baby!
angela_martin What? Kevin!
helene_beesly Hi, honey. I was just changing the baby.
jim_halpert Hi.
pam_beesly Honey.
jim_halpert Hi. All right. Travel safe, Angela.
angela_martin Did you think I stole your baby?
jim_halpert What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
kevin_malone Look at these scones, Jim. Thousands of them. What kind of a person steals scones from a baby?
angela_martin Someone put them in my bag.
doug_mcpherson So that was lunch, eh? Mcpherson troop, let's haul out. Rendezvous at Friendly's.
pam_beesly Did you lose Cece?
jim_halpert Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
michael_scott Can you fake a seizure or a heart attack or something?
andy_bernard I can make myself cry.
michael_scott Do that. Do it.
andy_bernard Should I-I got it. I got it. Um, hey, I saw a sign for a scenic overlook coming up. Really love to check out the view.
Bus#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 driver Can't stop. We're on a schedule.
andy_bernard Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
Bus#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 driver Maybe we'll stop in Tennesseee. It's not safe to talk to a driver.
michael_scott Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on.
Bus#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 driver Stopping in Tennessee.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 Hey, is there a problem, you guys?
michael_scott Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 Why?
andy_bernard Just make him stop the freaking bus!
michael_scott Stop the bus, okay?
carla Are you okay, sir?
michael_scott I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
minister_gail You have plenty left to give. You're doing-
michael_scott Blah-di-blah!
andy_bernard It doesn't matter.
michael_scott We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
andy_bernard If we went to Mexico, we'd probably screw everything up anyway.
michael_scott Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
andy_bernard Stop the bus!
michael_scott and Andy Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 Okay, stop the dang bus.
michael_scott Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.
Another#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 guy Wait for me! Don't say anything to my parents.
erin_hannon Get in quick.
michael_scott Why quick?
erin_hannon So it's faster.
erin_hannon Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
michael_scott Is anyone still at the church?
erin_hannon No, actually most of them went to go see a movie.
michael_scott What? Shut up.
erin_hannon Yeah. Kevin suggested it, and then they all went in Meredith's minivan.
michael_scott It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
erin_hannon I bet. You guys.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 Can I come?
erin_hannon Oh, Lake Wobblegone's on. Do you guys-are you cool with that?
Radio#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode07 "... banana bread, but Fred Nordquist had no appetite. He was thinking about his pair of new boots. It'd been ten years after all. As he told Mrs. Nordquist, it would take two years to get comfortable with the new boots."
