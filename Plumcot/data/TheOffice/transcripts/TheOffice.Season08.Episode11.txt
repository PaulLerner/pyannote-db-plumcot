kevin_malone Oh yeah!
all@ Aw!
dwight_schrute Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
oscar_martinez You really have to say "oh yeah" every time you eat a candy bar?
kevin_malone I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. Oh yeah!
jim_halpert All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
andy_bernard It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
dwight_schrute You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
jim_halpert Okay, done.
erin_hannon Does anyone have a first aid kit?
darryl_philbin Check out this song I wrote I'ma love you downstairs tonight...
jim_halpert All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
andy_bernard Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
jim_halpert You can write a book about chairs.
andy_bernard Books! Excellent, Jim.
oscar_martinez Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
andy_bernard Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper?
jim_halpert Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
andy_bernard I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!
angela_martin Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
andy_bernard Yes!
andy_bernard Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
dwight_schrute Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
philadelphias_trivia_host Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all?
dwight_schrute I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
philadelphias_trivia_host Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please have a seat.
gabe_lewis Dwight? What are you doing here?
dwight_schrute Gabe? You don't know?
gabe_lewis Course I know.
dwight_schrute Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
gabe_lewis Corporate says to me, "Gabe, we need you in Scranton." Scranton says, "Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there." So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
robert_california Dwight.
dwight_schrute Robert.
robert_california You made it.
dwight_schrute Yes.
robert_california Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly.
dwight_schrute Very good.
andy_bernard Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to "play ball." Those were his words.
oscar_martinez Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? Robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
andy_bernard So make that error!
oscar_martinez Andy, no-
kevin_malone Hey! I can make that error.
oscar_martinez Aw...
andy_bernard Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
kevin_malone No, I-
andy_bernard It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. What do you say?
oscar_martinez I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
andy_bernard Oh.
oscar_martinez Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
andy_bernard What?
oscar_martinez It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
andy_bernard You know what? Go. Have fun.
andy_bernard There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
jim_halpert Stop right there. I love it.
darryl_philbin I'm in.
andy_bernard I didn't even say what it is.
darryl_philbin It's trivia.
jim_halpert In Philadelphia.
andy_bernard But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...
jim_halpert That's a great idea.
darryl_philbin That's a great plan.
andy_bernard Yeah? You like it?
jim_halpert Yeah.
andy_bernard All right.
jim_halpert All right, good stuff.
andy_bernard I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, "this sounds really stupid."
darryl_philbin You just made a good idea, a great idea.
andy_bernard There is one problem with this plan.
darryl_philbin What?
andy_bernard We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
gabe_lewis You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right.
dwight_schrute Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
gabe_lewis Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question What's the most important appliance in your house?
dwight_schrute Meat grinder.
gabe_lewis Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
dwight_schrute You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
robert_california Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
dwight_schrute But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
robert_california No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight.
gabe_lewis CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
dwight_schrute Still an important position. Still a chief.
gabe_lewis You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. Hallway phone, Gabe Lewis speaking.
robert_california Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.
gabe_lewis Your wish is my command.
robert_california It's a command.
oscar_martinez I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
andy_bernard You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
oscar_martinez What? No!
andy_bernard I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
oscar_martinez And you guys thought this was a good idea?
jim_halpert I thought it was a fun idea.
darryl_philbin There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
andy_bernard Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?
oscar_martinez Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
all@ No. Nah.
oscar_martinez What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night?
andy_bernard It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. Not anything.
oscar_martinez Good luck.
andy_bernard Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
meredith_palmer Good-timers follow me.
phyllis_vance Backups.
stanley_hudson Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
andy_bernard A-team.
jim_halpert Okay.
andy_bernard All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except...
kevin_malone Okay.
jim_halpert There's a table over here.
philadelphias_trivia_host All right, first question everyone Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital?
andy_bernard Oh, we got this!
creed_bratton Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
stanley_hudson Atlanta.
phyllis_vance Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
cathy_simms My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
stanley_hudson Keep talking all you want.
kevin_malone How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
erin_hannon Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
philadelphias_trivia_host Okay, time's up. Let's get the boards up. "Atlanta, Georgia" is the correct answer.
gabe_lewis Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
dwight_schrute There's no fires within eight miles of here.
gabe_lewis Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
dwight_schrute What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
philadelphias_trivia_host This must be very frustrating.
gabe_lewis I can see you in the jungle now.
philadelphias_trivia_host Okay, now, you're not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you?
andy_bernard Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.
jim_halpert Shawn Marion.
darryl_philbin Yes, Shawn Marion.
ryan_howard That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
jim_halpert Wrong, for so many reasons.
phyllis_vance Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
stanley_hudson That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
kevin_malone Ron Artest, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
philadelphias_trivia_host All right, boards up. Let's see who got it. "Lamar Odom" is what we were looking for. "Lamar Odom" Thank you.
jim_halpert Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
kevin_malone Nicely done!
andy_bernard You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.
darryl_philbin Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
dwight_schrute So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
philadelphias_trivia_host Well, you got my vote.
dwight_schrute Oh my God.
gabe_lewis I know.
dwight_schrute Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
gabe_lewis What?
dwight_schrute What's with the smile?
gabe_lewis You're doing great. You know, so good.
dwight_schrute And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
gabe_lewis Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! Ow!
dwight_schrute Take me to Robert.
gabe_lewis Ow! He went home.
dwight_schrute Take me to his house.
gabe_lewis Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
dwight_schrute You know where it is. Lead me there.
gabe_lewis Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!
dwight_schrute Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
philadelphias_trivia_host Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir?
ryan_howard Yeah?
philadelphias_trivia_host I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account... but you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules.
ryan_howard Okay, I'm turning it off.
philadelphias_trivia_host Okay, you're not turning it off.
ryan_howard I won't look at it.
philadelphias_trivia_host Sir?
ryan_howard I can't- I can't not touch it.
philadelphias_trivia_host Okay, then we're going to have to take it away. Thank you.
ryan_howard Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone.
philadelphias_trivia_host All right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. The Queerenstein Bears have seven points. Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points.
jim_halpert All right.
philadelphias_trivia_host D.M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points. Ladies Gaga have five points.
andy_bernard So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
dwight_schrute Which one is it?
gabe_lewis I don't know. All I know is the building.
dwight_schrute Robert! Robert California! Robert!
robert_california Dwight! How nice of Gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.
philadelphias_trivia_host All right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins.
kevin_malone Oh yeah!
kelly_kapoor What!
philadelphias_trivia_host In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears.
Queerenstein#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode11 Bears Whoo! Let's go!
philadelphias_trivia_host And, in first place, is Aesop's Foibles.
Oscar'sfriend#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode11 Whoo!
darryl_philbin Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
philadelphias_trivia_host Ring it in when you know it. First question This man had a fatwa declared on him when- Einsteins?
meredith_palmer What?
erin_hannon What is it?
meredith_palmer What?
erin_hannon I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl.
philadelphias_trivia_host Aesop's?
oscar_martinez Salman Rushdie.
philadelphias_trivia_host Salman Rushdie is correct. Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what?
meredith_palmer Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
erin_hannon Flying jib.
philadelphias_trivia_host Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins.
robert_california Shalom. Give us just a minute. Stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle Stu once a month.
stu Grab my knee!
gabe_lewis Yay Robert!
robert_california Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.
philadelphias_trivia_host According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents.
Oscar'sfriend#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode11 Boom! ADHD!
philadelphias_trivia_host No.
meredith_palmer Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
philadelphias_trivia_host That's correct for the Einsteins.
andy_bernard Whoo! Yeah!
philadelphias_trivia_host Sir-
andy_bernard Go Einsteins!
philadelphias_trivia_host Dial it back, this isn't Tail Feathers, okay?
robert_california They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?
dwight_schrute No thank you.
robert_california Sit down, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, "table for one?" How is this possible?
robert_california You were dining alone? All those people are you?
dwight_schrute Yes, exactly. Riddle number two Who is going-
robert_california Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?
dwight_schrute N... it's complicated.
robert_california This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better?
dwight_schrute It's a job interview, not a flea market.
robert_california Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.
dwight_schrute Yes.
philadelphias_trivia_host Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you're ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body.
andy_bernard Oh, come on!
philadelphias_trivia_host The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight?
kevin_malone Three hundred pounds!
philadelphias_trivia_host Point for the Einsteins. Here's your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory berets This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray.
oscar_martinez Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon.
Oscar'sfriend#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode11 Yes!
philadelphias_trivia_host I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins.
kevin_malone Les Jolies Choses.
meredith_palmer Are you sure?
kevin_malone Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
philadelphias_trivia_host The Einsteins win it!
oscar_martinez No! Come on!
kevin_malone Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of trivia a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one.
stonewall_alliances_trivia_host Host Welcome to the Stonewall Alliance Trivia Championships! First prize is forty-five hundred dollars!
kevin_malone Let's just do our thing, collect our hardware and get the hell home.
stonewall_alliances_trivia_host Host Riboflavin.
kevin_malone Riboflavin?
stonewall_alliances_trivia_host Host Michigan. The President of the United States is "P.O.T.U.S." John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath.
