michael Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day. everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me. " Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So.
jim So, you ready for the. the Dundies?
pam Ugh.
pam You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
michael Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.
jim What?
michael Fat Halpert. jim Halpert.
michael So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?
jim Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
michael Oh, that's a good idea.
dwight Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
michael Gyaaah. T. M. I. T. M. I my friends.
michael T. M. I. ? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T. M. I. I used to say "Don't go there" but that's. lame.
michael And here we have stanley the Manly. Now stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.
stanley I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
michael Oh, no you di-int.
stanley I think I did.
michael W-why did you.
stanley Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember?
michael Yes we should. I. you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, someone had eaten all of them.
michael To oscar Martinez it's the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah!
pam michael has taped every Dundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights.
oscar That's supposed to be confidential.
michael He has the award-ah! . it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
michael A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of angela on the thing.
michael . a little bit of phyllis everywhere.
pam Oh, yeah, this is the part where kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
michael . a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers. . a little bit of jim with some ribs, a little bit of.
kelly It was you.
phyllis Live and learn.
pam It wasn't. I swear.
kelly Yeah, it was.
dwight So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
pam We're not laughing at you, Dwight.
dwight So who are we laughing at?
pam Um, just something somebody wrote.
dwight Who? Dave Barry?
kelly No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
dwight What is it? Who wrote it?
pam Um, it's kind of private.
phyllis It's about Michael.
dwight That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
pam Okay, now I'm laughing at you.
michael Will her highness, jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
jan It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
michael Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
jan No.
michael Wuh. Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So.
jan No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so. we're not paying for this.
michael Um.
michael Could you. ?
jan Are you there Michael?
michael Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
michael Um, what, ah, what is, I mean.
michael . come on, Jan!
michael You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
jan Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
michael Well, yeah, I mean, what is.
jan You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
michael No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party.
jan And you had a luau. .
michael . it happens once every billion years.
jan And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
michael Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
jan Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
michael Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
michael This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. "Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin. " Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just. wish people were going to be drunk.
phyllis Dwight, get out of here!!
dwight No, no, no, no.
phyllis What were you doing in the ladies room?!
dwight . no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
phyllis Why were you peering over the stalls?!
dwight No, why were you in there?!
phyllis You are a pervert!
dwight What were you doing in there?
phyllis You, are, a pervert!
dwight I am not.
michael The Dundie award for "Longest Engagement" goes to pam Beesley.
michael Pam, everybody!
michael Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.
roy Yes.
michael Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?
roy Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
michael Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
michael I'm not changing that, it's the best one.
jim No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, "world's longest engagement", um, we're all expecting it, you know?
michael That's why it's funny. Every year that roy and pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
jim Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
michael Oh, lazy. Uh huh.
dwight Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
pam You're taking away our bathroom?
dwight We are going to have two men's rooms.
phyllis But where would we. go?
dwight Be prepared to hold folks From 9 am to.
pam Michael.
michael Yes.
pam . dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
michael Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
dwight Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions.
michael Just don't, don't talk-
dwight . for people's behavior.
michael Don't talk-
dwight And it's-
michael Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
michael Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
dwight Yes!
michael Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
dwight Best Dundies ever.
dwight Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
dwight Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. Devon!
michael "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello. " Card!
oscar The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
michael "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"
dwight The waitress tripped on the cord.
michael Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. I am your host, michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!

dwight Yeah?
michael And I was about to take her bra off.
