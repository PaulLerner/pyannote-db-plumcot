dwight_schrute Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
michael_scott My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
jim_halpert Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
michael_scott Uh... try "password".
jim_halpert Nope.
dwight_schrute Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
jim_halpert Okay, I'm not doing every number.
pam_beesly Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
michael_scott Uh... it was like eight years ago?
pam_beesly Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
erin_hannon Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
jim_halpert Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
michael_scott Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
andy_bernard I got it, try, um--
michael_scott You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
kevin_malone Big Boobs.
meredith_palmer Drama Queen?
angela_martin Nosy?
pam_beesly You're typing "Big Boobs"?
jim_halpert I'm trying everything.
dwight_schrute Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z".
jim_halpert That's-- the password. We're in.
dwight_schrute All Right
kevin_malone Wow.
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
michael_scott Morning.
ryan_howard How's It Going?
ryan_howard Hey, I'm WUPHF.
michael_scott I'm Facebook.
ryan_howard What's up Facebook?
michael_scott I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.
ryan_howard You should've sent me a WUPHF.
michael_scott A what?
ryan_howard When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time.
Robotic#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode09 Voice WUPHF.
ryan_howard and Michael WUPHF!
michael_scott Dot com!
ryan_howard Thanks Erin.
erin_hannon Sure.
erin_hannon Pam.
pam_beesly Mm-Hmm?
erin_hannon I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
pam_beesly Okay.
erin_hannon Ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
pam_beesly Oh, it's okay.
erin_hannon But it's not for--
pam_beesly Let it go.
pam_beesly Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
michael_scott I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
ryan_howard I love it.
michael_scott I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
ryan_howard Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
michael_scott Your kidding?!
ryan_howard We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
michael_scott You and me.
ryan_howard New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
michael_scott Don't you work here full-time?
ryan_howard Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
michael_scott Mm-Hmm.
ryan_howard Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
michael_scott That does sound fun to me.
ryan_howard Awesome.
dwight_schrute Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
dwight_schrute Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! Watch it, watch it.
dwight_schrute Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode09 Don't forget to make a broom.
dwight_schrute Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2 00, and the Goat Roast is at 3 00. Come on in, enjoy!
angela_martin Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
dwight_schrute Roll in the hay, five dollars.
angela_martin No, I meant...
dwight_schrute Oh, our contract.
angela_martin Mm-Hmm.
dwight_schrute Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
angela_martin Perfect!
dwight_schrute So, uh... Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
jim_halpert All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. Whoo!
jim_halpert I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob... I can pretty much sell anything.
kevin_malone Commission comes out to... dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
jim_halpert Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.
kevin_malone I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
angela_martin You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
jim_halpert What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
angela_martin It's a new corporate policy.
kevin_malone Dunh-duh-na-dah!
gabe_lewis Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
jim_halpert A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
gabe_lewis When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
jim_halpert Nope.
gabe_lewis Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
jim_halpert Okay.
gabe_lewis My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just-- keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
michael_scott Excuse me, everyone... s*x! Now that I have your attention...
stanley_hudson You don't have our attention.
michael_scott MONEY!
stanley_hudson I'm listening.
kevin_malone You had me at "s*x."
michael_scott Pervert.
phyllis_vance You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
michael_scott That's good to know.
pam_beesly What do you want to say, Michael?
michael_scott Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
ryan_howard How's everybody doing?!
michael_scott Whoo!
ryan_howard Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you.
stanley_hudson Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M.L.K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
ryan_howard For my current investors, things are going great.
michael_scott We already have a buyer.
pam_beesly Really?! Who?!
ryan_howard Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
michael_scott At least.
ryan_howard So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
phyllis_vance Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies.
oscar_martinez Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
ryan_howard No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
michael_scott That's right!
ryan_howard Fun, communication, connection.
oscar_martinez What's your money situation?
ryan_howard Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
oscar_martinez Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
ryan_howard We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
andy_bernard I'm sorry, nine days until what?
oscar_martinez Bankruptcy?
michael_scott Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
oscar_martinez How long do you think a week is?
michael_scott No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
jim_halpert Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So... what now?
jim_halpert Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.
pam_beesly Did you prank Dwight?
jim_halpert No.
pam_beesly Well, you like that.
jim_halpert Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
pam_beesly I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
jim_halpert
pam_beesly Oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
ryan_howard Check this out.
erin_hannon All that color.
michael_scott Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
andy_bernard Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
ryan_howard Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
michael_scott There you go.
andy_bernard You have his email?
ryan_howard A lot of these guys are just Mac.com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
stanley_hudson I want my money back.
michael_scott Do not talk like that, Stanley.
pam_beesly Ryan, just tell us your plan.
ryan_howard Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
dwight_schrute Hey kids, was that fun?
Kids#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode09 Yeah!
dwight_schrute All Right!
Kid#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode09 I wanna go on it again.
dwight_schrute Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks.
dwight_schrute Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
angela_martin
angela_martin Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
dwight_schrute Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
angela_martin No, I--I think you should make time for it.
Little#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode09 Girl I found the needle in the haystack!
dwight_schrute Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
Little#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode09 Girl I don't know!
dwight_schrute Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
angela_martin Dwight?
ryan_howard WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
michael_scott Here we go.
ryan_howard Everyone's like, "Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?" Or, Uh, "Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!"
michael_scott "It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
ryan_howard "Yo, Ry from WUPHF!"
michael_scott "He's up there."
ryan_howard "What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!" WUPHF condoms! 50,000 condoms out of the sky!
michael_scott Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
darryl_philbin Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?
ryan_howard The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
andy_bernard That sounds weird.
michael_scott No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
kelly_kapoor Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
kelly_kapoor I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I.M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'"
ryan_howard Baby, Baby, Baby--
kelly_kapoor I think I'm gonna stay here.
ryan_howard No, no, no, no, no.
kelly_kapoor I do, I do. This isn't right.
ryan_howard I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
kelly_kapoor But I--it's not right.
ryan_howard I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
darryl_philbin Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
ryan_howard The Washington University Public Health Fund.
darryl_philbin W.U.P.H.F.
pam_beesly Oh, God!
darryl_philbin They only want it for the initials.
ryan_howard The domain name. Yeah, they do.
pam_beesly I move we sell!
mother_harvest What?
darryl_philbin Yeah, sell!
andy_bernard Yeah, sell.
pam_beesly Sell.
stanley_hudson Get us out of this!
ryan_howard Have some faith in this idea!
darryl_philbin If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?
michael_scott I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
ryan_howard Yes. You alone do, actually.
michael_scott I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
kevin_malone Awesome!
cameron Do you mind if we share this bale?
angela_martin Sure.
cameron There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?
angela_martin Probably.
cameron I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?
angela_martin Mm-Hmm.
cameron I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.
angela_martin Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. Don't laugh at me.
cameron No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke.
angela_martin Oh.
cameron Pay Place.
angela_martin Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day.
cameron That's humorous.
angela_martin Thank You.
kevin_malone You guys know how to get out?
pam_beesly Hi, Michael.
michael_scott Can't talk, saving the planet.
pam_beesly Oh, we don't recycle.
michael_scott We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
pam_beesly I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
michael_scott Eight Years.
pam_beesly Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
michael_scott No, I won't even consider it.
pam_beesly Michael, I... I hate to say this, but... you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
michael_scott Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
pam_beesly Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
michael_scott I think you are wrong.
pam_beesly And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
michael_scott You may be right. I may be crazy.
pam_beesly Don't.
michael_scott I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
pam_beesly Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
michael_scott I thought it might make me feel better.
pam_beesly Okay. Go Ahead.
michael_scott But it just may be a lunatic... No.
jim_halpert Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
meredith_palmer Hey, back off. It's Solitare.
creed_bratton Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work.
jim_halpert Talk to me.
creed_bratton How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? Good.
gabe_lewis Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
creed_bratton We're working.
gabe_lewis Can you at least try to look busy?
jim_halpert
jo_bennett "The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, "You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat." The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. "I love you, you Gay b*st*rd," I said. "You Gay b*st*rd," I s--. "Gay Ba--" "Gay B--""
ryan_howard Michael, how's it going, bro?
michael_scott Good, good, bro.
ryan_howard Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
michael_scott Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
ryan_howard I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
michael_scott Nine days, though. That's, like...
ryan_howard Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
michael_scott Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
ryan_howard Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
michael_scott Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
ryan_howard Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
michael_scott So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
ryan_howard Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
michael_scott Mm-Hmm.
ryan_howard Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
michael_scott Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
ryan_howard We totally should.
michael_scott Tonight?
ryan_howard I gotta work on this.
michael_scott Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
ryan_howard Yeah.
dwight_schrute And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. And let's hear it for... Purebred. Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!
dwight_schrute Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
cameron So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss Angela Martin, would I get through to you?
angela_martin You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
cameron My wife passed away a few years ago.
angela_martin How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
cameron Thank You.
kevin_malone Help! Hello?! Oh! Help!
darryl_philbin Consider it a WUPHF in person.
andy_bernard Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
darryl_philbin You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
andy_bernard If you tell Michael to sell, he'll sell.
ryan_howard I'm betting on myself.
stanley_hudson It's a bad bet.
michael_scott Hello.
ryan_howard Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
darryl_philbin It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you.
andy_bernard All those in favor of selling, say aye.
michael_scott I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
darryl_philbin What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
stanley_hudson Michael, are you that blind?
michael_scott I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
andy_bernard You're gonna lose all of our money.
michael_scott Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
ryan_howard Oh... Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
michael_scott You can't have it.
ryan_howard Okay. I won't let you down.
dwight_schrute Angela? Angela!
michael_scott The world sends people your way... Ryan came to me through a temp agency. Andy was transferred here. No idea where Creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. Jim, that guy is an ace. Dwight is my King up my sleeve. Phyllis is my old maid. Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So... That's Uh...
Robotic#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode09 Voice WUPHF, from Ryan Howard. Decided to sell company. Thanks, bro. Hell of a ride.
michael_scott Thank God.
jim_halpert
gabe_lewis Gabe Lewis.
jo_bennett Now listen here, Gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them.
gabe_lewis Well, Jo--
jo_bennett Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay b*st*rd. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty. But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my--
jim_halpert All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
jo_bennett I've always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--
