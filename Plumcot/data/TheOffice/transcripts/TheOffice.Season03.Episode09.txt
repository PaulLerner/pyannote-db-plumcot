pam_beesly Ohhhh! She's absolutely adorable!
hannah_smotridgebarr He.
pam_beesly ...Oh, sorry. He's--he's dressed all in pink.
hannah_smotridgebarr That's his favorite color.
pam_beesly ...Oh. That's... fun for him.
stanley_hudson Fantastic.
michael_scott Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
hannah_smotridgebarr Thank youuu.
michael_scott Ohh. May I?
hannah_smotridgebarr Uh, sure!
michael_scott Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from "Look Who's Talking." What am I thinking? Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
karen_filippelli Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
karen_filippelli ...Almost done?
jim_halpert Just about... yup. Now.
jim_halpert Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.
michael_scott Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.
angela_martin Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.
jan_levinson Mmhmm.
angela_martin Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.
jan_levinson We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.
michael_scott I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist. ... I'm just kidding.
jan_levinson When did the check come?
angela_martin Last week.
jan_levinson Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.
angela_martin One of the Stamford people is a criminal?
michael_scott Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
angela_martin Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?
jan_levinson Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.
pam_beesly Who is it?
michael_scott Hannah?
kevin_malone Hmm.
angela_martin Hmm.
kevin_malone Andy.
angela_martin Andy?
kevin_malone Hmm. Martin?
michael_scott Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
kevin_malone Wait, why am I a racist?
michael_scott Because you think he's black.
kevin_malone He is black... right? And...
michael_scott Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
jan_levinson ...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.
kevin_malone Yeah!
jan_levinson Michael?
michael_scott Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.
kevin_malone I wonder what he did.
michael_scott In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
pam_beesly Why would anyone go to jail for that?
michael_scott Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
kevin_malone Cool.
pam_beesly Okay. Angela?
angela_martin Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.
michael_scott Good. All right.
jim_halpert Jim Halpert.
andy_bernard I am so horny.
jim_halpert ...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
andy_bernard Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna. Tell me about that Indian chick, Kelly. She seems pretty slutty. Good for a romp in the sack.
jim_halpert She is dating Ryan, I think.
andy_bernard Oh, and I care why?
jim_halpert She's... high-maintenance.
andy_bernard Next. How about... . Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.
jim_halpert Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
andy_bernard Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?
jim_halpert ...Absolutely you should.
andy_bernard Jackpot.
michael_scott Just... try to be cool.
dwight_schrute I am cool.
michael_scott Okay, are you cool, really?
dwight_schrute I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
michael_scott Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
dwight_schrute I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
andy_bernard All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?
jim_halpert I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...
jim_halpert Frisbee-based competitions...
andy_bernard Are you kidding?
jim_halpert She...
andy_bernard I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.
jim_halpert Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
michael_scott Hey Martin, how's it going?
martin Good. Getting settled, you know?
michael_scott Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
pam_beesly My dad.
michael_scott ...Danny Glover. Yeah.
jim_halpert Jonas Salk.
michael_scott Who?
jim_halpert Justin Timberlake?
michael_scott Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
karen_filippelli Hey I got one.
michael_scott Yup.
karen_filippelli Jesus.
michael_scott Apollo Creed.
michael_scott Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.
martin So... you all wanna know what I was in for?
michael_scott No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
martin Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink.
michael_scott That is awesome.
kevin_malone I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.
pam_beesly What was prison like?
martin Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.
kevin_malone You got outdoors time?
martin Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games...
kevin_malone Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?
pam_beesly Yeah, some days I never go outside.
michael_scott Well, we are running a business, so.
meredith_palmer What was your cell like?
martin Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes.
pam_beesly They have art classes?
martin Yeap. Yeah.
ryan_howard They have business classes there?
martin They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business.
pam_beesly Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.
michael_scott Ah. Well. That's not true.
kevin_malone I would so rather be in prison.
ryan_howard Prison sounds great.
michael_scott No you would not.
michael_scott This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.
creed_bratton Baby. Hello baby. Here you want to play with this?
karen_filippelli You can't give paperclips to a baby. He could swallow.
creed_bratton Oh, it's okay. I've got tons of them. You like that? Goo-goo-goo-goo?
andy_bernard Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around. Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?
pam_beesly Wow... I--
andy_bernard Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.
pam_beesly Wow. That was... wow.
michael_scott Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!
pam_beesly Michael, it's freezing out.
phyllis_vance I can't feel my toes.
michael_scott Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
jim_halpert What is that, like... five pounds?
michael_scott It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
stanley_hudson I'm going back inside.
michael_scott Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
michael_scott Oh heyyy. Martiiin. You have TV in the joint?
martin Yeah, in the rec room.
michael_scott Ah. A ten inch black and white?
martin Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.
michael_scott These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.
jim_halpert Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.
andy_bernard Yeah.
jim_halpert Quick question - do you play the guitar?
andy_bernard I play the banjo.
jim_halpert Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
andy_bernard You know I can, my man.
jim_halpert Yup. That's perfect.
karen_filippelli Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
andy_bernard I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.
jim_halpert Perfect.
karen_filippelli What is going on?
jim_halpert ...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
karen_filippelli I love it. I want in. Who's the target?
jim_halpert ...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...
karen_filippelli Perfect. What do I do? Just give me an assignment.
jim_halpert Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
michael_scott All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say "Boo" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!
angela_martin Do you really expect us to believe you're somebody else?
michael_scott Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?! All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you. You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
ryan_howard Michael, please.
jim_halpert Where... did you learn all of this?
michael_scott Internet.
jim_halpert So, not prison.
michael_scott And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
jim_halpert What'd you do, Prison Mike?
michael_scott I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
jim_halpert That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
michael_scott And I nevah got caught, neither.
jim_halpert Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.
pam_beesly Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?
michael_scott Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
andy_bernard Wow. Prison sounds horrible.
michael_scott Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
dwight_schrute Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
angela_martin Don't encourage him, Dwight.
michael_scott The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
karen_filippelli Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?
michael_scott No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life. So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?
pam_beesly Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.
martin Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison.
michael_scott Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.
jim_halpert Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.
michael_scott No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.
kevin_malone Hey! Let us out of here! Hey! I have--
hannah_smotridgebarr Shh!
toby_flenderson This is Toby. Hey Pam. Where are you calling from?
toby_flenderson Michael. Why's everyone locked in the conference room?
michael_scott They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
toby_flenderson Well, you're going to have to let 'em out. Or... or I will.
michael_scott Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
toby_flenderson You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.
michael_scott Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
michael_scott Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.
andy_bernard So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
