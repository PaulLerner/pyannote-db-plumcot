michael_scott Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
dwight_schrute Michael?
michael_scott Yes?
dwight_schrute I've got a treat for you!
michael_scott Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
dwight_schrute Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
michael_scott Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
dwight_schrute That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Hah!
michael_scott Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
dwight_schrute What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
michael_scott I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? The job was not mine to give. Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
dwight_schrute Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
michael_scott Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
dwight_schrute Great idea.
michael_scott ...in order to feed the bears.
dwight_schrute Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
michael_scott How do you mean?
dwight_schrute Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? You're like a giant walking salami!
michael_scott Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
dwight_schrute Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
michael_scott Okay.
deangelo_vickers You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
michael_scott Hm?
deangelo_vickers I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
michael_scott Well I have interviews.
deangelo_vickers That's nice. How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. You okay?
michael_scott Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
deangelo_vickers You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
michael_scott Oh you don't, that's-
deangelo_vickers I will be in the break room.
michael_scott That sounds good. Thank you.
deangelo_vickers Dead man walking.
michael_scott Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
gabe_lewis Stay away from Erin!
andy_bernard Hey!
gabe_lewis I'm your boss!
andy_bernard Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
gabe_lewis No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
andy_bernard Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
gabe_lewis No! You go away!
andy_bernard Hi Tuna.
jim_halpert So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
phyllis_vance How about cupcakes?
angela_martin Please.
pam_beesly What's wrong with cupcakes?
angela_martin Everything.
michael_scott There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
pam_beesly Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
pam_beesly We thought.
angela_martin It's an experiment.
phyllis_vance The three of us have all been chairmen before.
pam_beesly So this is the dream team.
meredith_palmer Hey! What are you saying?!
angela_martin The dream team... and Meredith.
meredith_palmer We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
michael_scott Mmm!
phyllis_vance Yeah that was a surprise...
michael_scott You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
pam_beesly Should we get toppings?
michael_scott What do you like Pam?
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott What kind of toppings would you like?
pam_beesly Hot fudge?
michael_scott Sounds good. Fudge it up!
michael_scott I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. I still need something to drink out of though.
michael_scott Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Please Michael.
michael_scott When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. And she still is.
phyllis_vance I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
phyllis_vance Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
michael_scott Ahh.
phyllis_vance It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
michael_scott Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind.
phyllis_vance It's cute.
michael_scott Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
stanley_hudson Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
michael_scott Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.
andy_bernard Wow.
stanley_hudson Yeah wow!
andy_bernard You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
michael_scott But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
phyllis_vance What does that even mean?
michael_scott You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
andy_bernard I'm gonna lose 'em.
michael_scott You're not gonna lose them.
andy_bernard I promise you that I will.
michael_scott Just do your best! I have faith in you.
stanley_hudson Gimme those clients!
andy_bernard No.
phyllis_vance Do you believe that?!
dwight_schrute I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
deangelo_vickers I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it.
michael_scott Kevin, I have something for you.
kevin_malone Oh!
michael_scott You know who that is?
kevin_malone Oh...
michael_scott Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
kevin_malone Better...
michael_scott Good, stand up. You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
kevin_malone But...
michael_scott You will find love.
kevin_malone Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
michael_scott Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
andy_bernard I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
michael_scott Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this.
oscar_martinez Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
michael_scott It looks like a It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
michael_scott Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have s*x at some point?
angela_martin It was just you...
michael_scott How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
oscar_martinez State Senator.
michael_scott Mmhmm, bravo!
oscar_martinez Brava!
angela_martin You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
michael_scott Sure!
angela_martin Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
michael_scott Who's that? Who's that guy?
angela_martin Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
michael_scott I guess this could be the one, huh?
angela_martin Yeah.
andy_bernard Hey.
deangelo_vickers Hey!
andy_bernard I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
deangelo_vickers Let's rip it up homes.
gabe_lewis Walk away bitch.
oscar_martinez Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
michael_scott My last pay check?
oscar_martinez You have an address yet in Colorado?
michael_scott No.
oscar_martinez What town do Holly's parents live in?
michael_scott I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
kevin_malone Sounds beautiful!
pam_beesly You should do more stuff like that.
kevin_malone I'm going to!
jim_halpert Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
michael_scott Nah, I'm almost done.
jim_halpert You sure?
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
kevin_malone Finally! That old shredder sucked.
pam_beesly It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
kevin_malone Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
pam_beesly It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
kevin_malone I know...
jim_halpert Did you break the shredder Kevin?
kevin_malone No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. Just get one that'll shred magazines.
pam_beesly I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
michael_scott I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come.
holly_flax Hello there!
michael_scott Hi. What is the name of our town?
holly_flax Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
michael_scott No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
holly_flax Oh you mean this?
michael_scott Yes. Yes my hero!
holly_flax I'll pay the rent! Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
michael_scott Ohh, I miss you.
holly_flax Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
michael_scott Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
holly_flax I love you too.
michael_scott Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. And I have said goodbye to half of them.
toby_flenderson Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
michael_scott Okay.
toby_flenderson Okay.
michael_scott Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
kelly_kapoor What?!
michael_scott If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
kelly_kapoor Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
michael_scott She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
ryan_howard Wow.
michael_scott Yeah.
ryan_howard This is... totally unnecessary.
michael_scott You're not prone to seizures?
ryan_howard No.
pam_beesly So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
meredith_palmer Erotic.
angela_martin See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
phyllis_vance Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes.
meredith_palmer I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
angela_martin Good God...
meredith_palmer They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
pam_beesly I don't, I don't think we sh-
meredith_palmer I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
pam_beesly Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
phyllis_vance As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
pam_beesly You know what, I think we should get some other input.
kelly_kapoor I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
phyllis_vance Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
angela_martin No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
michael_scott Um, Pam.
pam_beesly Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
michael_scott Okay...
erin_hannon Gabe!
gabe_lewis I need to talk to you!
erin_hannon You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
gabe_lewis Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes.
erin_hannon Hey Creed.
creed_bratton Not cool man.
erin_hannon I really think you should leave.
gabe_lewis Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
erin_hannon Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
gabe_lewis Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one.
erin_hannon Gabe!
gabe_lewis Okay...
toby_flenderson Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
rory_flenderson I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him.
toby_flenderson Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
rory_flenderson Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.
toby_flenderson Well, no. He hates jams.
michael_scott Darryl!
darryl_philbin Hey.
michael_scott I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
darryl_philbin That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
michael_scott Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
darryl_philbin No. Can't let you do that Mike.
michael_scott No problem. Worth a try.
michael_scott Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode21 Guy No.
michael_scott Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip.
deangelo_vickers okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? Hmm?
andy_bernard I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
deangelo_vickers That's stupid.
andy_bernard What do I know?
deangelo_vickers What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
andy_bernard Yeah.
deangelo_vickers Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
andy_bernard Yeah!
deangelo_vickers 'Cause if you do now's the time.
andy_bernard Alright.
deangelo_vickers Not while I'm driving.
michael_scott Catch you guys- Catch you guys on the filippity flip. Flippity flip! Flippity flip! Really? Okay, see ya guys!
deangelo_vickers You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
andy_bernard No. I don't.
deangelo_vickers I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.
andy_bernard Awwhh, wow.
deangelo_vickers Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! Yeah! Again.
andy_bernard Oh, okay...
deangelo_vickers Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! You hear me?! You feel that energy?
andy_bernard Mmhmmm.
deangelo_vickers Wooo! Yeah! Okay, again.
erin_hannon I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
michael_scott Kevin?
erin_hannon Andy.
michael_scott Ahhhh...
erin_hannon I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
michael_scott Maybe neither.
erin_hannon I'm not attracted to Kevin.
michael_scott Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
erin_hannon Extension 147.
michael_scott N-
erin_hannon I know.
michael_scott Okay.
phyllis_vance You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
michael_scott Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
phyllis_vance No. I'm on a sale!
michael_scott Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
phyllis_vance Okay...
michael_scott Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow.
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation.
dwight_schrute This is gonna be good. To whom it may concern. Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. The dictionary defines superlative as of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. Ohhh, yeah.
dwight_schrute
michael_scott
deangelo_vickers I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. But I can say this He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, Andy's not your guy. You ever play Russian Roulette? Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year.
jim_halpert Ahh, what happened to you?
michael_scott You should see the other guy.
dwight_schrute
michael_scott Jim where is Pam?
jim_halpert Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
michael_scott But it is already three o'clock!
pam_beesly
michael_scott Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
michael_scott Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
michael_scott And you, why are you still here.
gabe_lewis I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
michael_scott No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite.
deangelo_vickers That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
andy_bernard Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
deangelo_vickers Okay whatever.
andy_bernard Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
dundies_guest Keep talking.
deangelo_vickers Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. You'll never guess, we did it!
andy_bernard Hey! Good job boss!
deangelo_vickers We did it!
michael_scott Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this!
stanley_hudson Yes, what is this about?
michael_scott What is this meeting about?
stanley_hudson Mmhmmm.
michael_scott Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
phyllis_vance They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
michael_scott Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
stanley_hudson Is that it?
michael_scott Umm, hmm?
stanley_hudson Is that it?
michael_scott Ummm... Hm... No. No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
jim_halpert Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
michael_scott Sure. Be right out!
jim_halpert So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
michael_scott Ohh...
jim_halpert What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
michael_scott Okay...
jim_halpert You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
michael_scott Maybe.
jim_halpert Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
michael_scott Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
jim_halpert Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
michael_scott T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. You started with this company, as a fine young man...
jim_halpert You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
michael_scott Oh, okay.
jim_halpert And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had.
michael_scott Oh shoot! That's my cab.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott Alright.
jim_halpert Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
michael_scott I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
jim_halpert I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
michael_scott I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
jim_halpert You got it.
michael_scott Okay... Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Oh no, they're still not done.
michael_scott No no no, let me see. Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em.
creed_bratton See ya tomorrow boss!
michael_scott Later guys.
michael_scott Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
michael_scott Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. That's what she said!
pam_beesly No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
deangelo_vickers Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. I for one love the corners. Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. What am I doing? Come on DeAngelo!
dwight_schrute Uh oh...
