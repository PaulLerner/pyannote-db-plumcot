michael So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
oscar Who is this guy again?
michael Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are. the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
ryan Who uses calling cards anymore?
michael You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
oscar This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
michael Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
toby Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
michael You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? . Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. Alright.
jim No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
michael Alright, let me explain. Again. Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a. it's not even a scheme per se, it's. . I have to go make a call.

kelly Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and he had skin cancer too.

pam I can sign for it. Delivery
woman Oh. Thanks.
michael When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids. and. I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me. for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
michael Stop it. Stop! What is that?
dwight It's 'For the Longest Time, ' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
michael Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
dwight I probably care more than she does.
michael You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .
pam When does he hear?
jim Sometime today.
pam Ohh. poor Kevin.
pam If I knew I had a week to live, I would. probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And. I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. . It would be a pretty busy week.
dwight Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on back. order. Michael! Michael! michael michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!
michael What?
dwight Listen up everyone! It is 11
 23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so. huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
michael Ohhh, God.

michael Ohhh, no.
dwight So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
oscar . I'll do it.
michael Ohh, no, no, no! I can't. Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
dwight Creed! Come on. Stanley!
pam . I feel like we should go get kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
jim Maybe, but. we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and.
dwight On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
michael Okay.
dwight Happy birth moment, Michael.
michael Thank you.
dwight One. Two. Three!
michael Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it. please.
dwight Oscar.
oscar It wasn't me. . push;
dwight Okay, that is not an eight foot sub. Delivery

dwight F. Alright, what's the damage? Delivery
boy Uh, thirty-nine sixty.
dwight Thirty nine. sixty.
dwight Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because. I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
dwight Here they come.
michael Get in here. everybody.
dwight Come and get it!
michael Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
oscar What is this?
dwight Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
michael The best.
stanley These are all the same?

angela No.
michael Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
angela No.
michael Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. And choke on it.
michael When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So. That was the worst birthday I think I ever had.
jim So. We got Kev some stuff. Um. a party pack of M&amp;M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
pam Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
jim Which we realize sounds crass, but, it. is his favorite number.
pam And his favorite lunch.
dwight Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left .
ryan Someone ate three feet of that thing?
dwight Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
angela Oh. Thank you.
dwight Oh. I got it.
angela What are--- it's. the party planning committee.
dwight This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.

dwight But what if i'm hungry?
angela No cookie.

jim . Okay. Office
staff Happy birthday dear Michael, Happy birthday. . tooo youuuu.

michael Uhhh. blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm.
dwight Yaoo yay!
michael . I asked for trick candles.
dwight pam was supposed to get 'em.
michael Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
angela No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
michael . Aww, that. sucks, great. . Wow, that's good timing. That's. that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible. terrible news for both of us .
pam We should probably head back.
jim Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
pam You dare me? How old are you?
jim Just. quit stalling.
pam Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
jim Such a dork.
pam jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you. Store
employee Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.
pam Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
jim How old are you?
pam I hate you.
toby Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s. just. it's terrible.
michael There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
kevin Still scary.
michael Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
kevin Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
michael And laughter. also.
toby I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
michael Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
toby I work here.
michael Nyeh, I work here. Alright, well, you know what, since toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I. think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
kevin If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
michael Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy. crazy with worry.
dwight Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
jim Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
dwight Please, don't.
jim You. owe me.
michael Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
stanley Is this trip related in any way to your. birthday?
michael How dare you sir. You are gross.
michael That should not be there.
dwight I'll get someone to take it down.
michael No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
kelly Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
ryan Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
jim Think you can let go?
pam No.
jim Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
dwight YEAH!
pam Who is that?
jim Is that Michael?
michael Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
pam I got it.
michael Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin. um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
jim . It's something to think about.
kevin I can't relax about it, you know?
michael Kevin. You heard anything yet?
kevin No, not yet.
michael Okay. Well. Live strong.
kevin Okay, Michael.
michael Alright.
carol Michael?
michael Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or.
carol Uhh, no, I. don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
michael Oh, these. all your kids?
carol No just the front two.
michael Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
carol Sure.
michael Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
michael Push. Good! That's great. You got it. Excuse me.
kevin Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. It was negative.
michael Oh. God. God! We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna. come here .
michael Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would. be. chaos.
kevin This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
michael Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
dwight Turn it around. Turn it around.
michael Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
dwight Number one!!
