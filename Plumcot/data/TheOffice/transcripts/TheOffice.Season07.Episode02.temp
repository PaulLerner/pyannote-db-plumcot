dwight Wow. Late every day this week.
pam We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic.
dwight Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
jim Is there really?
dwight Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center. Ha ha ha Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
dwight Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
jim Aaah!
mose Aaah!
dwight You remember my cousin Mose.
mose Welcome children.
pam Were you painting in the dark?
jim Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
dwight Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
pam I don't really think we need.
jim Oh. lets take the tour Pam.
pam Yeah.
dwight Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English. uh. letters. I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
jim These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
dwight Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and. Ms. Fork.
pam And a soy sauce packet.
dwight Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
jim Don't beat yourself up.
dwight We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
jim Who will be watching the children?
dwight No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
jim Prove it.
dwight What?
jim Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
dwight Oh no, no, no.
jim But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
dwight I promise you, that door locks!
toby What's something that you.
michael This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
michael Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is . um . worse than hell.
toby michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
michael I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?"
toby We can do this with more privacy.
michael So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
dwight Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
phyllis The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
dwight All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
ryan America is one big mall.
jim Did something happen Dwight?
dwight Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
andy Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
dwight You don't want to know.
toby I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
phyllis I'm glad michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
pam Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
jim Pam?
pam I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
jim Everything is going to be ok.
pam Tell me I'm good at sales.
jim You're good. you're good at sales.
pam The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
andy Dwight?
dwight What?
andy Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word?
dwight Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
stanley No you will not.
dwight Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists!
jim Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
pam Yeah, what happened Dwight?
jim Ok.
dwight You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall.
pam So what happened?
dwight I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
kelly You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to "Pretty Woman" their asses.
creed We should start our own mall!
erin Yeah!
jim Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
kelly What did I say?
kelly I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
jim Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
andy No, you and I. and I. I'm going to come with you.
dwight Ok
jim Alright.
andy Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? How about now? How about now? How about now?
toby Uh. what was your favorite flavor of.
michael One hour.
toby What?
michael One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
toby Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
michael No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
toby Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly.
michael You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
toby Tell me!
toby I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
michael Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
dwight Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl.
andy Pretty Woman.
dwight Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this s*x worker, who is the antagonist. That can't be right. Andy? How does it. ?
jim No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
dwight Ok, Um. The s*x worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going.
andy Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like, " I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me. " And the shop girl goes, "ok". And Julia Roberts goes, " You girls work on commission, right?" And the girl is like, "Yeah", and Julia Roberts goes.
kelly "Big mistake! Huge!"
andy I was telling that. I was telling that.
stanley How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure. Window treatment
guy Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?
erin I don't know. Window treatment
guy Is one of you the office administrator?
pam I am. I am the office administrator! Window treatment
guy Can I show you a few samples?
pam Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
pam There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
michael Toby, can I really tell you anything?
toby Of course.
michael Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my pen1s. I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah. weird. I think that was . I was probed. By an alien life form. An A. L. F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
oscar Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
pam A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
oscar Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
pam Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
oscar Totally, that's great.
pam I get paid $40, 000 per year.
oscar Great.
pam Maybe $50, 000.
oscar $50, 000?
pam No, not $jim Before me stands your coworker, dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning dwight into a gentleman.
andy A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
stanley Is he still doing his boycott?
jim No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
kelly You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
jim Agreed.
dwight Really?
oscar Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
dwight Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
ryan The glasses are a little.
pam I liked them.
kelly I thought they were kind of cute.
ryan Yeah, I liked them too.
dwight I can't see.
darryl Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that.
dwight Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?"
darryl I'm telling you how to do this man.
andy If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
angel Please and thank you go a long way.
dwight Copy. Thank you.
angela Thank you.
dwight Please.
andy I think he's got it!
michael And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?
toby Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
michael Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? Three hours. We're half way done.
toby Oh.
pam Hey, do you have a second?
gabe Yeah.
pam Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
gabe Right, of course!
pam And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
gabe Thank you so much.
pam I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
gabe Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
pam Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
toby You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
andy 
jim We present to you for your comments and approval, dwight K. Shrute.
phyllis Go get 'em Dwight.
jim Wish us luck!
dwight Thank you.
erin dwight
erin Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
toby We can play something more complicated if you like.
michael This is plenty complicated.
toby So you have played it before?
michael I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
toby Who's Jeff?
michael Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
toby So, her husband, your stepdad?
michael Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
toby Did you guys do much stuff together?
michael Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
toby It's working. I'm doing it!
angela 
dwight What?
angela My place tonight. Wear this.
dwight Do you have your card?
angela Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
toby Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
michael I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
toby Why?
michael I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
toby Dogs don't do that.
michael Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
toby I don't know.
michael When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so.
toby It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
michael Well, lets not get too. This isn't a counseling session. Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
toby I'm just trying to help you Michael.
michael You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
toby I just want to.
michael You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
toby Just fill them out any way you want.
michael Ok.
toby I'll have erin fax them back to corporate.
michael You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these and call me in the morning.
pam Hey Michael, um. about three months ago, I was talking to.
pam There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
gabe So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
toby Yes.
gabe That is not how it seems to me.
toby He seems fine.
gabe You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
toby Heh.
darryl I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
pam We can do that.
darryl Right in here?
pam Easily.
gabe I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
pam But of course!
gabe Great.
gabe The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
pam So weird that there is no paperwork.
gabe At all.
pam Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
gabe Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit. admit.
pam Admit what?
gabe I don't want to say it.
pam Say it.
gabe Mm-hmm.
pam Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
gabe Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.
pam Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
gabe Will do. Can I get one of those name plates. that says gabe Lewis?
pam Sure. Anything else?
gabe Nope.
pam I'll get it right away.
pam The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2
 00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
jim Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
dwight It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
jim Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
dwight Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
jim That's it.
salesman Let me know if I can help you with anything.
dwight Excuse me sir.
salesman Yes?
dwight I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
salesman I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that.
dwight You work on commission, don't you?
jim Stop, stop, stop.
salesman No, we don't.
jim Did you just say you remember him?
salesman Of course, but he looks much less threatening now.
jim What does that mean?
salesman We had a safety concern. Um. we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back.
dwight Good Morning!
salesman If he were in accordance with our dress policy.
dwight What?
salesman But the blood stained hands.
dwight It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi.
salesman I'm very sorry.
dwight Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a. I'm gonna. Ok. Listen. You can't treat. Thank you! Good morning sir!
jim Lets just go.
dwight You made a big mistake. Huge!
jim There it is. Alright.
dwight Aaah!
jim That's pretty good.
andy After you.
dwight I'll take the wizard!
salesman Oh, ok!
michael You forged them! You forged the forms!
toby You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
michael Yes.
toby You remember that.
michael Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
toby Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
michael You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake. Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet. "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!" Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
