jim Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
andy Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?
andy What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
andy How'd it look?
jim You've seen it, right?
andy No.
pam Andy, somebody defaced it.
andy What? Morning, Stanley.
jim There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a. phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and andy gave them that opportunity.
andy Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
erin Six months.
andy Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
meredith Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
andy Which one did you see?
meredith Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
jim Okay, don't be gross.
dwight What's going on?
pam Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
dwight Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
andy Yeah, Dwight.
dwight No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOO!
dwight Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
ryan Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
dwight It's simpler this way.
oscar It's really not.
andy Now, stated arrival time is 3 p. m.
kelly I don't get the reason for this party.
phyllis Yeah, what's the reason?
kelly What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?
andy It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
andy You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
andy Few other super simple reminders – no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
darryl What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
andy I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all. step it up.
oscar Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
phyllis Yeah, it's just a picnic.
andy This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.
darryl There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
andy Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
pam How is that better than a barbecue?
ryan What's the dress code on this?
andy I'm glad you asked – Connecticut Casual.
stanley Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i. e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
andy Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.
kevin Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.
darryl I've seen this, that's not you.
meredith Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
andy It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so. Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
jim Ah, and did robert California get an invite to your party?
andy Yeah, of course. Ye. I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did.
phyllis Why didn't you just say this was to impress robert California?
gabe I cannot believe that andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
andy See you all there at 3 p. m, Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
dwight And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
jim So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view.
dwight They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
jim Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
dwight There's so much more to it than that.
dwight I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars.
jim I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. I've only sold one copy.
angela Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
pam Nope.
angela I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
pam Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
angela Phillip?
pam Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
angela Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
pam Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
angela It's after my cat.
robert Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.
andy Ooh, that sounds great.
robert Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.
andy Sure.
robert You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.
andy Uh, I'll hear the other one.
robert It's a basil plant.
andy You know, the marmalade sounds great.
robert I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.
andy Then the basil will be fine.
robert Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright.
toby Hey, where do I park?
mose I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.
toby Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
mose I'm the. I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.
toby It's probably okay.
mose Give me your car.
toby I think it's better that I.
mose Give me your car.
toby It's a finicky car.
mose Get out. Have a good time at the thing.
toby It's a little tricky, you might have to. take.
dwight MR. RYAN HOWARD!
jim Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
dwight STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
andy How's it going over here, guys?
oscar Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.
andy Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.
oscar Wow.
dwight MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
walter So, you all work with Andy.
andy Well, technically FOR Andy.
oscar Technically FOR robert California. He's our CEO.
ellen I thought you were the CEO.
andy I don't know how you got there.
walter You said you were running the company.
andy This branch, I'm the regional manager.
walter Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers?
andy Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
andy Can I introduce you around now?
walter Uh, yeah, we don't have too long, we have theater tickets.
andy What are you going to see?
walter Money Ball. walter Jr. 's choice.
andy What?? walter
jr Hey Bronard!
andy I didn't know you were going to be here. walter
jr I wouldn't have missed it.
erin Ahh! walter
jr I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother.
jim Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim. walter
jr Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife pam .
jim No.
meredith Hell no. She wishes.
jim No, no, no, no, no. No.
waiter Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests.
kevin I understand. . push;
dwight Set that down. Present yourself.
jim Chapter 4 – One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
dwight LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
robert Hello Andy.
andy Welcome.
robert Thank you.
andy Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
robert Yes, hello, nice to meet you.
walter Pleasure.
robert Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?
andy Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
robert No, I'm certain you said basil.
ryan This is not funny, man, let me down.
kevin I think this thing is broken.
ryan It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
andy So pretty today.
ellen It's getting chilly.
walter We really should be leaving.
andy Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
andy Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
andy Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
darryl Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. robert California!
gabe I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
angela I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
pam I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
angela She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
ryan I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides.
erin I think we should toast.
dwight Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
jim Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
kevin Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To robert California.
gabe I would also like to toast robert California. Mr. California. .
andy You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
robert I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy.
andy Yeah, yeah.
robert You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers.
gabe To robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you.
andy Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. walter Baynes Bernard Sr, please report to the stage!
walter I'm eating, Andy.
andy Ah, come on!
walter Okay. Okay.
andy Yes!
walter What do you want to do?
andy Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?
walter Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It's a little tricky.
andy Saying I love you is not the words.
walter It's too high.
andy Yeah?
walter It's high but it's not that high.
andy Right, it feels strange.
walter Just take it down a little.
andy Saying I love. Saying I love you.
walter Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like. Saying I love you is. andy &amp;
walter . not the words.
walter You don't come in yet. . I want to hear from you, It's not that I want you. andy &amp;
walter . not to say it but if you only knew. More than words is all you have to do to make it real.
andy Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
erin It's either taping or calling. andy &amp;
walter What would you do if my heart was torn in two.
walter You know what, walter Jr. is here. Why don't you come up and join us? walter
jr Dad, no. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here.
meredith Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo! walter &amp; walter
jr May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you'd have done to you.
andy Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar. Erin's Cell
phone If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
erin Sorry.
kelly I am so cold.
ryan That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
dwight My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
robert Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
dwight Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
robert Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?
dwight I can get you exotic meats – hippo steaks, giraffe burgers.
robert We'll talk.
dwight It'll all be goat.
andy Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.
walter Hi. What was that display?
andy I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.
walter Andrew.
andy I know, I know that you're proud of me.
walter I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man, don't act like a little boy who needs.
darryl I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
oscar Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
darryl Rosebud?
oscar It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
darryl I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
oscar Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
darryl No. You're wrong.
robert Are you sure?
ryan Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
robert My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.
walter It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food.
ellen Sandwiches were dry. walter
jr Bye Tuna, bye Pam!
andy Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
darryl Cheeseburger or hamburger.
andy Um, cheeseburger.
oscar Narddog.
andy Thanks, Oscar.
pam What are they doing?
jim Closing ceremonies.
pam Nice touch.
jim I think I left my wallet in your house.
dwight Who cares.
jim Right here.
dwight MR. JAMES HALPERT!
jim Keys, keys.
dwight Stop forgetting things.
jim I didn't forget them, they're right here.
dwight MR. JAMES HALPERT!
jim I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing.
dwight What? Idiot.
jim Whoo.
dwight MIS. MI. What are you doing?
jim Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
dwight That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
