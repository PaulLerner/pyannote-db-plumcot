michael_scott It is six a.m. and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
deangelo_vickers Yes, and this happens every...?
michael_scott Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
deangelo_vickers Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.
michael_scott Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
michael_scott Alright let's go! This way, this way!
deangelo_vickers Thanks.
michael_scott Surprise!
deangelo_vickers Congratulations!
jim_halpert Yep, okay...
michael_scott You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Here we go! Have Pam come down.
jim_halpert No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
pam_beesly What's going on?
jim_halpert Stay in bed!
michael_scott Congratulations!
stanley_hudson Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
michael_scott We got it.
deangelo_vickers Uh, leave it at the door or...?
michael_scott Yeah that's fine.
michael_scott Hey Toby! You suck!
deangelo_vickers Is this an employee of ours?
michael_scott Go go go go go go!
michael_scott I've never seen this place in the daylight.
deangelo_vickers It reminds me of Katrina.
michael_scott Here we go, alright got it? Set? Hello?
meredith_palmer I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
deangelo_vickers Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
meredith_palmer Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
michael_scott Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
meredith_palmer No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. Let me fix you breakfast!
deangelo_vickers I'm not going in there.
michael_scott Go.
michael_scott Good morning Erin.
erin_hannon Oh hey, didn't see you.
michael_scott You have big plans for tonight?
erin_hannon I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!!
michael_scott You are getting so funny! Very good.
michael_scott The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
michael_scott Anything can happen at the Dundies! They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
dwight_schrute Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
michael_scott Black tie optional.
dwight_schrute Every day is black tie optional!
michael_scott A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
kevin_malone Nice!
phyllis_vance I love their breadsticks!
pam_beesly Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
ryan_howard I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
pam_beesly Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
ryan_howard I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
pam_beesly You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad.
michael_scott Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
ryan_howard Yeah that's great.
michael_scott So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. And that person is DeAngelo!
dwight_schrute Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
deangelo_vickers Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
michael_scott Think of it as part of your training.
deangelo_vickers Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...
michael_scott Okay, well we'll work on it.
deangelo_vickers Michael, I'm very, very bad.
michael_scott You are doing it.
michael_scott Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
kevin_malone Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
michael_scott Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
deangelo_vickers That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
michael_scott Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
deangelo_vickers This did not happen.
michael_scott Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. Ryan how are you today?
ryan_howard Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
michael_scott There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.
deangelo_vickers Uhhh, you sir! Are we having fun tonight?
jim_halpert Having a great time.
deangelo_vickers Oh good!
jim_halpert Thanks, yeah.
deangelo_vickers Where were you on September 11th?
michael_scott No! God!
deangelo_vickers This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously.
andy_bernard Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
michael_scott No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
jim_halpert Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
michael_scott Jim, please no loopholes.
darryl_philbin Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
michael_scott This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
deangelo_vickers Me mo. Me mo.
michael_scott Good. Good. Good!
deangelo_vickers Meee Mo, Mee!
michael_scott Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
deangelo_vickers When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
michael_scott Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. Let's try this. Put these on. I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, and make it sound perfect.
deangelo_vickers THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!
michael_scott Say it with an accent!
deangelo_vickers THE DUNDIES!
michael_scott The Dundies!
deangelo_vickers THE DUNDIES!
jim_halpert I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
pam_beesly Yeah... Hey, Erin, everything okay?
erin_hannon Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
jim_halpert Who's gonna see us?
erin_hannon Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
jim_halpert Get in the car?
erin_hannon Please! Sorry. Get in. Sorry sorry sorry.
pam_beesly What's wrong?
erin_hannon I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
pam_beesly Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
erin_hannon I, really don't like spending time with him.
pam_beesly Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
jim_halpert I think I'm gonna go.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert I think you got this. Kay? Alright. Feel better!
erin_hannon Thank you Jim.
jim_halpert I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
erin_hannon I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
pam_beesly Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him.
dwight_schrute
kevin_malone Hi!
dwight_schrute Appalling. Eye sore. Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
erin_hannon DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
deangelo_vickers Hello?
"Jo"#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host!
deangelo_vickers Oh no!
"Jo"#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 Luckily I have someone for you!
deangelo_vickers Billy Crystal?
"Jo"#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 Better.
deangelo_vickers Neil Patrick Harris?
"Jo"#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi!
deangelo_vickers Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, Get Him to the Dundies!
deangelo_vickers Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?
"Angela"#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Audience#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20
deangelo_vickers Mmhmm.
angela_martin Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
oscar_martinez
oscar_martinez Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
deangelo_vickers Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
"Jim"#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
jim_halpert
deangelo_vickers No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time!
"Phyllis"#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 Well, what are you talking about? Ohh! Ohh! I've fallen and I can't get up!
deangelo_vickers Maybe I just need to look into my heart. DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott.
michael_scott I'm here. In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
oscar_martinez The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
dwight_schrute Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! Was that part of the...?
michael_scott DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
deangelo_vickers Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.
michael_scott No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
deangelo_vickers This was not, part of the job description!
michael_scott Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
deangelo_vickers Who am I doing this for?
michael_scott You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say It's showtime. Get out there.
deangelo_vickers I can't.
michael_scott Say it.
deangelo_vickers Stop, hitting me.
michael_scott You can do it, just say it.
deangelo_vickers Hit me again.
michael_scott Now hit me. One, two, three.
all@ It's showtime.
michael_scott Alright, here we go.
michael_scott Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line.
deangelo_vickers Fall asleep right after s*x. Huh guys?
jim_halpert Nope, go back to the script.
michael_scott There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!
jim_halpert Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
michael_scott Well done.
jim_halpert I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
michael_scott Alright.
pam_beesly You didn't think to mention me huh?
jim_halpert Didn't I?
michael_scott Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
meredith_palmer Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
dwight_schrute Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
jim_halpert I gotta go do this.
pam_beesly Why?
dwight_schrute Big smiles folks! There they are.
michael_scott Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, Danny Cordray! Danny couldn't be here tonight...
ryan_howard How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
michael_scott Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! Come on up here you sick b*st*rd.
phyllis_vance I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
deangelo_vickers They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. No, I hate this, I hate it so much. Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. This is for you trashcan!
Manager#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 Who gave you those crayons?
kevin_malone I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Manager#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 This is a cloth tablecloth! You can't color on it!
kevin_malone Oh really? 
michael_scott You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award!
meredith_palmer That is bull!
erin_hannon Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
gabe_lewis What?
erin_hannon I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? Thank you for hearing me.
gabe_lewis Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. Alright I'm gonna go.
michael_scott There you go.
darryl_philbin Damn that was cold.
michael_scott It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers.
Audience#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
deangelo_vickers Hold on, hold on one second. I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!
Manager#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 Okay, okay.
deangelo_vickers THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
michael_scott DeAngelo is expressing himself. 
deangelo_vickers This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!
michael_scott Okay, we're done! That's it.
deangelo_vickers Michael, are we?!
michael_scott We're done. We're done!
michael_scott So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
pam_beesly Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
michael_scott What?
deangelo_vickers I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
michael_scott No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
pam_beesly Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.
michael_scott So what you're saying is you kinda like it? I've fallen and I can't get up! That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
jim_halpert I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
michael_scott That got a big laugh.
jim_halpert That did. Pretty huge laugh.
michael_scott You were laughing right?
stanley_hudson I was.
deangelo_vickers You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
michael_scott We're really close.
deangelo_vickers I can just run over to the gas station.
dwight_schrute We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
michael_scott That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
deangelo_vickers Okay, fine I'll hold it.
michael_scott You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
dwight_schrute I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
michael_scott Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
dwight_schrute Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
deangelo_vickers Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
michael_scott What is your problem?!
dwight_schrute I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
michael_scott Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
dwight_schrute And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
deangelo_vickers Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here.
michael_scott He is in an all-out sprint.
michael_scott Here... Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard!
andy_bernard A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
michael_scott Oh, okay.
andy_bernard I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
darryl_philbin
michael_scott Oh my God, something's happening.
andy_bernard Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
all@ Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's how many minutes, that you've worked here.
pam_beesly In costumes!
jim_halpert And impressions!
toby_flenderson In meetings.
erin_hannon and Kelly And cups of coffee.
kevin_malone For birthdays!
stanley_hudson More meetings and-
Women#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode20 E-Mail forms you made us read.
all@ Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!
meredith_palmer You hit me with your car!
ryan_howard You helped me get off drugs!
creed_bratton I watch you when you sleep.
oscar_martinez I forgive you for kissing me!
all@ Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.
kelly_kapoor and Erin Call, text or e-mail, or call.
deangelo_vickers Measure your life in love!
all@ Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.
michael_scott Yeah, okay. Well this is gonna hurt like a mother.
deangelo_vickers Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!
michael_scott No it's not.
oscar_martinez It's his last Dundies.
jim_halpert You gotta play along man.
oscar_martinez Come on Toby.
michael_scott Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!
toby_flenderson I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
