jim This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.

michael Hello, good morning.
pam Good morning.
michael You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
michael Well, pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. Oh that, well, that is Pam. pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
pam He brought a sled.
michael No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so. Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and pam is my hot roadie.
pam Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
michael Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
pam Separate rooms.
michael Well that goes without saying.
pam I'm going to say it anyway.
michael Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's.
pam This is a new cardigan.
michael . kind of Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
pam No.
michael No. Oh, all right.
jim Hey, Kelly.
kelly Screw you.
dwight Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
kelly Oh yeah? Screw you too.
jim Whoa! What was that all about.
phyllis You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
jim Go ahead.
dwight Go ahead, you do it.
jim Okay.
dwight I insist.
jim Basically after phyllis blackmailed Angela, michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
dwight What he said was.
jim Just, easy.
dwight . there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
jim Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
dwight I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. That's on my side.
jim So this is fun.
kelly My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
pam Can I turn on the radio?
michael No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
pam But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
michael Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
pam That's dangerous.
michael Well then. hey you know what then let's just talk.
pam That's okay I can. I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
michael You nervous about seeing karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so.
pam No, that was a long time ago.
michael Is that why your wearing makeup today?
pam No, I'm not even wearing that much.
pam I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But karen knows me, and she still hates me, so.
julia Oh, this is a nice office.
stanley You don't have to lie. Through here.
andy Um Phyllis, who's that?
phyllis She's out of your league Andy.
andy For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
phyllis Sexually?
andy This conversation is over.
andy I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
jim We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
kelly Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
dwight If you say screw you one more time.
kelly Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
dwight Hey, HEY.
jim Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
kelly I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
dwight Oh God.
jim Okay.
kelly In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
dwight What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
kelly Ice Cream.
pam Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
michael Hello, Rolando, how are you?
rolando Hi.
michael Rolando, I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
rolando Uh, your late, everyone's already in the conference room. karen will be right here to take you over.
michael Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.

karen Let's just get this over with, shall we?
michael Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
jim Are you kidding?
dwight Well, I'm not done yet.
jim Dwight. This, fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
dwight They match the carpet
jim What is that? It is your birthday period.
dwight It's a statement of fact.
jim Not even an exclamation point?
dwight This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
jim I can't believe how bad this looks.
dwight Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
jim Okay, good then.
dwight Have you collected the money from everyone?
jim I am working on it.
dwight How much do you have?
jim Six dollars.
dwight That's how much you and I contributed! I. Damn it Jim!
jim I said I was working on it.
dwight . push;
andy Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! Whoa! Aah, Aah!
michael NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you. This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. . No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
karen Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
michael I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
karen But now we think you're a liar.
michael Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?
michael I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
michael I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. "M" your name is Mark.
mark Yes.
michael Got it. It works.
karen Uh, it's very insulting.
michael But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
mark But we already know each other's names.
michael Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
karen Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.
michael Oh, I still have more.
karen Can I please see you in my office, please?
michael She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, let's go.
julia I can't accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget.
andy Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather.
stanley Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
andy Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
stanley Are you out of your damn mind?
andy Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.
stanley We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
andy We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.
stanley You really like her, huh?
andy Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
stanley Give me two clients for her.
michael I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre. "
karen No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.
michael No, don't worry, the chain is off.
pam No it's not.
karen You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
michael Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
pam So when are you due?
karen Uh, in about a month.
pam Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
karen Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
michael It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
karen Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
michael Oh, great.
karen His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
pam Oh, he's cute.
karen Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
pam What is happening there?
karen Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.
pam It's really sweet.
michael No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
karen So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
pam Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
karen That's so great. That's great.
pam Thank you.
karen Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you.
michael Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
stanley I have to take care of a couple things. So andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
andy So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
julia No, it could go straight to our business address.
andy Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
julia Actually, I, I don't have a boyfriend.
andy Really? Is that. wow, that's so weird.
andy Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
oscar Oh, my desk is over.
creed This gal, she's really into you?
andy Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
creed All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
andy Okay, it sounds risky.
creed Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?
andy Wait, what?
michael I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
pam I like her.
michael Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
pam I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
michael Why?
pam Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and. Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
julia Thanks for walking me out.
andy Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so.
julia You must be freezing.
andy I am about to die. Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
julia Oh, no, it's okay. This is my car.
andy Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
julia What's a "Nard-Dog"?
andy This is the Nard-Dog.
julia Whoa. What the hell?
andy Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
julia I just got out of a relationship too. It's really hard.
andy Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
julia No, I, I don't think so.
andy Sure, yeah that's. your right. It's too soon for. definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
julia Okay.
andy Take care Julia.
julia Thank you.
andy Sorry I tried to kiss y.
andy We lost the account.
dwight Damn it! dwight Schrute.
jim How old's Kelly?
dwight Who is this?

dwight Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
jim Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
dwight Uh, 24. 37.
jim Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?

pam Are you asleep?
michael No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H. R. ?
pam No, remind me.
michael Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
pam Perfect boobs, of course I remember Holly.
michael She was the love of my life. What you and jim have times 100. Just she. she just left. And I didn't. I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
pam Okay, lets go.
michael I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.

michael Okay.
jim So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
