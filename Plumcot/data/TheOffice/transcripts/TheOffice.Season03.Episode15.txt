jim_halpert Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
dwight_schrute What do you think?
jim_halpert In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
jim_halpert Dwight, want an Altoid?
dwight_schrute Okay.
jim_halpert Altoid?
dwight_schrute Sure
jim_halpert Mint Dwight?
dwight_schrute Inbwit? Yes.
dwight_schrute
jim_halpert What are you doing?
dwight_schrute I...
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.
michael_scott Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
photographer Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just Phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great.
michael_scott Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.
phyllis_vance Yes, I put Michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
pam_beesly Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
jim_halpert So what's in the box?
stanley_hudson A toaster, you?
karen_filippelli A toaster.
stanley_hudson Unbelievable.
dwight_schrute Hello, Angela.
angela_martin Hi, Dwight.
dwight_schrute You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
angela_martin Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
dwight_schrute The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
jim_halpert Those flowers are nice.
karen_filippelli Yeah. P and R?
jim_halpert Phyllis and Robert.
karen_filippelli Ah, of course.
pam_beesly Also, Pam and Roy.
michael_scott There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
phyllis_vance Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
michael_scott How you doin'? You excited.
phyllis_vance Yes, very.
michael_scott Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
phyllis_vance No.
michael_scott You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...
phyllis_vance That wasn't me.
michael_scott Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
phyllis_vance I thought it was...
michael_scott Here, let me...
phyllis_vance Michael... No.
michael_scott Just cover up that bald patch.
phyllis_vance I don't need your... thank you. No, Michael please... I just need some time alone.
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
michael_scott I hate you!
michael_scott Long story short Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
dwight_schrute Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
jim_halpert You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
dwight_schrute No way.
jim_halpert Did you ever see that movie?
dwight_schrute Of course I saw it.
dwight_schrute I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
jim_halpert You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
dwight_schrute Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
kevin_malone Hi. I'm Kevin. Where did you find her?
toby_flenderson At the gym.
kevin_malone Riiight. The gym.
kelly_kapoor Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
meredith_palmer I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
kelly_kapoor I know but there was an emergency.
kelly_kapoor I look really good in white.
michael_scott This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.
pam_beesly That's my dress.
michael_scott That's ok.
dwight_schrute It's a miracle.
all@
michael_scott This is bull****!
michael_scott Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.
michael_scott I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
minister And do you, Phyllis, take Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband?
phyllis_vance I do.
michael_scott Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
minister And do you, Bob...
michael_scott Oh, shiii...
minister ... take Phyllis to be your lawfully wedded wife
bob_vance Vance I do.
minister You may now kiss the bride.
michael_scott Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
angela_martin Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
phyllis_vance Thanks Angela.
michael_scott Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.
bob_vance Vance If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you.
michael_scott Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
dwight_schrute Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
phyllis_vance I don't have that, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Dammit, Phyllis!
kelly_kapoor Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
pam_beesly What do you mean?
kelly_kapoor Well... this was supposed to be your wedding.
pam_beesly Oh... um... no. That's... um... That's actually fine
kelly_kapoor There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
pam_beesly Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
dwight_schrute 'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
uncle_al Al Who?
dwight_schrute The bride and groom? What are their names?
uncle_al Al Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure.
dwight_schrute Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
uncle_al Al Okay, Okay. Where are we going?
dwight_schrute Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
uncle_al Al Oh!
michael_scott Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
phyllis_vance It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
michael_scott I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
phyllis_vance It's fish.
michael_scott I will take care of that.
michael_scott I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.
kevin_malone No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
kevin_malone Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
roy_anderson Hey.
pam_beesly Hey.
roy_anderson I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh... This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? Phyllis has got some great taste.
pam_beesly You're kidding me, right?
roy_anderson I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um... Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
pam_beesly Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
roy_anderson I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
pam_beesly Yeah.
roy_anderson Sorry about that.
pam_beesly It's okay.
roy_anderson You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
randy Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler!
all@
Unknown#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode15 She is.
randy Cheers.
all@ Cheers.
michael_scott Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige...
michael_scott The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.
michael_scott Phyllis and Bob their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her... and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob... Bob Vance...
bob_vance Vance Oh okay. That's enough.
michael_scott is a guy that...
bob_vance Vance Thanks, Michael. Give me...
michael_scott he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
bob_vance Vance Give me the microphone.
michael_scott No. I'm not going to...
bob_vance Vance Give me... Give me the microphone, Michael.
michael_scott Ok. All right.
bob_vance Vance You're out of here!
michael_scott Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Hey!
jim_halpert When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
pam_beesly Oh... I'm pacing myself.
jim_halpert Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
pam_beesly No. I'm such a dorky dancer.
jim_halpert I know. It's very cute.
jim_halpert Hypothetically, if I thought Pam was interested, then... No, it's totally hypothetical.
michael_scott Come... Come on!
dwight_schrute I can't let you in, Michael.
michael_scott Dwight, just...
dwight_schrute No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
michael_scott Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
dwight_schrute You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
michael_scott OK.
roy_anderson Hey, they're playing our song.
pam_beesly Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
roy_anderson I know. Uh... I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
michael_scott ee... I was meant for you... buppity du bom bu.
roy_anderson Hey, want to get out of here?
jim_halpert Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
karen_filippelli Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every...
Women#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode15 One... Two... Three. Ahhhh!
toby_flenderson Toby! Yeah!
michael_scott I just want Phyllis to have a great day.
uncle_al Al Phyllis and you will be great together.
michael_scott We are great together. We are a great team.
uncle_al Al The Celtics were a great team.
michael_scott Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.
uncle_al Al Nobody ever helped me. I had to do it myself. Even the doctor didn't know!
michael_scott Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
michael_scott Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just... I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
phyllis_vance You found Uncle Al!
michael_scott Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
phyllis_vance Thank you, Michael.
michael_scott You're... You're welcome.
michael_scott They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
michael_scott Be careful. Oh no!! Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!
