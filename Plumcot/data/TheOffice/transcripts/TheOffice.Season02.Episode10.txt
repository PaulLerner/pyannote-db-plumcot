dwight_schrute Go. Get the door.
michael_scott Here we are.
dwight_schrute Go. Push!
michael_scott Oh god.
dwight_schrute Push!
michael_scott No, no, turn it around.
dwight_schrute Really shove it.
michael_scott You'll break it.
dwight_schrute Shove it through! Break it!
michael_scott You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
michael_scott All right.
dwight_schrute I got a splinter.
michael_scott Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! Nice, huh?
dwight_schrute I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
michael_scott On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
dwight_schrute One, two, three.
michael_scott Merry Christmas!
michael_scott Did it work?
kevin_malone Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?
michael_scott A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
kevin_malone But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?
michael_scott Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.
jim_halpert So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.
angela_martin Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
phyllis_vance Yes, I got those cute little ones. Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?
angela_martin We'll see.
ryan_howard Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.
michael_scott Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?
angela_martin Fifty.
michael_scott Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
michael_scott It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
michael_scott I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.
pam_beesly You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.
michael_scott Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
kevin_malone & Oscar One, two, three.
dwight_schrute You guys should use a hand truck.
kevin_malone Do we have one?
dwight_schrute No.
angela_martin Will you help me?
michael_scott No! No way! It... no.
darryl_philbin Come on, Mike, let me borrow the hat for just a couple of hours.
michael_scott You wanna be Santa?
darryl_philbin Yeah.
michael_scott Have you ever seen Santa?
darryl_philbin Yeah, I've seen Santa.
michael_scott Okay.
darryl_philbin Who cares?
michael_scott Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
dwight_schrute Michael, I would like to be the elf.
michael_scott That makes sense because he has elfish features.
dwight_schrute Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
toby_flenderson I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.
oscar_martinez I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.
kevin_malone I got myself for Secret Santa. I was supposed to tell somebody, but I didn't .
michael_scott You get something good this year?
jim_halpert I think I did a pretty good job.
michael_scott Yeah? Who did you have?
jim_halpert Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.
michael_scott I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
jim_halpert Yeah?
michael_scott I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
jim_halpert Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
michael_scott Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
jim_halpert That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..
michael_scott It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
dwight_schrute Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
stanley_hudson I know how to plug something in.
dwight_schrute I want to do it.
michael_scott All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
all@ Three, two, one.
michael_scott Not great.
phyllis_vance I'm sorry, everybody.
pam_beesly I think the tree looks nice.
dwight_schrute Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
michael_scott No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.
michael_scott Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."
dwight_schrute First present, Oscar.
oscar_martinez Shower radio. Neat.
kelly_kapoor Oh, good, that was from me.
oscar_martinez Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
dwight_schrute Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
jim_halpert Oh, cool.
creed_bratton That's from me.
jim_halpert Great. Where did you get it?
creed_bratton I don't know. It was so long ago.
jim_halpert He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in a bag.
creed_bratton Yep. That's exactly what happened.
dwight_schrute Pam.
pam_beesly Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
jim_halpert There's a little more to it.
dwight_schrute All right, next. Ryan.
michael_scott No, don't!
ryan_howard Whoa, a video iPod.
michael_scott Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
ryan_howard Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.
michael_scott You don't know that.
ryan_howard Yeah, you left the price tag on.
michael_scott I did?
ryan_howard Yeah.
michael_scott What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
dwight_schrute Michael.
michael_scott Oh hey, for me. What is in here? Oh, come on.
phyllis_vance I knitted it for you.
michael_scott An oven mitt? Okay.
michael_scott So Phyllis is basically saying, "Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth." I gave Ryan an iPod.
kevin_malone Should we just keep opening up the presents?
dwight_schrute We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
michael_scott I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
jim_halpert What is Yankee Swap?
michael_scott One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
jim_halpert I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
pam_beesly Yeah, we call it White Elephant.
michael_scott Well, I call it fun!
oscar_martinez Why are we doing this?
michael_scott Because it's better. Because it's more special.
angela_martin It sounds mean.
michael_scott Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.
angela_martin Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere.
michael_scott Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.
meredith_palmer I'll take the teapot.
jim_halpert Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
michael_scott Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
pam_beesly I'll take the iPod.
ryan_howard And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
dwight_schrute Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
stanley_hudson That was meant for Kelly.
ryan_howard Yeah, I figured.
michael_scott I think this is going great.
kelly_kapoor Yikes.
toby_flenderson Well, it's for Angela, so ..
kelly_kapoor That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
dwight_schrute Angela, you're up.
angela_martin I'll take the poster. Some people like these.
kelly_kapoor I will steal the iPod.
michael_scott Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.
michael_scott Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.
oscar_martinez I'll take the ... teapot.
meredith_palmer Damn it.
dwight_schrute Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
meredith_palmer I really want the iPod.
dwight_schrute It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
michael_scott I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
meredith_palmer I'll take the oven mitt.
michael_scott Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
michael_scott Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.
michael_scott "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."
dwight_schrute You and me, Michael. Yes!
michael_scott Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
dwight_schrute I never said it was better than an iPod.
dwight_schrute Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
dwight_schrute Take that, Saddam!
michael_scott Last gift. Kevin.
kevin_malone I want the foot bath.
kevin_malone That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
dwight_schrute Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
pam_beesly I want the iPod.
kelly_kapoor Damn it.
jim_halpert Sure you don't want the teapot?
pam_beesly Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..
jim_halpert Right.
pam_beesly Sorry, I ..
jim_halpert No. No. Definitely. It's ..
kelly_kapoor Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
dwight_schrute Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
jim_halpert Got to be kidding me.
dwight_schrute Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
michael_scott What is she so upset about?
pam_beesly Maybe because you hated her present so much.
michael_scott Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
jim_halpert Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
stanley_hudson And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.
michael_scott Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
oscar_martinez You got a bonus check?
pam_beesly How much?
michael_scott It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.
stanley_hudson All right, I'm done now.
michael_scott Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.
Liquor#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode10 Store Clerk It comes to $166.41.
michael_scott All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
Liquor#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode10 Store Clerk Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.
michael_scott Cool, cool. Box it up.
jim_halpert I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
dwight_schrute No trades.
jim_halpert Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
dwight_schrute "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane. Titanic.
jim_halpert Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
dwight_schrute No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
jim_halpert You don't even drink tea.
dwight_schrute True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
jim_halpert Okay ..
dwight_schrute .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so.
jim_halpert To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.
roy_anderson This is awesome.
pam_beesly I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.
roy_anderson Yeah, I was gonna get you one of these for Christmas, and now I don't have to. I'm gonna save a ton of money.
pam_beesly So what are you going to get me instead?
roy_anderson I don't know. Probably like, a sweater or something.
michael_scott Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.
angela_martin What is that?
michael_scott This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
meredith_palmer We can drink?
toby_flenderson We're really not supposed to serve alcohol.
michael_scott Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
meredith_palmer Me. Please.
michael_scott Go, here we go!
meredith_palmer The deal is that this is my last hurrah, cause I made a New Year's resolution that I'm not going to drink anymore. During the week.
phyllis_vance Hi guys.
ryan_howard Hey.
phyllis_vance Does everybody know my boyfriend, Bob Vance?
kevin_malone Kevin Malone.
bob_vance Vance Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.
stanley_hudson Stanley Hudson.
bob_vance Vance Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.
ryan_howard Ryan Howard.
bob_vance Vance Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.
ryan_howard What line of work you in, Bob?
roy_anderson I think after I lost Culpepper and T.O it was over, man.
darryl_philbin Oh, yeah, I need McMahon, Deion Branch to have big games or else I'm done.
roy_anderson It's possible. I can't believe you traded Shaun Alexander, man.
darryl_philbin I had to. I needed defense.
roy_anderson Come on! Shaun Alexander? He's the best back in the league.
darryl_philbin It's defense.
roy_anderson Oh, no. That is not worth it.
darryl_philbin It is worth it.
roy_anderson Never.
darryl_philbin Are you kidding? You wait.
michael_scott Anybody making out in here? Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. Okay, how's it going in here?
ryan_howard We're running low on cups. Do you want me to just run out and get some?
angela_martin There should be some ..
michael_scott No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
phyllis_vance Meredith, Michael, Kevin One, two, three.
michael_scott Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
ryan_howard Oh, no.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ryan_howard I really did not do anything.
michael_scott Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
jim_halpert You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.
pam_beesly No, I was just checking out my present.
jim_halpert But ..
pam_beesly I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..
jim_halpert Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.
pam_beesly Oh my god! The yearbook picture!
pam_beesly Yeah, I think I made the right choice.
pam_beesly Oh, my God! It's incredible. Is this the Boggle timer?
jim_halpert I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
dwight_schrute This is so awesome.
michael_scott Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
michael_scott You're welcome.
todd_packer Packer Merry Christmas, asswipe!
michael_scott No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
todd_packer Packer What's up my nerds. Check it out.
michael_scott Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
todd_packer Packer Pacman need a drinky.
michael_scott Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
kevin_malone Yeahhh.
michael_scott Darryl. There you go. You earned it.
darryl_philbin That's okay, Mike.
michael_scott No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
darryl_philbin All right. Thanks, man.
michael_scott Hey, Merry Christmas.
ryan_howard Whose butt is that?
kevin_malone Mine.
ryan_howard Oh, how did I not guess that?
michael_scott Lampshade on head! It's happening!
creed_bratton Oh, no.
kelly_kapoor Hey.
dwight_schrute Oh, hello there. But what are you doing?
kelly_kapoor I don't know.
dwight_schrute You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
kevin_malone Thanks for the party, Michael.
meredith_palmer Yeah.
bob_vance Vance Oh, hey. Listen up. We're going to Poor Richard's. Who's in?
oscar_martinez I'm in.
dwight_schrute Yes.
oscar_martinez Michael? Poor Richard's?
michael_scott Yeah, that sounds good.
michael_scott Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.
michael_scott Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?
meredith_palmer Yep.
michael_scott Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
meredith_palmer Yeah.
michael_scott Okay!
