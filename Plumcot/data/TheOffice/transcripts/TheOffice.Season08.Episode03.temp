dwight . . back orders and you never called them.
oscar Can you believe this?
erin There's a dog in the car.
oscar You can't leave a dog in a parked car. Snowboarder, it figures.
jim Do Snowboarders hate animals?
oscar I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
andy Oscar, it's not that hot out.
darryl A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
andy Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
kelly So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
kevin Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
dwight OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. Come on.
jim Dwight! At least aim it.
dwight There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
andy We're losing cloud cover.
kelly Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
darryl Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
oscar This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window.
jim Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
oscar Come on buddy, get back.
dwight Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey!
jim Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
oscar And one for good measure!
jim So. ah, who's gonna take the dog?
oscar Why would we take the dog?
jim What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
oscar Jim, he's not gonna star-
meredith Whoa!
oscar Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
dwight Nein. Sits. Goot.
jim Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
oscar There we go. That should do it.
jim Yeah, that's pretty good.
dwight Yeah, that'll work.
kelly That'll work.
jim Nice job.
dwight Bye poochie!
kelly Bye.
meredith Bye!
pam What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
jim Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
pam Awesome.
dwight Before taxes.
phyllis That's still a lot of money!
andy The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!. and no one else can focus. This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
darryl Hello?. . Justine! Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?. . Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-. what?. Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won. . Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-. What?. . Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- Whoops.
darryl When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won . playing my birthday.
oscar What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
phyllis Yeah.
meredith We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird s*x thing.
oscar At least.
jim I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
dwight I know what you'd do with all that money. "Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug. "
jim No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
pam And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
jim Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
pam I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo.
ryan SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
pam And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting.
kelly Oh, god.
pam And then my handsome husband.
jim Which ideally would be me. .
pam Would bring me a flavored coffee.
jim Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
pam Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
jim I don't know about Stephen King, I mean.
meredith get a divorce. get a divorce.
kelly I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year. . I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
andy Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
darryl I don't know.
andy What d-? What. what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
darryl No.
andy Are they on their way over?
darryl I haven't hired anyone.
phyllis What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
darryl I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
andy This is kinda time sensitive.
darryl I got it. I'm doin' it.
phyllis Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
andy Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in?
erin As long as you guys don't need me up here.
phyllis No. we don't
dwight I think we'll be fine.
oscar Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
andy Are you volunteering?
oscar Of course. I would. But my hip. . I would kill to be at a hundred percent.
andy Jim! How 'bout you?
jim Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you.
dwight Hey. OK no. No. That. You are so not. oh god. False. Andy, I will volunteer.
andy Great. And Kevin.
kevin Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
pam Oh, thank you.
angela Sure.
pam Wait, wait. What's this?
angela Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
pam It says "Lotto Pool", right on top.
angela Yeah. And I said sorry.
pam Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
darryl When did I get so fat?
andy You look awesome.
darryl I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
andy Where are we in the process?
darryl I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys, hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
andy Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
darryl The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
andy You do have a fantastic basement.
darryl I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
andy Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? . This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. Hey! There ya go. there he is.
andy That is not Darryl. I don't know where darryl is. I suspect probably our darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
jim OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
dwight Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it!
jim Nice. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
kevin Damn!
dwight Yup.
andy Welcome, everybody! My name is andy and this is my other brother Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? OK. Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
darryl You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery? Female
applicant Your old crew won the lottery?
andy Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system? Male applicant 1
 Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit?
darryl Oh yeah.
andy Well-
darryl One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals.
andy Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. maybe grab a coffee. or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy. . You know what? Just have a donut. Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
darryl I don't
andy You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so.
darryl Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
andy Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
darryl OK.
andy We need you, OK?
darryl OK.
andy OK?
darryl Yeah.
andy Alright.
dwight What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband.
erin I didn't feel anything.
andy Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
darryl Why do you wanna work here? Male applicant 1
 I need a job.
darryl That's not a good reason.
andy Good. Keepin' 'em honest.
darryl Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you're still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
andy Are we scaring them straight. . ?
darryl I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
darryl I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
ryan Nice. Right back where I like you. Can you make ten copies of this for me?
pam No.
ryan Why not? What are you doing?
pam Uh, buying lottery tickets online.
ryan Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
pam You came in at 10
 andy Is everyone licensed? Male applicant 2
 Like a driver's license?
andy No. Warehouse license. . Masters in warehouse sciences?. I, I feel like darryl has talked about a license of some kind. Female
applicant Is this a joke?
andy No. Not joking. This is real. . painfully real, what is happening right now.
kevin OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
jim There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
dwight Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
jim Yeah Not that they're not smart people.
dwight No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
jim I'd go with that.
dwight Like baboons or elephants.
jim Not that, don't.
kevin Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
jim It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
kevin Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
dwight Kevin! Doesn't apply.
kevin Right. My mom-
erin You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it!
andy Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um. Male applicant 1
 How much longer is this gonna take?
darryl Did you hire 'em?
andy No. Because they all left.
darryl What do you mean "they left"?
andy I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help.
darryl Then I think you should fire me.
andy What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
darryl Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
andy . . OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
darryl No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
andy So darryl says to me "fire me". But what he really means is "I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means. " So I say "No, you're not fired. " But what I really mean is "I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better. ". . . I really hope that's what he and I mean.
andy Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
oscar Bulk or definition?
andy Definition.
oscar bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
andy Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
oscar Oh, he's plenty strong.
oscar It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
pam So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings. .
jim Our fake winnings
pam And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
jim It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
pam Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
jim Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.
dwight Hey, idiot. What did erin want again?
jim A. hot chocolate tea
andy Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
gideon North America. and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That's the headline version.
andy Great. . Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
gideon FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule.
andy Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.
nate Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.
andy Got it. Dually noted. You! Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
bruce Made it.
andy So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
dwight Message in a Bottle, The Postman.
jim kevin Costner.
dwight kevin Costner.
jim Yeah.
kevin So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
erin You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
jim So, it's not the dumbest idea.
dwight It's not the greatest one either.
jim But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
dwight And it's clear we're not going to carry them.
jim So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
dwight Exactly.
kevin I think we're ready to give thi- Jim?
jim Is he OK?
dwight Yep. He'll be fine.
andy Surprise! Your new crew.
darryl Would you just fire me, man?
andy Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
darryl You wanna make me happy? Huh?
andy Yeah.
darryl Give me your job.
andy Haha, what?
darryl I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
andy I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
nate Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises.
andy Nate! Please. . thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
darryl He died.
andy He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
nate What wa-, what was the last. I'm havin' a-
andy None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
darryl I didn't have time because of my daughter.
andy Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
darryl Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
andy Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.
darryl OK.
andy OK what?
darryl OK, don't fire me.
andy Ah, OK.
darryl My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
darryl I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
andy Yeah. That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
kevin Here.
andy What is goin' on?!
kevin Oh hey guys.
darryl Why is the forklift in the wall?
andy Why is the truck empty?
dwight Uh, it's not totally empty.
darryl Is that grease on my floor?
dwight OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
darryl And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
kevin OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
jim OK, alright, that's. look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
darryl And?
erin And we did.
dwight I don't know.
erin Jim? Tell them what it's called.
jim That's alright.
kevin No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
jim Doesn't matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that's stupid.
kevin Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
jim That's OK, we're good.
erin Jim.
andy No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Señor Loadenstein.
jim Porque es muy rapido.
dwight OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
darryl Let me see it.
dwight It's uh, it's in beta testing.
darryl Let me see it!
dwight Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping. Dwight, Erin, jim &amp;
kevin Uno! Dos! Tres!
phyllis Yeah, I lost my client.
creed I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
toby I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. Flenderson files.
pam We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
jim Right. It's city and country combined.
pam Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
jim And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
pam Just like now.
jim Just like now. . too bad the schools are terrible.
pam Oh.
jim But what are you gonna do about that?
pam What are you gonna do?
