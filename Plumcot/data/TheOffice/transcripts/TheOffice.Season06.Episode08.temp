michael Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
kids YAY!
michael Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha. . ha ha ha.
jim We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
michael I am going to scare these kids so bad.
darryl This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
angela Black widow.
kelly Lulu from The Fifth Element.
darryl Nobody told me what people were, alright? So. label yourselves or take what you get.
creed I want to sell your blood!
ryan That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
darryl Here is an old man and a goth dude. and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
meredith I'm a hobo.
darryl I asked for a list. . and a clown.
dwight I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
darryl You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
jim Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
darryl Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
kids Yeah!
michael Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
michael Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
michael It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
darryl What the hell is wrong with you?
michael Who wants candy?
michael . and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
jim Wow.
michael Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
jim I bet we would.
michael They have a TCBY booth.
jim Cool.
michael The same stuff you get downtown.
jim Mmm-hmm.
michael Do you like TCBY?
jim Who doesn't?
michael I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh. it'll be fun
erin I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
jim Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
erin They said the both of you.
jim That is a mistake.
michael You should give them a call. Check that out.
jim Alright. Let's clear this up. Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
michael Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh. why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
jim Great. See ya' then.
michael Wha- what?
jim They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
michael Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
jim I absolutely don't understand, either.
michael I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
jim Alright.
michael Let me get your stroller.
jim Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
michael What are you gonna call him?
jim Dave.
michael No. What is his name?
jim Dave.
michael Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
jim Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
michael Yeah, well. this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
jim Yes, it is.
michael . and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
jim No thanks.
michael They are into style.
jim Mmm-hmm.
michael They are into appearance. We are selling success.
jim . and paper.
michael That's sorta secondary.
jim Nope. No.
jim He's trying to micro-co-manage me. or co-micro. manage. me.
pam Here we are outside-
andy WB!
pam - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.
andy Industrial P. ! Makin' cold calls.
pam The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
andy Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
pam Here it is. Suite 401.
andy Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
pam I know. Now you don't have to.
andy Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. Suite 401.
michael Alright. Hi. Any messages?
erin You're soaking wet.
michael Uh, well, jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
phyllis Wow. Sounds scary.
michael It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
angela Why isn't jim wet?
jim I outran it.
meredith I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
michael It rained.
dwight Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
michael Nothing. Cocoa.
jim I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
michael Good. Yep.
secretary Must be nice to have company on these cold calls.
andy We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.
secretary How exciting! Do you guys know the s*x yet?
pam Oh. No, no. We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
andy Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
erin Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
michael Ok. Thank you.
stanley Did you say 'Koi pond'?
michael Yeah?
erin Michael, people are asking questions.
michael Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
phyllis Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
michael Uh. I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
oscar Jim, did michael fall into a Koi pond?
jim Mmm. it's like michael said. It was some- something else.
michael It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
angela So you fell in?
michael No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
angela So a child had fallen in?
michael Not yet!
kevin That is hilarious.
michael No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.
jim Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was. how long it took him to get out.
pam And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
customer Well that sounds like a really nice deal.
andy Sha-bow.
customer And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too.
andy Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
customer My mistake. Sorry.
pam It's ok.
andy Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh. a nine.
customer That- that's good for you.
pam Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
andy Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what pam looks like.
pam Yeah.
pam You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
andy No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
pam You blew the sale, you idiot.
andy Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
michael Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
erin Staples? Uh, David Wallace called.
michael Oh. He did? What did he say?
erin He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was kevin and meredith put me up to it.
michael Ok.
kevin I'm gonna kill you.
stanley Michael, don't listen to them.
michael Thank you, Stanley.
stanley You just ignore their carp.
michael Ok.
dwight Michael?
michael Yes.
dwight A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
creed Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?
michael I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
oscar Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
phyllis And when you fell in, did you flounder?
dwight Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
michael I know what a flounder is. . push;
michael I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look. Damn it! He'd still look good.
michael The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
phyllis Michael, you make fun of us every day.
michael Uh.
kevin Yeah. Every single day.
michael You never said anything.
meredith Uh, we have. Countless times.
michael Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'
angela That's never the case.
michael We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
dwight I don't want people making fun of my nose.
michael Your nose?
dwight It's too small.
michael Alright.
oscar Oh my. That is small.
dwight Just, write it down, please.
oscar Can you breathe okay?
kelly What keeps your glasses on?
dwight Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
michael No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
kevin I don't want people making fun of my weight.
michael Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? Meredith?
meredith I don't want to say it out loud.
michael Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
meredith I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so. what are you gonna do?
michael Ok.
andy That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it. Keena
gifford Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple.
andy Well-
pam Oh- Thank you. Keena
gifford Some couples don't seem like a good match. You two do.
pam Well, you know.
andy Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
pam He loves to eat.
andy I love to dance-
pam I love to watch him dance.
andy Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
pam And I'll just watch him. Keena
gifford And a baby on the way? You must be so excited.
pam Yes.
andy Yeah. We are thrilled.
pam Mmm-hmm.
andy In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
pam It was, sweetie. Keena
gifford Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet.
andy Yeah. On Clearview Avenue. Keena
gifford Yeah!
andy Yeah.
angela This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
phyllis So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
erin Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died.
michael It's a fish.
erin They want you to pay for it.
michael It could've died of natural causes. So.
erin Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
oscar When is the funeral?
michael Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
erin $300.
michael What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
creed Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
jim Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
michael No, no.
dwight Thank you.
michael No. We are not done here. This-
andy One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick! Keena
gifford That's great!
andy Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
pam Yeah, well, that'll happen.
andy Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too.
pam Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
andy Message received, little soy bean.
jim I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
michael No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
jim No, they don't.
michael Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
jim Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
michael I want to make fun of you right now.
jim Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
michael No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
jim See?
michael Oh, my God.
michael Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
phyllis Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
michael Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
dwight Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
michael It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh. it was freezing. No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh. ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
kevin Enjoying your nut?
oscar Kevin.
angela Why?
kevin I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
angela I was.
michael Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
jim Mm. I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so.
kevin We'll stay late.
andy Well, that went pretty well.
pam Yeah, I guess.
andy We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.
pam If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
andy You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
pam Yeah. Way too much.
andy Yeah.
pam I mean, what the hell was that?
andy What the heck was that?
pam When you cried?
andy Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
pam You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
andy No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?
pam Hmm.
andy I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
pam Well, are you dating anyone?
andy What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
pam Ah.
andy You think I can do better?
pam Ah.
andy Gotta get my goin' out on.
meredith Hey, let's watch this thing.
jim Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
oscar How can we not watch this?
jim What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
phyllis We're not mocking, we're watching.
jim That will inevitably lead to mocking. So.
phyllis Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
michael Is this the tape of me falling?
phyllis Yes. Put the DVD in.
kevin Open QuickTime.
oscar It starts on it's own. Let it -
kevin No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
jim Guys. michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
michael No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
jim What are you doing?
michael It's alright. I can handle it.
jim No.
michael I am a grown-up, Jim.
meredith Shh. It's on.
kevin Here they come. Boom!
oscar Oh. Did - did you see that?
jim See what?
angela Why'd you stop it?
jim Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
oscar Jim, you let michael fall in.
dwight Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
jim Oh. man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
michael I don't think you froze.
jim It's a killer new dance move. Do you wanna talk in your office?
angela No.
jim I didn't ask you. Would you like to talk?
dwight Judas.
dwight jim is my enemy. But it turns out that jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, jim is actually my friend. But. because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually jim is my enemy. But-
jim I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
michael jim is jealous of me? jim is jealous of me.
meredith Hey, what's up lifeguard?
oscar Jim, I think I'm in your way.
michael Oscar's a douche.
jim He's alright.
michael No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok.
jim Thanks Michael.
michael You're welcome. Whoa! Almost fell.
pam Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
erin Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
pam Ok.
erin Thanks.
pam Mmm-hmm.
erin How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
pam No. It was a total waste of time. Um. it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with andy Bernard. He's really cool.
erin Yeah, he is!
pam Yeah, he is.
erin He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
pam That's. right. He's like Marlon Brando.
erin Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
pam I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
