ryan_howard Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore. I got Jim's uh, old job. Which means at my 10 year high school reunion it will not say "Ryan Howard is a temp." It will say "Ryan Howard is a junior sales associate at a mid-range paper supply firm. ...that'll show 'em.
jim_halpert You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.
pam_beesly Me too. ...I think we're just drunk.
jim_halpert No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk?
pam_beesly No... Jim---
jim_halpert Are you really gonna marry him? ...Ok.
dwight_schrute Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! False. I do not miss him.
michael_scott No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody "faggie". Why would anybody find that offensive?
toby_flenderson OK I think Oscar would just like if you used "lame" or something like that.
michael_scott That's what faggie means!
toby_flenderson No not really...
toby_flenderson Apparently you called Oscar "faggie" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.
michael_scott It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
toby_flenderson All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay.
michael_scott Exactly!
toby_flenderson I mean for real.
michael_scott Yeah, I know.
toby_flenderson No, I mean he's attracted to other men.
michael_scott OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
toby_flenderson OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.
michael_scott I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people "retards". It's bad taste. You call your friends "retards" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend.
michael_scott Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea.
oscar_martinez No, it's fine.
michael_scott No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
oscar_martinez That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.
angela_martin It explains so much.
oscar_martinez No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if... Uh... yeah I'm gay.
jim_halpert I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.
jim_halpert Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view... right?
andy_bernard Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right?
jim_halpert Uh-huh, yeah. I am.
andy_bernard She's pretty hot huh? She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters.
jim_halpert OooOK.
andy_bernard OooOK.
jim_halpert I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.
andy_bernard Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it? I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, "Here Comes Treble."
josh_porter So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.
jim_halpert Oh, I can do that.
karen_filippelli Jim's nice enough. I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this. What is that?
michael_scott Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
dwight_schrute Of course.
michael_scott What about Oscar?
dwight_schrute Absolutely not.
michael_scott Well, he is.
dwight_schrute Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
michael_scott There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.
dwight_schrute You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
michael_scott Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
michael_scott Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.
dwight_schrute I really don't think so.
michael_scott I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
dwight_schrute
michael_scott Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
dwight_schrute Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
michael_scott That's ridiculous.
dwight_schrute Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.
michael_scott Let's call him and get the website.
dwight_schrute Definitely.
jim_halpert What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem. It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer.
michael_scott Well, they're sold out.
dwight_schrute Damn. I'll try Brookstone.
jim_halpert I miss that.
roy_anderson Chicken or fish?
pam_beesly Chicken.
roy_anderson So you havin' a good day?
pam_beesly Excellent, thanks.
roy_anderson Good, glad. OK.
pam_beesly Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks.
roy_anderson After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back.
stanley_hudson I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters.
kelly_kapoor That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you.
oscar_martinez Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.
angela_martin Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented.
andy_bernard OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!
jan_levinson You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.
michael_scott I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so...
jan_levinson That's not what it's called.
toby_flenderson OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?
michael_scott What? What does that even...
jan_levinson Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.
michael_scott Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival.
toby_flenderson All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.
michael_scott I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?
jan_levinson NO!
michael_scott I don't kn--
jan_levinson No, it's not possible.
michael_scott Anything's possible.
jan_levinson You know, imagine... you were gay.
michael_scott Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
jan_levinson Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand?
michael_scott The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.
oscar_martinez Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
michael_scott Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?
pam_beesly Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
dwight_schrute Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.
michael_scott Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful.
dwight_schrute Ah damn pop-ups.
oscar_martinez What are you doing?!
angela_martin Watching some of your friends.
michael_scott All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!
michael_scott Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.
michael_scott We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you.
oscar_martinez Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now?
creed_bratton I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.
michael_scott Who should be the judges and juries of our society?
angela_martin Judges and juries!
michael_scott Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?
kevin_malone That sounds great.
dwight_schrute I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
oscar_martinez No one else in this office is gay.
dwight_schrute What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
phyllis_vance I'm getting married to Bob Vance.
michael_scott That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing! See? Everybody has a chance!
michael_scott But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!
phyllis_vance No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.
michael_scott Right! And I take that as a compliment.
phyllis_vance Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---
michael_scott Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
oscar_martinez You sound pretty defensive Michael.
michael_scott No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!
oscar_martinez I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here.
michael_scott No no no. The only signal that I am sending is Gay, good.
michael_scott Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.
oscar_martinez I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.
michael_scott You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---
oscar_martinez I would rather not.
michael_scott ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!
oscar_martinez No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!
michael_scott All right, um... sorry.
oscar_martinez Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on.
michael_scott I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.
dwight_schrute Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.
michael_scott You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this. I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here.
michael_scott Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!
michael_scott We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?
michael_scott I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said.
michael_scott Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?
oscar_martinez I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
dwight_schrute "Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice!
oscar_martinez What are you doing?!
dwight_schrute Shhh. Don't be scared. It works. ...oh no.
