oscar_martinez Oh, for God's sake.
oscar_martinez Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That's it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
erin_hannon Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don't. And I don't. But I am so excited to be a part of it.
andy_bernard After you my good sir.
dwight_schrute No, I insist.
andy_bernard I insist.
jim_halpert The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California... for the manager position. Who took one look around and left. He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill. And he chose...
andy_bernard I... it's unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice's first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, "I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer." Smart, right?
kelly_kapoor (planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
andy_bernard Uh, this has got to stop.
kelly_kapoor I can't get down.
dwight_schrute K... Kevin!
dwight_schrute Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great.
dwight_schrute K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?
pam_beesly I don't think I should.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
pam_beesly Right here. Little Michael Scott-
jim_halpert No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
pam_beesly Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
angela_martin Look, it's a ‘Little Pregs' and ‘Big Pregs'
pam_beesly Wait, when did we start calling it that-
angela_martin Isn't it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
pam_beesly Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
angela_martin I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
dwight_schrute Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl.
darryl_philbin I'm lifting.
darryl_philbin Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin' much better. This soda. This is mine.
stanley_hudson It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
stanley_hudson I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I'm telling someone how to do somethin'. I go on with a long description and then I say, "and shove it up your butt." It's stupid, but it's my thing now.
jim_halpert No one should be planking at all.
andy_bernard Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
dwight_schrute Say no more.
dwight_schrute Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. ‘Specially with me around.
jim_halpert You watching that commercial again? Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?
pam_beesly Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
jim_halpert He's got a bank vault. That's a start.
pam_beesly Not enough though.
jim_halpert The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange.
erin_hannon Here we go.
robert_california Hello.
erin_hannon Robert California. Let's have a conversation.
robert_california Describe your day so far.
erin_hannon Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
robert_california And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It's a waste of your time. That's how every day's begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.
erin_hannon Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I've been doing this thing-
andy_bernard Hey, Robert. We have that 9 30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
andy_bernard First item on the agenda can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don't know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
erin_hannon Pam, pam. Psst. Pam.
pam_beesly Jim.
jim_halpert Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. Okay. What is this?
andy_bernard The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
robert_california What are your thoughts.
andy_bernard Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?
dwight_schrute What are you looking at?
jim_halpert It's, it's nothing.
dwight_schrute It can't be nothing.
phyllis_vance Yeah, it can't be nothing.
jim_halpert It's just a list of our names, split into two columns.
stanley_hudson What?
jim_halpert Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
erin_hannon No.
jim_halpert No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
dwight_schrute Nice catch.
pam_beesly If he comes out, distract him.
kevin_malone We need a warning signal.
jim_halpert We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
kevin_malone We do.
jim_halpert I promise you, we don't need a warning-
kevin_malone WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
phyllis_vance Ahhh!
dwight_schrute Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
phyllis_vance Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
dwight_schrute ... 2, 3!
phyllis_vance Thanks guys.
dwight_schrute Okay, which side of the list am I on?
jim_halpert Left.
dwight_schrute Yes!
jim_halpert Why are you- How do you know?
andy_bernard Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
jim_halpert Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert's notebook.
pam_beesly He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
andy_bernard Oh, okay. I don't want any part of this.
pam_beesly Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna fire.
jim_halpert Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
dwight_schrute This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an ‘Alive' situation. No... that can't be it.
andy_bernard I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
jim_halpert I don't think it's-
pam_beesly ‘Scuse me?
dwight_schrute Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider.
angela_martin Did you guys figure it out?
andy_bernard We couldn't crack it.
stanley_hudson Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
andy_bernard He'll know that we looked at his private notebook.
phyllis_vance C'mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
andy_bernard I'm already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it's starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
phyllis_vance Yeah, that's all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
robert_california Yes, for god's sake Andy. Yes, come in.
andy_bernard What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
robert_california Great. Thank you.
andy_bernard And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
robert_california What is this?
andy_bernard It's a photocopy from your notebook.
robert_california You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.
andy_bernard No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
robert_california Ah, please. Here's what it is. It's a doodle.
andy_bernard What?
robert_california Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don't you think? Well, I doodle too, but I'm not an artist. So I draw words and lists.
andy_bernard That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
robert_california Might as well have been sketching a cube.
andy_bernard Okay. Robert's in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
meredith_palmer Maybe we're s'posed to do it with people in our group.
jim_halpert That's not it.
meredith_palmer People in the other group.
jim_halpert Mmum, still wrong.
andy_bernard Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
stanley_hudson Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ‘em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
andy_bernard Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
kevin_malone I know! It's alphabetical.
all@ No.
dwight_schrute No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list... ATTACK!
jim_halpert Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!
andy_bernard Dwight!
meredith_palmer Hey!
kevin_malone Warning! Warning! Warning!
robert_california I'd like to invite the following people to join me for lunch Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.
dwight_schrute That's great. Let's do this guys.
jim_halpert Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
pam_beesly I love you so much.
jim_halpert Hey. It's nothing. Alright? I'll text you when we get there. Let you know what's going on.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Nope. No dog video.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Okay. See you guys.
andy_bernard Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
robert_california Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?
jim_halpert Uhhh, the street?
robert_california Sesame street.
jim_halpert Oh, I didn't know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
robert_california Elmo, god's sake, it's the Elmo era.
jim_halpert Right.
robert_california Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn't you agree.
jim_halpert Yeah, she does like Elmo.
oscar_martinez Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
phyllis_vance Completely.
darryl_philbin Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
kevin_malone The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
toby_flenderson I should not be here. I'm in the- I was in the wrong- I'm- I'm sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
andy_bernard Great group! Pizza party!
kelly_kapoor How is this a pizza party?
andy_bernard Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, well, that's just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
andy_bernard Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
stanley_hudson What's that?
andy_bernard Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
stanley_hudson That's pizza.
pam_beesly That's regular pizza.
dwight_schrute You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
robert_california I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
dwight_schrute Okay!
all@ Awww.
phyllis_vance Well, what about the other guys.
dwight_schrute Losers.
robert_california No.
dwight_schrute C'mon.
robert_california I don't- I don't wanna say-
dwight_schrute C'mon, c'mon.
robert_california No, no.
dwight_schrute C'mon.
robert_california Ha, I guess I think they're losers.
dwight_schrute Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
robert_california Probably shouldn't have said that.
andy_bernard Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
pam_beesly Oh, text from Jim. "This is getting very weird. Will explain later."
pam_beesly Oh, text from Kevin.
meredith_palmer "Suck it losers."
ryan_howard Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn't the fact that I'm in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
pam_beesly I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, "Who's that receptionist? I like her." Now I'm just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you're like, "Oh, loser."
andy_bernard C'mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
pam_beesly Oh. Oh God.
kelly_kapoor Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
angela_martin It was excellent.
darryl_philbin Good times.
andy_bernard Yeah?
dwight_schrute Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
kevin_malone I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
jim_halpert Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
pam_beesly Yeah, I'm fine.
kevin_malone Loser. Losers.
meredith_palmer Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It'll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
andy_bernard When I was a salesman I could just be like "Not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob." Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
andy_bernard Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
robert_california I never said that.
andy_bernard Thank you. Great. Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you're talking about?
andy_bernard Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?
robert_california Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I'll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you're a winner. If I didn't, I don't. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.
phyllis_vance Whew, well. I guess that's that.
andy_bernard No. No, no.
erin_hannon Andy, don't go in there!
andy_bernard I'm going in there.
andy_bernard I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
robert_california I'm not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don't use ballpoint pens.
andy_bernard Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
robert_california I did not know about the sales figures.
andy_bernard Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word "no" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
dwight_schrute Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
jim_halpert Shhh.
andy_bernard Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
erin_hannon I like my new group. I liked my old group.
robert_california Are we done?
andy_bernard Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we're gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
robert_california You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?
andy_bernard Yes, I do.
robert_california And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.
andy_bernard I don't care.
andy_bernard Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
stanley_hudson We get that every year.
andy_bernard Well, you got it this year too.
phyllis_vance Good night, Andy.
andy_bernard Night.
angela_martin Bye.
oscar_martinez Good night Andy.
dwight_schrute Good night.
andy_bernard Night.
jim_halpert Alright, I'm gonna go warm up the car.
pam_beesly Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
pam_beesly Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but- I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No. It's wonderful. I'm gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
