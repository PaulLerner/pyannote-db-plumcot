dwight_schrute Could you please sign my expense report?
michael_scott No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
dwight_schrute Sign this.
jim_halpert Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals.
dwight_schrute Sign it.
jim_halpert No, not without a "please."
dwight_schrute Idiot.
dwight_schrute I have a complaint about Jim.
michael_scott That is not big picture.
dwight_schrute I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
michael_scott ... Okay.
dwight_schrute Jim won't sign my expense report.
michael_scott That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
dwight_schrute No, that is huge.
michael_scott You're trying to trick me.
dwight_schrute This has to do--
michael_scott Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
dwight_schrute I'd like to lodge a complaint.
jim_halpert I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
dwight_schrute You!
jim_halpert Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
dwight_schrute One minute ago.
jim_halpert Okay. And how do you feel?
dwight_schrute Angry.
jim_halpert All right. Did he hit you?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert Did you cry?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert Did you feel like crying?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert I'm just gonna write "held back tears."
dwight_schrute Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
jim_halpert If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
dwight_schrute I'm not cr-- uhh!
dwight_schrute I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
erin_hannon Dwight, Jim wants you to keep it down.
michael_scott Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
jim_halpert Michael...
michael_scott Yes?
jim_halpert Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
michael_scott Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
stanley_hudson Can I also be a boss?
oscar_martinez Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
jim_halpert I have noticed that we--
michael_scott Welcome.
jim_halpert Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
michael_scott Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
michael_scott Disruptive.
jim_halpert Yes.
michael_scott No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
jim_halpert Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
michael_scott Let's do.
jim_halpert Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
michael_scott N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
jim_halpert I am.
michael_scott Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...
jim_halpert Right.
michael_scott At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
jim_halpert Yes, I agree.
michael_scott Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.
jim_halpert I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
michael_scott You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
jim_halpert You mean on a weekend?
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
michael_scott Alright. No more meetings this week.
jim_halpert Really? You just agreed to that?
michael_scott I can be very suprising.
phyllis_vance What's going on?
pam_beesly I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
ryan_howard You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
phyllis_vance Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
pam_beesly We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.
pam_beesly It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
phyllis_vance Perfect. I hate registries.
pam_beesly Oh, good.
phyllis_vance My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
pam_beesly No, we're not.
phyllis_vance Good. Good.
michael_scott Mm-hmm?
jim_halpert Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
michael_scott Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
jim_halpert Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
michael_scott Stanley, you don't need to answer that.
jim_halpert Stanley?
stanley_hudson "If you don't smell this, you're fired."
jim_halpert Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
michael_scott What do you mean by "these people"?
jim_halpert Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
michael_scott Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
jim_halpert That's not what I meant.
michael_scott Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
jim_halpert I disagree.
michael_scott What do you guys think?
jim_halpert Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
michael_scott No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
jim_halpert That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
michael_scott That is not what Wallace told us.
jim_halpert That's exactly what Wallace told us.
michael_scott That is not the way I heard it.
kelly_kapoor I love rivalries-- Michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L.C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
michael_scott It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
jim_halpert I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
michael_scott No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. I will call David Wallace.
erin_hannon David Wallace is on line two for you guys.
michael_scott Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--
jim_halpert Hey, David. You got Jim here.
michael_scott Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
david_wallace Wallace Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
michael_scott Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
jim_halpert Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.
david_wallace Wallace It's probably a little of both.
michael_scott Which is it more of?
david_wallace Wallace Excuse me?
jim_halpert David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.
david_wallace Wallace Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
michael_scott I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
david_wallace Wallace Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
jim_halpert Nope, not at all.
michael_scott No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
david_wallace Wallace Very good.
jim_halpert Alright, thanks alot, David.
michael_scott Talk to you later-- Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. Alright, I am looking forward to this.
jim_halpert You don't have to lie.
michael_scott I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.
jim_halpert Right.
michael_scott All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
jim_halpert Alright. Let's get started.
creed_bratton Hey, why haven't we ever, um...
meredith_palmer We have.
michael_scott You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.
jim_halpert Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
michael_scott No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.
jim_halpert Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
michael_scott Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
jim_halpert It's hard to tell so far.
michael_scott You use your brain too much.
jim_halpert I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
michael_scott Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
jim_halpert You just came up with that.
michael_scott As I was saying it.
jim_halpert Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
michael_scott Con-- you look like a nerd.
jim_halpert Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
michael_scott Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
jim_halpert Pro-- no favoritism.
michael_scott Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.
jim_halpert I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
kevin_malone Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
pam_beesly I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
kevin_malone Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
kevin_malone Will you take a check?
pam_beesly Yeah.
kevin_malone Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, "To love's eternal glory."
pam_beesly Okay.
kevin_malone Wait til' Monday.
pam_beesly Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. oh look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!" That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
jim_halpert You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
michael_scott That will not go over well.
jim_halpert I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...
michael_scott Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.
jim_halpert I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
michael_scott No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
jim_halpert Michael.
michael_scott And then another--
jim_halpert Look, you have a lot of strengths.
michael_scott Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
jim_halpert I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
michael_scott Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
jim_halpert But there is a reason why I'm here!
michael_scott Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
jim_halpert No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
michael_scott Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?
jim_halpert I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
michael_scott Ah.
jim_halpert At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
michael_scott Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
jim_halpert But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
michael_scott Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it.
jim_halpert
michael_scott This had better be terrible.
jim_halpert Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
meredith_palmer Wait. Seriously?!
jim_halpert Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
oscar_martinez Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
angela_martin But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
oscar_martinez Excellent question, genius. It's because Jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
jim_halpert Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.
oscar_martinez Well?
jim_halpert Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
kelly_kapoor What's going on?
kevin_malone Jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
kelly_kapoor What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
oscar_martinez Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that Jim thinks you're smart?
kelly_kapoor No! How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
dwight_schrute This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
jim_halpert Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
dwight_schrute What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
oscar_martinez Exactly!
kevin_malone Totally!
oscar_martinez We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
creed_bratton Yes.
angela_martin Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
meredith_palmer My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
kevin_malone Yeah.
dwight_schrute Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
meredith_palmer What the hell?!
jim_halpert Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so...
michael_scott That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
angela_martin What are you talking about Michael?
stanley_hudson We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
michael_scott My plan-- a man-- panama.
andy_bernard That's not how that goes.
meredith_palmer You're not saying anything. At least Jim was being direct...
jim_halpert Thank you, Meredith.
meredith_palmer ...when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
oscar_martinez We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
michael_scott Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
oscar_martinez Again, that gives us no information.
phyllis_vance This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
michael_scott What about a raise based on merit?
jim_halpert Rank each person individually?
michael_scott Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
jim_halpert Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started.
michael_scott Are you making a--
jim_halpert Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
oscar_martinez Just--
kevin_malone Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
angela_martin It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
meredith_palmer I am so pissed at this company!
dwight_schrute And Jim!
meredith_palmer Yeah. Who said that?
dwight_schrute I think it was Creed.
creed_bratton Yep.
jim_halpert It's going really well, actually.
jim_halpert Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv-- who's that?
michael_scott Toby.
jim_halpert He's not a part of this. You know that.
michael_scott Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
jim_halpert Okay, your move.
michael_scott Alright! Who to pick? Who to pick?
jim_halpert Here we go.
michael_scott I... will skip a turn.
jim_halpert Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
michael_scott I need more time.
erin_hannon Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.
dwight_schrute People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
dwight_schrute Come on in. That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
oscar_martinez What the hell?!
dwight_schrute Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
michael_scott Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
kevin_malone What does a bean mean?
pam_beesly Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
kevin_malone Michael, what does a bean mean?
pam_beesly Jim?
jim_halpert I was just trying to be unbiased.
kevin_malone What does a bean mean?!
oscar_martinez Someone please explain it to Kevin.
meredith_palmer Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
phyllis_vance Not according to the beans.
angela_martin This is how you make this important decision?
andy_bernard There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. That is ridiculous. This is how it works.
phyllis_vance It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
andy_bernard Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
phyllis_vance Yeah, I would, too.
dwight_schrute Are we idiots? What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
phyllis_vance I say no.
dwight_schrute No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? Okay.
michael_scott
kevin_malone What does a bean mean?
michael_scott How you doing?
jim_halpert Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
michael_scott Oh, what are you usually?
jim_halpert Six. You?
michael_scott Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
jim_halpert I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
michael_scott I know, I know.
jim_halpert We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
michael_scott Yes, we did.
jim_halpert I just-- what?
michael_scott Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.
phyllis_vance Michael!
kevin_malone Michael!
phyllis_vance Come on! This isn't fair!
jim_halpert Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
phyllis_vance Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
jim_halpert Thank you.
michael_scott You're welcome.
jim_halpert What's in here?
michael_scott Gin.
jim_halpert Ooh!
michael_scott Just pretend we're not here.
ryan_howard Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
pam_beesly Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
ryan_howard Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5,000 a year from now?
pam_beesly $100 now for sure.
ryan_howard Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift...
pam_beesly Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
ryan_howard Instead of $5,000 a year from now?
pam_beesly How sure is this?
pam_beesly The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
pam_beesly Don't tell Jim.
