erin Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest!
erin Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
dwight Shut up.
dwight I got her!
pam Not cool, Dwight.
jim Not cool.
michael Oh, no. I still have the lease on the michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
michael Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
dwight I do.
michael Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
pam Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
michael Oh, really? Ok.
pam Just sent it.
michael What about the rest of you?
michael At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
michael Who else? Who else? Ryan?
ryan I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
ryan Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
michael Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
angela No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
phyllis Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
michael What?
phyllis Work.
michael Ugh! God! What happened to you people? We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work. is work.
pam If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
pam Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
michael I. was just learning. to. love.
erin Hi, guys. How you doing?
dwight Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
erin Right. I'm sorry.
dwight Now, how can I help you?
erin Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
dwight Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
pam So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
dwight It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
erin Sure.
jim There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
pam We're getting married today.
jim So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
pam Tell 'em how it happened.
jim Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
pam And very expensive.
jim Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
pam You can't leave anyone out.
jim No one.
pam Ok, just get to the good part.
jim Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you. "
pam I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
erin Michael? michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
michael No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
erin Well, I like to swim.
michael That's good.
erin You have a cool place to come hang.
michael If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so.

erin Whew.
michael I love it.
michael Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone. Charles is gone.
michael Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like Dave died or something.
michael Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
oscar Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.

pam What?
michael Funk is the problem and the solution.
jim That makes sense.
michael I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
oscar Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
michael Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
dwight All work and no play makes michael a dull boy.
meredith This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
michael No. dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
andy It's like a haunted disco.
michael . with coffee but without the haunted.
phyllis It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
michael It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
erin It's a cafe disco.

andy Everybody Dance Now", spins in chair] Oww!
phyllis Aw, what the hell? Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
jessica Oh, he's on a call.
phyllis Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
jessica It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
phyllis Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
jessica I'll let him know.
phyllis Mmm-hmm. . push;

michael I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
dwight What do you think history is?
michael It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
michael Alright. Here we go.
dwight Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
michael You having fun?
erin Oh, my God! What happened?
michael What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
phyllis What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
dwight You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
michael Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
oscar What happened to Phyllis?
michael Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So.
angela Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
michael Ok. phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything.
stanley I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
michael You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
erin Yes.
michael I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
erin Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.

erin You're bad. vance Refrigeration Guy 1
 There's girl in there. vance Refrigeration Guy 2
 Where? VRG 1
 The other room? VRG 2
 What other room? VRG 1

dwight Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
phyllis I do.

andy Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
erin Ashley! You made it!
oscar You invited someone?
erin Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
oscar I've been here 8 years and I've never. Rude.
andy I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
michael Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
creed I hear it, too, Boss.
michael It's better than I imagined it!
phyllis That feels good, Dwight.
dwight Tell me where it hurts.
phylis Right. mmmm. right there.
dwight Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
michael Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am michael Scott.
erin Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
angela Stop!
michael Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?

michael Oh. Alright. There you go.
angela No. You need to sign them all.
michael No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
angela Look, I hate to be "that" person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
michael I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you. " No.
dwight This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
phyllis An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
dwight Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
creed Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
michael Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
creed No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
dwight I'm gonna with the python.
phyllis But the rattler's so scary.
dwight No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
phyllis I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.
dwight What's so funny?
phyllis When I say it out loud it's so silly.
michael Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!

michael Hey! Hey! jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
phyllis Wanna dance, Dwight?
dwight Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic. Bob
vance Mind if I steal my wife?
dwight You can't steal what is legally your property. Bob
vance Are those staples?
andy This dance competition is not over.
