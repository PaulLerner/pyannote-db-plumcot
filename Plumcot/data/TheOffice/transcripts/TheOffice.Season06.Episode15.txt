michael_scott Oh, yeah. I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?
erin_hannon I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?
oscar_martinez I think you don't know what you're saying.
michael_scott It's from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me.
michael_scott Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.
michael_scott Oh! Wow. Awesome. For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Here we go. Oh! Wow.
michael_scott Cool. What next?
erin_hannon Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for Gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
michael_scott Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -
dwight_schrute Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
michael_scott Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
dwight_schrute Terrible mistake.
michael_scott And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
dwight_schrute Undistributable.
pam_beesly Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
dwight_schrute Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
oscar_martinez I think we can do it.
pam_beesly Yep, yep.
oscar_martinez Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
pam_beesly Yep.
oscar_martinez Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
pam_beesly Yes.
creed_bratton Have you tried making everything smaller?
michael_scott And - Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves.
pam_beesly Oh, Michael.
michael_scott Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.
pam_beesly No, don't!
michael_scott Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
michael_scott Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
pam_beesly What do you want us to do?
michael_scott Why do I have to explain everything?
pam_beesly Because we're usually not on the same page.
michael_scott Okay.
gabe_lewis Oh. Okay. And to you.
michael_scott Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
dwight_schrute Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
michael_scott You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
gabe_lewis Um, hi, uh, my name is Gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
michael_scott Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
jim_halpert Co-manager, actually.
michael_scott In training.
jim_halpert Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...
gabe_lewis We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
michael_scott We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
dwight_schrute So excited.
michael_scott We have a little song prepared for you.
gabe_lewis Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website.
michael_scott Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
dwight_schrute Oh. Of course.
michael_scott Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
andy_bernard Ok.
andy_bernard & Erin Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the "Electric City" sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab -
michael_scott Saber.
andy_bernard Saber. Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.
andy_bernard & Erin Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre.
andy_bernard You sure it's saber?
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11 20.
pam_beesly Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
jim_halpert Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
pam_beesly We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
jim_halpert Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
pam_beesly We're hoping our interview seals the deal.
jim_halpert But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
pam_beesly Okay. Okay. Yeah.
the_storyteller Slater So you've just been bought by Sabre. You've probably got a lot of questions. Hi. I'm Christian Slater. What's it like to work for Sabre? Let's find out together. Working at Sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you. Sabre is respecting the past, but opening a window to the future. Have you ever tasted a rainbow? At Sabre, you will.
jo_bennett Bennett You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you.
jim_halpert So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, "What's going on?" Well, you're not alone.
michael_scott Wow. Really terrific.
gabe_lewis Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
michael_scott Perfect.
michael_scott No. Don't like that.
gabe_lewis At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -
meredith_palmer Talk about vacation days!
gabe_lewis We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
oscar_martinez But I banked six weeks.
angela_martin I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
meredith_palmer Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
gabe_lewis Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites. And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
michael_scott Mm, nope. Don't like that.
gabe_lewis Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
michael_scott We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
gabe_lewis Little cups? Like paper or plastic or... ?
michael_scott I don't know what they're made of.
dwight_schrute They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
gabe_lewis Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
michael_scott You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
stanley_hudson That's ok.
michael_scott There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
michael_scott Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
toby_flenderson Oop.
michael_scott What?
toby_flenderson Looks like we kicked it.
michael_scott I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
michael_scott I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.
gabe_lewis Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so...
michael_scott Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.
gabe_lewis Which ones?
michael_scott All of them.
gabe_lewis Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
michael_scott So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
gabe_lewis You know what? Let me see what I can do.
jim_halpert Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
pam_beesly There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
jim_halpert Oh. Adorable, right? I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
pam_beesly Who? The -
jim_halpert I don't know. I don't know.
pam_beesly The guy we're meeting with?
jim_halpert I don't know, I don't know.
andy_bernard I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
erin_hannon Well, I saw them in there.
andy_bernard Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, "Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries."
erin_hannon I think when Andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
andy_bernard The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
gabe_lewis First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so...
jo_bennett Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
gabe_lewis Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have really been proud of the way... Okay, um...
jo_bennett Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? I want to see who it is. Turn me around.
gabe_lewis I don't - it's just...
jo_bennett Turn me around. Now. Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?
michael_scott Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
jo_bennett Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.
michael_scott Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
jo_bennett Aw, thank you. I've been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?
michael_scott Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
jo_bennett Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson's snowball company, so you'll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things.
michael_scott Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.
jo_bennett So listen, why don't you tell Gabe if by the end of the day you can't handle the changes.
michael_scott I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
jo_bennett I would take until the end of the day if I were you.
jerry Pam and Jim? Hey, I'm Jerry.
pam_beesly Hi Jerry.
jim_halpert Jerry.
jerry Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room.
jim_halpert This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
jerry Oh, so you saw it already?
jim_halpert No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
pam_beesly It's lovely.
jerry Oh. Got to take this. Sorry.
jim_halpert Do it.
jerry Okay. Hi, this is Jerry.
pam_beesly Ok, you've got to pull it together.
jim_halpert We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
pam_beesly He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
jim_halpert What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
pam_beesly That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
jerry Sorry about that. Right this way.
jim_halpert All right.
michael_scott I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? Hey. Hi, sorry.
david_wallace Michael.
michael_scott I hope you're not busy doing something.
david_wallace No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
michael_scott You sure?
david_wallace You look great.
michael_scott You look great too.
david_wallace You hungry? I'm just having lunch.
michael_scott Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
david_wallace Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in.
teddy Wallace Huh? Hey.
michael_scott Hey. Wow.
david_wallace Keep it up, son.
michael_scott Really loud.
michael_scott Wow. Oh, yummy. You have got the life, my friend.
david_wallace Yeah.
michael_scott Can I just stay here and never go back?
david_wallace Things not going so well there?
michael_scott Oh, man. How much time do you have?
david_wallace I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
michael_scott Yeah.
rachel_wallace Wallace Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool?
david_wallace Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out.
rachel_wallace Wallace Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn't know if you did anything.
david_wallace No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
michael_scott Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...
rachel_wallace Wallace No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to?
michael_scott I don't know.
david_wallace Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. Outside.
jim_halpert There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
jerry That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans.
jim_halpert Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
jerry Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it.
pam_beesly Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
jim_halpert What?
jerry Seriously? You told her?
jim_halpert Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
jerry And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?
jim_halpert No.
pam_beesly Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
jerry Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?
pam_beesly Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
jerry I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?
jim_halpert Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
jerry It doesn't lock for the children's safety.
jim_halpert Anybody could have walked in.
jerry It was story time.
michael_scott Sabre is changing everything. Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?
david_wallace I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
michael_scott Exactly. What are you thinking?
david_wallace I, I - It's a tough one.
michael_scott It is a tough one.
david_wallace I don't have any ideas for you there.
michael_scott Yeah. But one would be good.
david_wallace Hey, oh, okay. Wait.
michael_scott Okay.
david_wallace I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
michael_scott Okay.
david_wallace Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. Picks it up!
michael_scott So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
david_wallace No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
michael_scott Oh, okay.
david_wallace You-you don't like it.
michael_scott No, I think it is-
david_wallace No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh... It's like shop-vac. Did I say that?
michael_scott Yep.
david_wallace It'll be ok.
andy_bernard Hey, any fun weekend plans?
erin_hannon No, you?
andy_bernard Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
erin_hannon Nothing. It's wide open.
andy_bernard Okay.
andy_bernard That's as hard as I can hint.
david_wallace Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
michael_scott The what?
david_wallace Suck it. That's what it's called.
michael_scott Oh, okay.
david_wallace Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.
michael_scott Like it.
michael_scott There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.
michael_scott See you later.
david_wallace Oh, Michael.
michael_scott Bye now.
david_wallace Thank you for coming.
michael_scott Thanks for having me.
michael_scott Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
michael_scott Hello. Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
michael_scott You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
michael_scott Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.
all@ Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot.
michael_scott But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
angela_martin That's your toast?
michael_scott No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
phyllis_vance Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
michael_scott Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
kevin_malone Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
michael_scott Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
all@ To us and to Sabre.
michael_scott Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
david_wallace Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
teddy Suck it!
david_wallace Yeah!
teddy Suck it!
david_wallace Yeah!
teddy Suck it!
david_wallace Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
teddy Suck it!
david_wallace Yeah!
teddy Suck it!
david_wallace Yeah!
all@ Take out my Suck It and we'll suck it.
david_wallace Yeah! Teddy!
teddy Yeah.
