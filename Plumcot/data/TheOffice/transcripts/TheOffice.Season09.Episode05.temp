dwight This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
erin 
dwight It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made.
dwight My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but .
jim It won't budge.
dwight I can't get it out. Try again!
dwight I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin.
dwight Jim, no. No. No! No!
dwight But as jim and I discovered. No! . any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
dwight At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
erin Hey guys.
pam Hey.
erin Pam, what are you?
pam I am Dr. Cinderella.
jim Cece's really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
pam I'm an oncologist and you are a dog.
erin No, I'm a puppy. Dang it! I was worried that would happen.
jim It's Okay.
erin Uh, Jim, you're not dressed up at all.
jim Sure I am. I am. one of the Men in Black guys. Can I have your sunglasses?
erin Jim, come on. I thought we were past this.
pam So the sports marketing business that jim told everyone about except for me?
jim There's a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
pam Unless he has a secret costume that he told everyone about except for me.
jim Gettin' a lot of mileage out of this, aren't ya?
pam Yeah, well, get used to it, bud.
andy A jitterbug. You guys look great! Just a reminder. The party is right after lunch, so make sure you get all your work done before that or throw it out. Any questions?
angela The senator will be joining us later.
andy Not a question.
angela No, it wasn't.
andy Excellent. That reminds me, has anyone seen Treble? Anyone? I could have sworn I saw some Treble somewhere.
hct 
andy Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
hct 
andy Aaah! So good!
dwight What lab did these little clones escape from?
andy My Cornell a capella group.
pam You were in an a capella group?
darryl You went to Cornell?
andy Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because hct is doing a set at our halloween party.
stanley Ugh. I don't want to sit through a whole concert of that.
clark I do. I love the boss's interests.
andy Atta boy Clark!
meredith Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
andy No. Nope. Nope nope nope. Stay away.
andy You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared.
jim Are you sure you're okay with me putting in this much money.
pam Yeah. I mean, listen if we're gonna do this thing, we should do it right.
jim You're the best.
pam I kind of am. It's crazy.
jim Okay. I'll see you in a little bit.
pam Okay.
dwight Jim. Look I'm eating you.
jim Shut up.
dwight Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I'm eating Jims.
erin 
dwight Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
erin Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
dwight Oh no, I'm spilling jim all over the carpet.
erin Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
dwight Hello little pill. What do you do?
dwight Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear.
translation There's a madman in our midst.
pam Okay I give up. What are you?
nellie I'm sexy Toby.
pam Gross. I love it.
dwight Dumatril!
nellie Something wrong Dwight?
dwight Dumatril.
nellie Yes?
dwight This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it's not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body. It's for a disorder of the mind.
nellie The mind is part of the body.
dwight Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane. They are now off their meds.
nellie Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business so-
dwight Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on Nellie? Talk to me.
nellie Hm?
nellie It's my pill. I have an anxiety issue and I'm not ashamed of that, But I'm not loving the idea of dwight having that information. I once saw him yell at Phyllis for sneezing wrong.
nellie Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended.
dwight I'll get my apprehension kit.
andy Ruh duh duh da dudes! What's up?
hct 
andy I know that it's pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay? Because I was a freaking rock star in college. When I joined Here Comes Treble, that's when I became somebody. When I got the nickname "Boner Champ, " that is when I became me.
andy You didn't come here to sit in a room, right? You came here for some intergenerational bro time. Well, now's your chance! I'm here. You got Qs; I got As. hct Member #1
 Did you say you've got AIDS?
andy No, I don't have AIDS. That's not what I said. Next question.
andy You don't have any-- Any questions about the old days? You at least want to know why they call me Boner Champ? hct Member #2
 I thought Broccoli rob was the Boner Champ.
andy I'm sorry, what? hct Member #2
 I just thought Broccoli rob was the Boner Champ.
andy Broccoli rob was Broccoli Rob. andy Bernard is the Boner Champ.
pete I didn't realize that everybody here dresses up every year.
creed Me neither.
creed It's Halloween. That is really, really good timing.
andy I was just talking to some of the actives, and they think that you're Boner Champ. Broccoli
rob I'm so sorry! I don't know how that could have happened.
andy Did you maybe tell them that or. ? Broccoli
rob I just-- I just started yappin' about the old days, and I guess the wine coolers were flowing, and, you know, somehow things just got hinky.
andy Could you just call them and tell them the truth? 'Cause I know it's really stupid, but it's also really, really, really important. Broccoli
rob Will do. I love you, Andy.
andy Love you too. Businessman #1
 So the workspace looks awesome.

dwight Hi Daryl. I'm just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
nellie You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
dwight That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound. crazy?
darryl I can't really picture it. Can you. get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
dwight So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
darryl Get under your chin first. Yeah.
dwight Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
darryl Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
dwight Is that how they like to get in?
darryl Yeah, that's crazy.
dwight I don't know. I just don't know.
andy Yo! Bad boys of a capella.
hct Hey.
andy Heard any good stories lately? Or new twists on old stories? hct Member #3

andy Did he tell you how I got the name? hct Member #3

andy Spring sing ‘95. Got completely ripped on Bud Dries. I had s*x with a snowman. I just went at that thing. Cold would have stopped most people but I stayed locked in, you know. Took the face off. It just seemed easier that way.
angela And I told Phyllis not to put it out, but she insisted. So, anyway. Hi! Oh, Oscar, remember my husband, the senator?
oscar Senator Lipton, nice to see you. Senator
lipton Nice to see you Oscar.
angela Wait a second, who designed this spread? The sweets and savories are all mixed together. This is mayhem! Senator

erin What is with these turkeys?
andy Right?
erin Hey! You better do ‘Faith. ' You get me? hct Member #3

erin So learn it. You all go to Cornell, you're like eight Rain men. Just learning the friggin' song. hct Member #3
 Look, I know it was big with the old guys, but--
erin Buts. are for pooping. Okay? Make it work. You have to or andy will flip out. And make it a surprise, please. This isn't stupid.

nellie Yes.
toby Oh my goodness, look. Look at this.
nellie Yeah. I.

nellie Yes. I thought I'd you know, be you.
toby Look at. Look at me.
nellie It's funny right?
dwight all right. all right, just . stay focused on the pill.
nellie Okay, look Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
dwight You think I don't have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I've got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne'er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don't need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
meredith Cool. Free upper.
dwight Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
meredith Don't dog catch me!
dwight Gotcha! Yeah! Let's see ya get out of this web, huh?

nellie The pill is mine.
dwight What?
nellie Get her out.
dwight Oh.
meredith Stop baggin' my head!
nellie Oh Dwight, look, its just a pill, all right? It's for anxiety. I take it every day. And it makes me feel better. And maybe it could help you too.
pam Hey, how'd it go?
jim Oh man, it was great. They were great.
pam Did you end up investing?
jim I did, yeah.
pam How much?
jim Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about. ten.
pam About ten?
jim Ten. It was the full ten.
pam Wow.
jim Yeah.
pam Wow.
jim Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to.
pam No yeah. Yeah.
jim Yeah.
pam So did everybody .
jim What is it?
pam Did everybody end up investing ten thousand?
jim Um, oh man, I don't actually know.
pam What?
jim They weren't really talking that much about money. They just said, We're good with investing and then I. and I.
andy Ladies and gentlemen, Here Comes Treble!
hct 
pam They said they were done with the investing and then you volunteered ten thousand dollars?
jim No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
pam So you invested ten thousand dollars to look like a team player?
jim You weren't there.
hct 
jim It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had. we should talk about it later.
hct 
pam Talk about it now.
jim Pam.
pam Jim, that was most of our savings.
hct 
clark Wait! Wait. Hold on. Where's the band? ‘Cause there's just no way you guys are making this magic with just your mouths.
creed Yeah. That's what she said.
clark What, am I overdoing it? No. No.
hct 
pam We said some. We said ‘some. '
jim We'll talk about it later.
hct 
pam We said part not all.
hct 
clark Yes! all right!
andy Oh Man!
clark That's how you do that! Whoo!
hct Thank you.
stanley Show some pride. This is crap.
dwight I agree. Yes, crap. Continue. hct Member #3
 Now folks, by special request, we're going to take it a little old school. There is a former Trebler in this room.
darryl Who? hct Member #3
 It's Mr. andy Bernard!
all 
hct 
andy No. Do not sing that. Do not. Oh man. hct Member #3
 He reminded us today of how much he means to us. And we certainly seem to mean a lot to him, so without any further ado, here's an old Treble classic.
hct Broccoli
rob 
andy Whoa! Whoa! What the hell is Broccoli rob doing here? hct Member #3
 She said you wanted to hear ‘Faith'. That's Broccoli Rob's signature song.
andy That's my signature song. hct Member #3
 I really didn't know that man. I just thought you wanted to hear it.
andy Russell, I'm dressed like George Michael. hct Member #3
 I thought you were Adam Lambert.
andy Wha. ?
erin The more I hear about all this a capella drama, the more I think it's kind of pathetic. But when you're with someone, you put up with the stuff that makes you lose respect for them, and that is love.
erin Are you okay? Broccoli
rob He's still mad.
andy Shut up, Broccoli. Broccoli
rob Champ, I feel awful about this whole thing. Russell called me up. And they said they needed 20 cc's of George Michael stat. So just. Wham! I sprang into action. You know me. I assumed you wanted to hear me do your signature number.
andy You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man's signature solo is his for life, okay? That's group policy and you know it. Broccoli
rob Look, it's not my fault that I still live near campus, and it's my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys, and stop in two, three times a week.
andy Just don't do the song anymore. Broccoli
rob I tell you what, we'll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I'll do the same, and I'm so confident that I'll win, I won't even warm up.
andy Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes. Broccoli
rob My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don't you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?
andy I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch! Broccoli
rob He said, and I quote, ‘Hey Rob, nice pipes'. That happened!
andy OK, fine, yeah. that's one guy's opinion! Broccoli
rob That's real. 'That'll never change!
erin Okay!
andy Doesn't mean you're the best singer ever. Dick.
jim I thought that concert was pretty great.
kevin Oh yeah. I decided that acapelca music is awesome.
angela They lost me when they sang ‘Monster Mash'. That song obviously glorifies the occult.
jim Angela, it's Halloween. You have to sing ‘Monster Mash'.
pam Oh you have to Jim? You literally have to?
jim Uh.
pam No I'm just, I'm saying, what would happen if they didn't sing it? Would they go to jail? Would they be shot?
jim Okay. We'll, just forget it.
pam No! No, I'm interested. I mean I think everybody's interested in why they have to sing it.
jim Because it is Halloween. So if you're going to sing a concert, it's a good idea to throw that one in.
pam Yeah, yeah, no, no. It's a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can't do if you just keep singing ‘Monster Mash. '
kevin It turns out, that Pam? Really, really hates ‘Monster Mash. ' I mean like, never bring that song up in front of her. Even though jim was making great points, like, in favor of the song, pam was like, No! Hate it! Stupid!
andy This is all so silly right? What am I gonna do? Move back to Cornell?
erin Yeah.
andy I mean, what if we did that? Like we got jobs and we were happy all the time?
erin Oh well, Andy, we're not moving to Cornell.
andy Duh. I know. That would be insane.
erin Yeah.
andy It could totally work though. I don't know why we wouldn't. Oh my god are we doing this?
erin Oy. Andy, what's going on?
andy If I am not Boner Champ, I don't know who I am.
erin Well, um, you know maybe you're the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
andy Make a donation.
erin Well, I was gonna say, be a mentor.
andy Yes. I am gonna make a donation. And it just so happens that I know someone who works at the Bernard Family Foundation. Her name is mom.
erin Oh.
dwight I want some of those pills.
nellie Oh, well good for you. I mean, you'll need a prescription.
dwight Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
nellie Mm. Got it. Well, you tell Mose that he's a good man and that I hope he feels better.
dwight Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
nellie The real Mose.
dwight He says Thank you.
andy Mom, I had this really charitable idea to set up this scholarship for a capella kids at Cornell and just need to wire some money over there. What?
erin What's wrong?
andy My parents are broke.
