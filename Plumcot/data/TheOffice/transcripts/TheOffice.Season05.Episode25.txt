erin_hannon Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest!
erin_hannon Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
dwight_schrute Shut up.
dwight_schrute I got her!
pam_beesly Not cool, Dwight.
jim_halpert Not cool.
michael_scott Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
michael_scott Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
dwight_schrute I do.
michael_scott Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
pam_beesly Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
michael_scott Oh, really? Ok.
pam_beesly Just sent it.
michael_scott What about the rest of you?
michael_scott At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
michael_scott Who else? Who else? Ryan?
ryan_howard I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
ryan_howard Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
michael_scott Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
angela_martin No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
phyllis_vance Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
michael_scott What?
phyllis_vance Work.
michael_scott Ugh! God! What happened to you people? We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
pam_beesly If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
pam_beesly Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
michael_scott I... was just learning... to... love.
erin_hannon Hi, guys. How you doing?
dwight_schrute Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
erin_hannon Right. I'm sorry.
dwight_schrute Now, how can I help you?
erin_hannon Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
dwight_schrute Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
pam_beesly So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
dwight_schrute It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
erin_hannon Sure.
jim_halpert There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
pam_beesly We're getting married today.
jim_halpert So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
pam_beesly Tell 'em how it happened.
jim_halpert Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
pam_beesly And very expensive.
jim_halpert Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
pam_beesly You can't leave anyone out.
jim_halpert No one.
pam_beesly Ok, just get to the good part.
jim_halpert Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you."
pam_beesly I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
erin_hannon Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
michael_scott No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
erin_hannon Well, I like to swim.
michael_scott That's good.
erin_hannon You have a cool place to come hang.
michael_scott If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
erin_hannon Thanks.
michael_scott Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
erin_hannon Wow.
michael_scott Now you got it.
erin_hannon Now I do got it.
michael_scott Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
erin_hannon Oh, yeah.
michael_scott You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
erin_hannon That's rule #1.
michael_scott Ok. I love it. I love it.
erin_hannon Whew.
michael_scott I love it.
michael_scott Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
michael_scott Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like Dave died or something.
michael_scott Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
oscar_martinez Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
michael_scott I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
andy_bernard Wittle Andy is afwaid.
michael_scott Andy's afwaid?
andy_bernard Yes.
michael_scott Are you all afwaid?
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott Funk is the problem and the solution.
jim_halpert That makes sense.
michael_scott I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
oscar_martinez Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
michael_scott Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
dwight_schrute All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
meredith_palmer This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
michael_scott No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
andy_bernard It's like a haunted disco.
michael_scott ... with coffee but without the haunted.
phyllis_vance It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
michael_scott It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
erin_hannon It's a cafe disco.
michael_scott Exactly.
kevin_malone So, like, a disco cafe?
michael_scott Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
michael_scott Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
kevin_malone Yeah.
michael_scott Holdin' down the fort.
kevin_malone Yeah. This place is great.
michael_scott Thank you.
angela_martin Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
kevin_malone I'm sorry.
michael_scott This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
kevin_malone Yeah. Respect the lei.
angela_martin Come.
michael_scott Kevin, stay.
angela_martin Kevin, come.
michael_scott Kevin, stay.
angela_martin Kevin, come.
michael_scott Stay, stay.
angela_martin Come on, right now.
michael_scott Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
angela_martin Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
kevin_malone Is there a cookie?
michael_scott Mmm-hmm.
angela_martin Wha -
michael_scott Come on.
angela_martin Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
kevin_malone I wanted a cookie.
angela_martin Completely unacceptable.
michael_scott Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.
andy_bernard Everybody Dance Now", spins in chair] Oww!
phyllis_vance Aw, what the hell? Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
jessica Oh, he's on a call.
phyllis_vance Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
jessica It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
phyllis_vance Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
jessica I'll let him know.
phyllis_vance Mmm-hmm.
michael_scott Phyllis?
phyllis_vance Hi.
michael_scott Hey!
phyllis_vance Hey. I like.
michael_scott Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
phyllis_vance Oh! Mother ******!
michael_scott Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
phyllis_vance Back!
michael_scott Oh, wow! What did you do?
phyllis_vance
michael_scott You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
phyllis_vance Wow! Sorry!
michael_scott Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
dwight_schrute Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
michael_scott No. No. No.
dwight_schrute Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
phyllis_vance It's my back.
michael_scott It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
phyllis_vance Call a doctor.
michael_scott We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
phyllis_vance No. Call Bob.
michael_scott Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
dwight_schrute Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
michael_scott I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
dwight_schrute What do you think history is?
michael_scott It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
michael_scott Alright. Here we go.
dwight_schrute Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
michael_scott You having fun?
erin_hannon Oh, my God! What happened?
michael_scott What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
phyllis_vance What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
dwight_schrute You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
michael_scott Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
oscar_martinez What happened to Phyllis?
michael_scott Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
angela_martin Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
michael_scott Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything.
stanley_hudson I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
michael_scott You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
erin_hannon Yes.
michael_scott I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
erin_hannon Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
michael_scott I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
kelly_kapoor Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
erin_hannon You're bad.
lynn Refrigeration Guy 1 There's girl in there.
lynn Refrigeration Guy 2 Where?
VRG#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode25 1 The other room?
VRG#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode25 2 What other room?
VRG#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode25 1 Down the hall.
VRG#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode25 2 There's girls in there?
VRG#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode25 1 What'd I just say?
VRG#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode25 2 You have another sandwich?
VRG#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode25 1 Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls.
michael_scott I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
dwight_schrute You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
phyllis_vance Dwight! Dwight!
dwight_schrute Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
phyllis_vance I do.
dwight_schrute No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. It's like children singing Christmas carols.
andy_bernard Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
erin_hannon Ashley! You made it!
oscar_martinez You invited someone?
erin_hannon Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
oscar_martinez I've been here 8 years and I've never... Rude.
andy_bernard I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
michael_scott Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
creed_bratton I hear it, too, Boss.
michael_scott It's better than I imagined it!
phyllis_vance That feels good, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Tell me where it hurts.
leo Right... mmmm... right there.
dwight_schrute Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
michael_scott Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
erin_hannon Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
angela_martin Stop!
michael_scott Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
angela_martin No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
michael_scott Oh. Alright. There you go.
angela_martin No. You need to sign them all.
michael_scott No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
angela_martin Look, I hate to be "that" person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
michael_scott I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you." No.
dwight_schrute This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
phyllis_vance An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
dwight_schrute Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
creed_bratton Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
michael_scott Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
creed_bratton No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna with the python.
phyllis_vance But the rattler's so scary.
dwight_schrute No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
phyllis_vance I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.
dwight_schrute What's so funny?
phyllis_vance When I say it out loud it's so silly.
michael_scott Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
angela_martin You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
michael_scott No... cleaning... up.
jim_halpert These are for you.
pam_beesly They're beautiful.
jim_halpert You ready?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
michael_scott Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
phyllis_vance Wanna dance, Dwight?
dwight_schrute Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
bob_vance Vance Mind if I steal my wife?
dwight_schrute You can't steal what is legally your property.
bob_vance Vance Are those staples?
andy_bernard This dance competition is not over.
kelly_kapoor What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
michael_scott You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
jim_halpert We're gonna stay.
michael_scott Really?
jim_halpert Yeah. At least for one more dance.
michael_scott Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y".
pam_beesly This is so cheesy.
jim_halpert Yes.
pam_beesly I like cheesy.
jim_halpert Me, too.
pam_beesly Yeah. I think maybe I want a "wedding" wedding.
jim_halpert Me, too.
pam_beesly Really?
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Would you like to dance?
angela_martin No.
andy_bernard Yeah. No. Well, ok.
kelly_kapoor Stop squirming.
andy_bernard Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
kelly_kapoor You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
andy_bernard I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
kelly_kapoor I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
andy_bernard Are you sure that's not the "gay" ear?
kelly_kapoor Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
andy_bernard Well, I...
kelly_kapoor Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
andy_bernard Count to twen - count to twenty.
kelly_kapoor No. I'm gonna count to 3.
andy_bernard K
kelly_kapoor 1... 2... 3
andy_bernard Agh! Son of a bitch!
kelly_kapoor Andy, that was just the ice.
andy_bernard It was?
kelly_kapoor Yeah. It was.
