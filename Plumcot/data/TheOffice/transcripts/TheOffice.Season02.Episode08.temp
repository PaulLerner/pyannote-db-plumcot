dwight You should get one of these.
jim No. Thank you.
dwight Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
jim Done.
dwight This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. Sorry.
jim S'ok.
dwight Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x.
jim You're not having s*x.
dwight Plus, improves your reflexes see, I would have caught that.
jim Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
dwight It's only twenty-five bucks.
jim Wow. Um, ok.
michael Pam, could I see you in my office?
pam It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect.
michael Pam, you're trustworthy-
pam Thank you.
michael And a woman-
pam Oh, no.
michael And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon. " First impressions?
pam Uh, just off the top. I think she'll be here this afternoon.
michael My boss is coming in today, the lovely jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual.
michael "I guess I missed you. " I guess I missed you. So, she misses me?
pam She missed you.
michael But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
pam I have one idea of what it means.
michael Ok. Yeah, what, what?
pam Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
michael Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-
pam Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings. for you.
michael Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
pam Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
michael Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you".
dwight Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review.
jim Ok.
dwight Tell michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
jim We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
dwight Oh, yes, we do.
jim No, we don't.
dwight Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
jim Alright. well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
dwight Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?
jim I win.
dwight Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid.
jim Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
dwight Uh, duh.
jim Duh.
jim Today is Thursday. But dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
stanley Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
michael Really?
stanley Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses.
michael God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry.
stanley Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact.
michael No kidding.
stanley It's all about my bonus.
pam michael and jan definitely made out.
jim Ohh.
pam Maybe more.
jim Eck!. Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'.
pam Oh, yea!
michael Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn.
angela I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
pam Michael?
michael Yeah?
pam Jan's on the phone for you.
michael Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
michael Interesting. jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. Yeah?
jan Michael.
michael Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?
jan I am returning your many calls.
michael Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
jan No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
michael Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
jan Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
michael Oh.
jan I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
michael Been thinking about you.
jan Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
michael Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
jan Michael.
michael Yep.
jan Are the cameras with you.
michael No.
jan . in your office?
michael They are not. Yes, they are. That's my girlfriend.
kevin I heard they made out and had s*x.
oscar No, they just made out. That's it.
kevin Well, I heard they made out and had s*x.
angela Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
kevin Romances?
michael Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A "Michael-idea" folder?
pam Sorry.
michael That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.
pam What suggestion box?
michael The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?
pam Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
michael Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs. never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a. s. a. p.
ryan Don't you mean constructive criticism?
michael What did I say?
kelly You said "constructive complements"; that doesn't make any sense.
michael Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?
jim Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11
 15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a.
dwight Saturday.
jim . Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
jan We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. Could you please tell michael that I'm here?
pam Sure.
michael Hi, Jan. How are you?
jan I'm good; how are you?
michael Good to see you.
jan Nice to see you.
michael Ok. Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here.
jan Can we please go in your office?
michael Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. No calls.
kevin Oooo.
michael Alright .
jan Thank you.
michael It's nice to see you.
jan Nice to see you too, Michael.
michael Really?
jan Not like that.
michael Oh, well.
jan You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
michael Alright.
jan Period.
michael Yep.
jan Do we understand each other.
michael Absolutely.
michael I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because "Oh, I regret that. " But, "Wait, I'm still gonna call you. " But, but, "We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job. " But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business. . push;
jan So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
michael No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual. We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?
jan No.
michael This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.
jan Fine.
michael Are you wearing a new perfume today?
jan How is that a business question?
michael Well, you're wearing it at the office. And it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.
jan Please don't smell me, Michael.
pam Hey, Jim.
jim Hey, how's it goin'?
pam Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night?
jim Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
pam Can you believe who Trump fired?
jim No, that was unbelievable.
dwight Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?
pam You didn't see it?
dwight No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
michael I don't understand- Hold on. Sorry. Yes, Pam.
pam Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
michael I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
pam You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when jan was here.
michael I did not, not, not use those words.
jan Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting is it happening right now?
michael No, it's in like ten minutes.
pam Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
jan Great. Very good.
michael Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number
one "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?"
dwight What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
kelly I thought you read these every week.
michael Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally.
dwight It happens occasionally.
michael And, um, one down. Next
suggestion "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
jan That sounds serious, Michael.
michael Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
dwight Tom?
michael Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
phyllis Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. Tom? Pow.
michael Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.
dwight Next suggestion.
michael Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B. O. "
dwight You need to do something about your B. O.
michael Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
toby Aren't the suggestions meant for you?
michael Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B. O, then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
creed Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring.
michael Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
dwight You need-
michael Ok.
dwight To do something about-
michael Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
angela Sometimes you talk to us real close.
michael Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-
angela Well, when you have coffee breath-
michael I'll work on that-
angela It's hard.
michael Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
dwight Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
michael Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
dwight Next suggestion.
michael "Don't sl-", ok, that's blank Don't, just put it-
dwight "Don't sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
jan I can't, I can't-
michael I don't understand why you're so upset.
jan Please sit down.
michael Let me ask you-
jan You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
michael Ok, let me ask you this.
jan Please, sit yourself down.
michael Let me ask you something.
jan What, Michael.
michael Where did you get your outfit?
dwight You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise! Yes! Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because. I'm awesome! I am awesome!
michael I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
jan Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
michael Look-
dwight Michael?
michael Oh my God.
dwight I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out?
jan No, Dwight; come in.
dwight Great.
michael What do you want Dwight?
dwight I am ready for my performance review.
michael Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye.
jan Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
michael You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
dwight Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
michael Why on earth would we give you a raise?
dwight That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one
word dedication. I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays.
michael You do? How do you get in?
dwight I have a copy of your key.
jan That's a serious offense!
michael That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.
jan Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
dwight I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
michael Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
dwight For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
michael That was deer!? Gross, oh!
dwight You liked it!
michael Oh, did not!
dwight Jan, have you ever had deer?
jan No.
dwight It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
michael What do you say, Jan?
jan Ok! Here's what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
michael Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
jan Thank you, Dwight.
jan Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. Do you have a light?
dwight And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of".
michael That's from Superman?
dwight Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
pam Do you think michael and jan actually.
jim I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam.
pam How do you come back from that?
jim Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together.
pam No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
jim Oh-
pam As a human being.
jim Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
jan I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
michael Wait.
jan 'K?
michael Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
jan Michael, now is not the time or the place.
michael Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
jan No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
michael Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
jan Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever. '
michael I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
jan Michael, it has nothing-
michael Am I too short?
jan With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b. o, but you are very, very inconsiderate.
michael Really?
jan Really. You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
michael I appreciate that, thank you.
jan And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
michael No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-
jan At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but. ok?
michael So my looks have nothing to do with it?
jan Ohhh, God.
michael jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed; I'm good. I can go home now.
michael Hey, it's 12
 20; where the hell's Dwight?
jim Ummm. no idea.
michael Never missed a day, my ass.
pam Thank you.
dwight I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
