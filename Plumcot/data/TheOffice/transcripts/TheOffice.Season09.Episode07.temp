andy Ah, what else? I've seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times. Breaks my heart every time, you know?
everyone Whoa!
pam Andy.
andy That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
phyllis Don't you have any sunblock?
andy No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They're like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
erin Last week andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family's boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
andy Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That's what I call the sun now.
darryl Andy, it's Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
andy What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
erin Oh, Andy, was. was that your drinking water?
andy Yeah, it was. That's okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out. Ow!
everyone Oh!
andy Ah! That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know?
darryl He's been sailing for two days.
andy I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
erin Yeah.
andy No. No! Nooo!
erin Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
dwight dwight Schrute. Well, hi there david Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
david Well, I have some very exciting news.
dwight And you didn't call jim - that seems significant.
jim Hi, David.
david Jim, good! You should hear this too.
dwight No, he shouldn't.
jim Go ahead David, I'm listening.
dwight Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but. I don't know where I'd put you.
david Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They've apparently just dropped the supplier they've been with for the last ten years. .
dwight The White Pages.
dwight The White
pages Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There's a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing "the White Whale". Look at all that sweet blubber.
david Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
dwight I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat. where's Stanley?
erin He's in the bathroom.
dwight Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
erin Of course.
dwight Yeah! Okay. Hey David, I'm back.
erin Eat it Stanley!
dwight So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
david No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It's someone new but she didn't catch her name.
dwight Her name?
phyllis No, hey, dwight shouldn't.
dwight Shhh! Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
david Good luck!
dwight Good luck to you.
phyllis Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them.
dwight That is a damnable lie. I love women.
phyllis Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ‘gy-na' for your entire meeting.
nellie Ew. That's not good.
phyllis Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
dwight ‘Gy-na' said that?
phyllis Guys, we can't let dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses. Pizza Friday could come back.
meredith Hey remember that week in the 90's when we got bagels?
creed I miss Clinton.
pam Can you go instead?
jim I can't. I have the thing.
jim I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I'm helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I've ever been excited about work. So, that feels. wrong.
pete Okay, call down. It's just me, not Tom Selleck. Guys in
breakroom 
kevin Nice!
pete toby got us all to participate in Movember. It's a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
clark So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
darryl Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
toby I have very fertile hair glands.
toby I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
clark God!
toby We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
toby Smile if you love men's prostates.
angela Hi.
oscar Hi.
angela Spring cleaning?
oscar More like fall cleaning.
angela I think the senator is having an affair.
oscar This doesn't. I'm sorry. Wha. what?
angela I think the senator is having an affair.
oscar I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela's husband spoon me back to bed.
angela When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
oscar Oh, I'm sure . that's nothing.
angela And he's always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it's Hot Yoga with Blake.
oscar Angela, Blake's also a guy's name so he. may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
angela I don't know.
oscar I just never heard about the senator and yoga.
angela Right.
oscar From you. I'm sure it's probably nothing. But what's with the yoga already?
angela Right?
oscar And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
angela What?
oscar Angela, I'll go with you.
phyllis So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client.
dwight Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
pam You've got this Schrute.
phyllis Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
dwight Hello.
erin Hello.
dwight May I please speak to your boss?
phyllis No, she is the boss.
erin I am? Hmm. Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?
dwight Okay, this isn't working for me, ‘cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
erin He's absolutely right. I'm really struggling.
pam Oh, I'll be the buyer.
dwight 
pam Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
dwight I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
phyllis No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
dwight I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over.
pam Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
dwight I thought it went great.
nellie I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me? Business
partner Okay lets get started.
jim Yeah, I'm here. Are we all on? Business
partner Uh, well you're the only one ‘on' - we're all here.
jim Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months.
kevin That's the winter season, three months.
jim I uh, I have some ideas, actually. Business
partner Are you at your office right now?
jim Uh yeah. Trust me, I'd rather be with you guys. Business
partner Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert.
jim Oh, Sorry, I uh. was just saying that we should uh. Business
partner Whoa. I think there's been a bit of a mistake. We're trying to reach jim Halpert, not Batman.
jim Um, you know what? I. should have just had. I should have just had you call me on my cell. Business
partner Uh, yeah.
jim I'm gonna try a different spot. Okay? Business
partner Okay, yeah.
jim Okay, I'll call you right back.
kevin What's happening in three months?
pam Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their. Are you listening now?
dwight Yes.
pam Okay, well you have to show us.
dwight That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all.
pam Huh. Uh huh.
dwight What are you doing?
pam A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
dwight Kind of.
pam Nellie, why don't you tell dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you're listening.
nellie Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I've commissioned pam to paint there. We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to hit. Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way.
erin It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
dwight I am a person.
erin Yes.
nellie And then we thought we'd . I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he's laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
dwight That's a bit extreme.
nellie No, I'm sorry but that is true.
meredith He's screwed. They're meeting in less than an hour.
phyllis Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage okay? You're the woman, I'm the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
dwight Okay, I'm a woman. I'm a woman. Good?
phyllis Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
dwight Hello.
phyllis Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute! They could be models.
dwight Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my v*g1n*.
meredith Booo! Weird.
nellie No.
phyllis Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It's hopeless. . push;
pam Ten years ago, I didn't care if dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I'm like, that poor gimp is somebody's child.
pam You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
dwight Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders!
pam Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
dwight I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
pam Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber.
dwight Okay, I can do that.
pam Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
dwight He used to fight dogs.
pam Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
dwight Little of this, little of that.
angela Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
oscar Angela! Angela. There.
angela Where?
oscar On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
angela Oh my God! She's so stunningly tiny! She's like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they're doing.
oscar She's repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
angela I've heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I'd like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let's go.
oscar Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
angela Ow.
oscar Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
pete 
toby This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
jim What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in -- Business
partner It was in what? Jim, we're having a lot of trouble hearing you.
jim The. the. the. what I was saying is the real genius was. was in the.
hank Hey! Are those skateboarders back? Business
partner Jim? Jim, are you there?
hank Where are they?
jim It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so .
meredith Who was messing with my van?
jim Nobody! Business
partner Jordan wore them for nobody? We're not following you, Halpert.
jim No, no, no.
hank This ends now!
secretary Have a seat. Um, she will be right in.
pam Oh, great. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don't have it.
secretary Uh. um she'll be right in.
pam Okay, great.
dwight Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
pam Oh my God. It's Jan.
dwight Oh, dear God in heaven.
pam jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
jan You son of a bitch. You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
pam jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
pam Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It's so great to see you.
jan Where's Wallace?
pam What?
jan I was under the impression that david Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
dwight Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.
pam Sorry. Um, david is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent dwight instead.
jan Molly! david Wallace is in Vermont.
molly Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant. And I guess it did get a little confusing ‘cause you said not to tell anyone your name. And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them.
jan Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
molly I'm so sorry Jan.
jan I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, david Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing?
dwight Listening.
jan Stop.
dwight Sorry.
jan Stop that.
dwight Okay.
pam So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give?
jan No, I do.
pam But not to us.
jan Insightful, Pam.
pam You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us.
dwight Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back.
pam What?
jan Pam?
pam Yeah.
jan I'm a very busy woman, so.
pam Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
jan Fine. I will show you one. slide show.
pete Erin, did this call.
erin Uh!
pete What?
erin Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
pete Oh, I'm sorry. It's for the thing.
erin I know. That's great. It just - it makes it look like there's an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
pete Wow.
erin A handsome eyebrow, but, um. it makes your mouth look like an eye socket. which isn't bad.
pete Uh-huh.
erin But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye. fell out. Which is great. It's such a great cause.
pete Yeah.
erin 
jan Mommy, you're a princess. Mommy, you're a superstar. Mommy you're the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
pam Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
jan Aw.
pam And it is so cute how she signs her name.
jan Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
pam Oh, okay. It's just that's how Cece does it with the backwards ‘E's.
jan Cece can't spell her name.
pam Oh, actually she can.
jan Well, it's not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, "Cece" is two letters and "Astrid" is. I mean, there's even some adults who -- who -- who can't spell it.
pam Of course.
jan Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
pam Um. "A". "X"? I don't -- you got me.
jan Don't patronize me.
pam I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better.
angela Okay, we should go now. Let's go.
oscar Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch.
angela Wait. Why are you. Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can't get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire --
oscar Please. It's Robert who's enjoying it.
angela What?
oscar This could be the affair that you're scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. But uh, he's probably not gay. He's straight. He's straight, so.
pam Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
jan No.
dwight Jan. You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I've got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
pam Oh, my God.
clark Where's the Quizno's?
dwight You're the Quizno's. Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant. Hunter. Was that his name?
jan I -- I --
dwight Hmm?
jan I don't recall. And yes, molly is crap.
pam Okay, you do not have to do this.
clark Do what? Get into sales? That's what I want.
dwight He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do. So young.
jan Will you uh, you. Can you turn around for me, please? dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
dwight Very good.
jan Do you have a valid passport?
jim jim Halpert.
colin Hey, it's Colin.
jim Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
colin I know. Don't worry about it.
jim 
colin It's just. it's not totally working.
jim Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don't worry. I'll figure it out.
colin Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this.
jim Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
angela Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
oscar I don't know, Angela. I'm dehydrated. Maybe. You heard me wrong. We should just go.
angela Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
oscar He's making a phone call.
angela Oh. Oh.
oscar 
pam Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
molly Thanks. Okay.
dwight Oh and uh, Molly. I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
pam Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
dwight Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
pam That's a license number?
dwight That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
pam Oh. Why me?
dwight Because you are my friend and you are a woman. And women love gossip. It's like air to you people. Ugh, God.
