dwight_schrute Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. "Scranton Mimeograph Corp?" I don't think we're doing business with them any time soon. That's odd. A letter from Robert Dunder. "A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance." The Holy Grail.
pam_beesly Did you send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
jim_halpert I think I'm a little too busy these days to s--- Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
jim_halpert The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
kevin_malone I don't get it.
dwight_schrute Aha! A lightbulb.
kevin_malone A lightbul--
dwight_schrute A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. Invisible ink.
kevin_malone Whoa.
dwight_schrute "Higher than numbers go." The ceiling above accounting!
angela_martin Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
jim_halpert Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end ...
jim_halpert ...and finds the... fake grail? No grail?
pam_beesly You don't remember?
jim_halpert I don't.
dwight_schrute An "X."
oscar_martinez Annex. It must open something in the annex.
dwight_schrute Oh.
kevin_malone Whoa.
dwight_schrute "Sedes introiti." Seat of entrance.
dwight_schrute
pete_miller What?
oscar_martinez What?
kevin_malone That's a flush.
all@
all@ The warehouse.
pam_beesly There's nothing down here.
jim_halpert Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
dwight_schrute Let's just forget it. Forget it.
nellie_bertram So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
erin_hannon Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
nellie_bertram Wow.
erin_hannon It's just Pete in sunglasses.
nellie_bertram Oh.
erin_hannon And then we had him "Like" Dunder Mifflin.
pete_miller Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them "Like" Derek's "Likes."
erin_hannon So far, we're only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
nellie_bertram You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
erin_hannon All right.
erin_hannon Pete and I work well together -- not that there's anything special about Pete. It could be any guy... or girl-- not that I'm into girls. Not that I'm into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
jim_halpert Hey.
Co-worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch.
jim_halpert Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Co-worker_#2#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Uh sure. No problem.
jim_halpert Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right?
dwight_schrute Pfft, "Athlead"? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it "Stumpany," for "Stupid Company."
darryl_philbin Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That's why I'm doing it.
dwight_schrute You're working for "Stumpany" too?
darryl_philbin Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over.
dwight_schrute What?
darryl_philbin Yep.
dwight_schrute Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
jim_halpert Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
dwight_schrute You won't stop until you've poached us all.
jim_halpert Yeah. Even you.
dwight_schrute No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me.
jim_halpert Bye, Dwight.
jim_halpert Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
pam_beesly Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
kevin_malone Ooh, I haven't heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
pam_beesly Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
angela_martin I have no information. But I'm sure as soon as they know, they'll call you.
pam_beesly Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I'm just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let's be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
pam_beesly Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital.
oscar_martinez Aw.
pam_beesly Hey, Cece, Daddy's gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
cecelia_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Let's call him.
jim_halpert Hey. I was just about to call you.
pam_beesly Hey, Hon, are you close?
jim_halpert I am still in Philly, actually.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board.
pam_beesly Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it.
jim_halpert Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
cecelia_halpert I want Daddy.
jim_halpert You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
pam_beesly Of course.
jim_halpert Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
pam_beesly Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
jim_halpert Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you're not the best with the phone.
pam_beesly I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we're getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, "Bye, Daddy."
cecelia_halpert Bye, Daddy.
jim_halpert Bye. Yep. See, you've still got to press "End," Pam.
cecelia_halpert Press "End."
pete_miller Oh, check it out. This is our first real "Like."
erin_hannon Oh, my gosh!
pete_miller Oh! All right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
erin_hannon Wow. That guy's really into paper.
pete_miller Yeah.
nellie_bertram Well done, you two.
erin_hannon We did it. Youth task force forever.
pete_miller Yes.
pete_miller Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
erin_hannon No, you go -- okay.
pete_miller All right, all right.Okay, start over.
nellie_bertram Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. "Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously." I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
dwight_schrute Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
all@
dwight_schrute You're welcome.
phyllis_vance Wait. This says "Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge"?
dwight_schrute This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
oscar_martinez "Loyalty pledge"?
darryl_philbin Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
dwight_schrute Yeah, we'll see about that.
dwight_schrute Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? "Infuriating, irresponsible"...
clark They got us set up with Windows 95, so you're kind of dreaming here.
dwight_schrute Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.
dwight_schrute Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?
kevin_malone Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches.
dwight_schrute Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
mr_romanko Romanko I wouldn't say a rage.
darryl_philbin Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It's very unlikely it would happen again.
mr_romanko Romanko Thank you. Thank you.
dwight_schrute No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? L--
darryl_philbin Loyalty.
dwight_schrute Loyalty.
nellie_bertram Loyalty is exactly right.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
nellie_bertram Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let's all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
stanley_hudson That's none of your damn business.
nellie_bertram Darryl is "dating" Dunder Mifflin.
darryl_philbin Darryl is dating Val... still.
nellie_bertram But he's flirting with Jim's company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to.
mr_romanko Romanko I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here?
dwight_schrute Yes.
nellie_bertram I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
nellie_bertram So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
creed_bratton Let's try it out.
nellie_bertram No, let's-- let's-- let's not say Creed. Let's say Mr. X.
angela_martin Well, I think it would be immoral for Erin to cheat on Andy.
erin_hannon Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy?
angela_martin Yes. And he didn't like it.
phyllis_vance Does Mr. X know that Erin has a boyfriend, or did Erin keep that from Mr. X?
kevin_malone Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say Pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with?

pam_beesly Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Ballerinas#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 One, two, three.
pam_beesly Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? Oh, my God!
Audience#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Shh!
pam_beesly Um, I'm sorry. I have to go. My daughter's a ladybug. I know that doesn't make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.
Parent#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 in audience_#2 You're very rude.
Parent#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 in audience_#1 Yes, very rude.
pam_beesly Shh! Kids are dancing.
dwight_schrute Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
darryl_philbin Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
dwight_schrute It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
darryl_philbin It can.
dwight_schrute Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
phyllis_vance Well, Andy's cute, but he's too vanilla, whereas Pete - he's just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
erin_hannon I'm just gonna say this one more time. Pete and I haven't done anything.
meredith_palmer Yeah right. With slammin' bods like that, they ain't playing checkers.
oscar_martinez People, it's 2013. Erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
erin_hannon Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. Pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete?
pete_miller That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
kevin_malone Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart... and a little bit your pen1s.
all@
erin_hannon Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I'm not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
nellie_bertram I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
nellie_bertram Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You're welcome, Andy. And you're welcome, my own ass.
Investor#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me.
Co-worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?
jim_halpert Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
jim_halpert Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second.
pam_beesly Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
Lonnie#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery.
darryl_philbin I don't do that anymore.
Lonnie#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 That's what they told me.
darryl_philbin
darryl_philbin All right, let's get this over with.
dwight_schrute You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! Here we go! Yeah!
dwight_schrute Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
darryl_philbin How far is this place?
dwight_schrute Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports.
darryl_philbin Fun.
toby_flenderson Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
nellie_bertram Oh, thank you. I don't know, I sort of thought--
toby_flenderson So proud of you, Hon.
nellie_bertram Oh, I don't know. Okay.
toby_flenderson I'm just curious though, what do you have against Pete and Erin?
nellie_bertram Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
toby_flenderson Pete's a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
nellie_bertram I didn't really think about it like that.
toby_flenderson Yeah, well... Not everybody has what we have.
nellie_bertram "What we have"?
toby_flenderson Mm-hmm.
nellie_bertram I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
dwight_schrute Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
darryl_philbin They have fast food in Philly.
dwight_schrute Not like this.
darryl_philbin Exactly like this.
Fast#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Food Worker And your milkshake.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
darryl_philbin It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?
dwight_schrute Nope. Fire in the hole! Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!
dwight_schrute Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
darryl_philbin You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
dwight_schrute It's a youtube thing! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming.
pam_beesly Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital?
angela_martin Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped... with that .
oscar_martinez I'll watch it. Let's get this over with.
pam_beesly All right, you don't have to.
kevin_malone Let's get this over with, Pam.
pam_beesly Okay.
oscar_martinez Oh.
pam_beesly Wait. What?
pam_beesly Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
pam_beesly Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
oscar_martinez User error. I've heard of that happening to other people.
angela_martin Oscar, don't rub it in. I'm sure Pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
pam_beesly Well, it was an important phone call.
pam_beesly I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, "Beesly!" I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- "Beesly!"
pete_miller Hey.
erin_hannon Hello, Peter.
dwight_schrute It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
darryl_philbin You missed a spot.
Drive#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Thru Customer Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!
dwight_schrute Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
nellie_bertram I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
erin_hannon Oh, no, I really don't think that's a good idea.
nellie_bertram Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
pete_miller Well, okay, then.
erin_hannon I guess we don't have a choice.
nellie_bertram Nope.
pete_miller yeah.
erin_hannon Yeah.
toby_flenderson Lady...you never stop surprising me.
dwight_schrute
darryl_philbin
dwight_schrute What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
darryl_philbin No. I was clearing my throat.
meredith_palmer Good night.
pam_beesly Night
creed_bratton Night
pam_beesly Night, Creed.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly So, how's it going?
jim_halpert We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it.
pam_beesly I'm so sorry.
jim_halpert I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
pam_beesly Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard.
jim_halpert Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
pam_beesly Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
jim_halpert You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?
pam_beesly No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
jim_halpert Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
pam_beesly Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
jim_halpert Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.
pam_beesly Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?
jim_halpert Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it.
pam_beesly I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
jim_halpert You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this.
pam_beesly You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
jim_halpert Pam, I'm not explaining this to you-- Pam, I'm not going over this again.
Co-worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Jim. We need you.
jim_halpert I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
pam_beesly I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
jim_halpert I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
pam_beesly Yep.
jim_halpert We'll talk tomorrow?
pam_beesly Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
jim_halpert Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
pam_beesly Bye.
brian Hey, you okay?
pam_beesly What am I doing wrong, Brian?
brian Nothing. You're doing the best you can.
Cameraman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode12 Brian.
brian Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
pam_beesly
brian Hey, it's just a tough situation, all right?
pam_beesly It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard.
brian Yeah. Let's turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
pam_beesly Thank you.
