dwight Could you please sign my expense report?
michael No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
dwight Sign this.
jim Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals.
dwight Sign it.
jim No, not without a "please. "
dwight Idiot.
dwight I have a complaint about Jim.
michael That is not big picture.
dwight I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
michael . Okay.
dwight jim won't sign my expense report.
michael That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
dwight No, that is huge.
michael You're trying to trick me.
dwight This has to do--
michael Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
dwight I'd like to lodge a complaint.
jim I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
dwight You!
jim Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So. When did this happen?
dwight One minute ago.
jim Okay. And how do you feel?
dwight Angry.
jim All right. Did he hit you?
dwight No.
jim Did you cry?
dwight No.
jim Did you feel like crying?
dwight No.
jim I'm just gonna write "held back tears. "
dwight Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
jim If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
dwight I'm not cr-- uhh!
dwight I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! Aha! $18, 000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
erin Dwight, jim wants you to keep it down.
michael Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.
jim Michael.
michael Yes?
jim Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
michael Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
stanley Can I also be a boss?
oscar Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that any organization thrives when it has two leaders. Go ahead, name a country that doesn't have two presidents. A boat that sets sail without two captains. Where would Catholicism be without the popes?
jim I have noticed that we--
michael Welcome.
jim Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.
michael Mm-hmm.
jim And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
michael Disruptive.
jim Yes.
michael No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
jim Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.
michael Let's do.
jim Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
michael N-- well, to be fair, Jim. James. Jimothy. To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
jim I am.
michael Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets.
jim Right.
michael At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
jim Yes, I agree.
michael Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.
jim I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.
michael You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
jim You mean on a weekend?
michael Yes.
jim How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.
michael Alright. No more meetings this week.
jim Really? You just agreed to that?
michael I can be very suprising.
phyllis What's going on?
pam I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.
ryan You know, it's a myth that women have to gain more than nine pounds in a pregnancy. Look at these actresses. Some of them lose weight.
phyllis Hey, did you guys register for wedding gifts?
pam We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry. However much.
pam It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate &amp; Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?
phyllis Perfect. I hate registries.
pam Oh, good.
phyllis My cousin makes the most amazing romantic birdhouse mailboxes. I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll still be suprised when you see it. You're not registered for a birdhouse, are you?
pam No, we're not.
phyllis Good. Good.
michael Mm-hmm?
jim Okay, I thought I saw people missing.
michael Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
jim Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing michael said before I came through the door?
michael Stanley, you don't need to answer that.
jim Stanley?
stanley "If you don't smell this, you're fired. "
jim Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
michael What do you mean by "these people"?
jim Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
michael Oh, hey, everybody, I think that jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
jim That's not what I meant.
michael Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
jim I disagree.
michael What do you guys think?
jim Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?
michael No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
jim That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.
michael That is not what wallace told us.
jim That's exactly what wallace told us.
michael That is not the way I heard it.
kelly I love rivalries-- michael or Jim, Paris or Nicole, Heidi or L. C. It's so much fun. But I guess if I'm really thinking about it and answEring your question honestly, I'd have to go with L. C. Heidi's a bad friend, and her skin is terrible.
michael It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.
jim I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.
michael No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. I will call David Wallace.
erin David wallace is on line two for you guys.
michael Or David wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--
jim Hey, David. You got jim here.
michael Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager. David
wallace Hey guys, um, I'm calling, because, unfortunately, we will not be able to give out cost of living raises this year, and I know people expect it. However, there just is only a small amount of money for each branch, so we're leaving it up to the managers to decide how to distribute it.
michael Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
jim Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees. David
wallace It's probably a little of both.
michael Which is it more of? David
wallace Excuse me?
jim David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. David
wallace Wait, I'm sorry. Michael, are you-- are you texting me?
michael I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. David
wallace Look, I need you both to take care of this. This is not going to be a problem, is it?
jim Nope, not at all.
michael No, it will not be. I am on top of it. David
wallace Very good.
jim Alright, thanks alot, David.
michael Talk to you later-- Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. Alright, I am looking forward to this.
jim You don't have to lie.
michael I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.
jim Right.
michael All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
jim Alright. Let's get started.
creed Hey, why haven't we ever, um.
meredith We have.
michael You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1. 5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.
jim Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
michael No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.
jim Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.
michael Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
jim It's hard to tell so far.
michael You use your brain too much.
jim I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
michael Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
jim You just came up with that.
michael As I was saying it.
jim Yeah. Okay, so for the 1. 5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.
michael Con-- you look like a nerd.
jim Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
michael Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
jim Pro-- no favoritism.
michael Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there. . push;
jim I've been studying michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- How michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.
kevin Hey, Pam, I heard that you were registered, but I didn't hear where.
pam I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.
kevin Like money? Like you-- you want my money?
pam Mm-hmm.
kevin Will you take a check?
pam Yeah.
kevin Cool. In the memo line, I'm gonna write, "To love's eternal glory. "
pam Okay.
kevin Wait til' Monday.
pam Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. oh look! "Mrs. pam Halpert!" That's the first time I've seen it in writing!
jim You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.
michael That will not go over well.
jim I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us.
michael Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.
jim I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.
michael No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
jim Michael.
michael And then another--
jim Look, you have a lot of strengths.
michael Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
jim I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
michael Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
jim But there is a reason why I'm here!
michael Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
jim No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
michael Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?
jim I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
michael Ah.
jim At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.
michael Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
jim But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.
michael Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? You call it.
jim 
michael This had better be terrible.
jim Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.
meredith Wait. Seriously?!
jim Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
oscar Thank you, Jim, for thinking that we're smart people.
angela But, I do not understand. If we're such smart adults, then why don't we get raises?
oscar Excellent question, genius. It's because jim wants to give the raises to his friends and the people he sleeps with.
jim Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.
oscar Well?
jim Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.
kelly What's going on?
kevin jim is only giving raises to the salesmen.
kelly What the hell?! Why are you being such a jerk?!
oscar Hold on, Kelly. Would it help you to know that jim thinks you're smart?
kelly No! How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
dwight This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
jim Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
dwight What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
oscar Exactly!
kevin Totally!
oscar We work just as hard as the sales people. We deserve raises.
creed Yes.
angela Yes. They don't get 'em, if we don't get 'em!
meredith My kid needs shoes! You want to tell him he doesn't get shoes?!
kevin Yeah.
dwight Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
meredith What the hell?!
jim Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so.
michael That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend oscar a cup of sugar. This--
angela What are you talking about Michael?
stanley We just need to hear your plan for our raise.
michael My plan-- a man-- panama.
andy That's not how that goes.
meredith You're not saying anything. At least jim was being direct.
jim Thank you, Meredith.
meredith . when he was telling us his dumbass plan.
oscar We would just like to know what's happening. Are we getting a raise, yes or no?
michael Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
oscar Again, that gives us no information.
phyllis This isn't a game, you know? It's our livelihood!
michael What about a raise based on merit?
jim Rank each person individually?
michael Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
jim Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started.
michael Are you making a--
jim Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
oscar Just--
kevin Yeah, I don't understand how they can even consider giving money to some people and not the rest of us.
angela It's not like we're not gonna see the checks. We're in accounting!
meredith I am so pissed at this company!
dwight And Jim!
meredith Yeah. Who said that?
dwight I think it was Creed.
creed Yep.
jim It's going really well, actually.
jim Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv-- who's that?
michael Toby.
jim He's not a part of this. You know that.
michael Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
jim Okay, your move.
michael Alright! Who to pick? Who to pick?
jim Here we go.
michael I. will skip a turn.
jim Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
michael I need more time.
erin wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.
dwight People are starting to notice how terrible jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because stanley Washington was napping, and phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
dwight Come on in. That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
oscar What the hell?!
dwight Things were not this bad when just michael was manager.
michael Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
kevin What does a bean mean?
pam Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
kevin Michael, what does a bean mean?
pam Jim?
jim I was just trying to be unbiased.
kevin What does a bean mean?!
oscar Someone please explain it to Kevin.
meredith Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
phyllis Not according to the beans.
angela This is how you make this important decision?
andy There's no way that stanley gets more beans than me. That is ridiculous. This is how it works.
phyllis It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
andy Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.
phyllis Yeah, I would, too.
dwight Are we idiots? What right does jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
phyllis I say no.
dwight No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? Okay.
michael 
kevin What does a bean mean?
michael How you doing?
jim Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
michael Oh, what are you usually?
jim Six. You?
michael Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
jim I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
michael I know, I know.
jim We tried to find the fairest way to do it.
michael Yes, we did.
jim I just-- what?
michael Um, nothing. I just. I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.
phyllis Michael!
kevin Michael!
phyllis Come on! This isn't fair!
jim Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam. I think. Is she still upset?
phyllis Michael, you cannot just keep avoiding us like this!
jim Thank you.
michael You're welcome.
jim What's in here?
michael Gin.
jim Ooh!
michael Just pretend we're not here.
ryan Heard you guys are looking for cash for the wedding?
pam Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.
ryan Question for you. Would you guys rather have $100 now, or $5, 000 a year from now?
pam $100 now for sure.
ryan Because you just give me $50 to cover the broker fee, I put in a hundred of my own money as the gift.
pam Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.
ryan Instead of $5, 000 a year from now?
pam How sure is this?
pam The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.
pam Don't tell Jim.
