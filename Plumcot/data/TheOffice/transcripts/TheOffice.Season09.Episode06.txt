oscar_martinez Can you guys come with me for a minute?
oscar_martinez I know you saw me with the Senator. I think I'm in love, possibly for the first time. So yes, Senator Lipton and I are having an affair. I hope that I can count on your sensitivity, maturity and discretion. ...Why?
andy_bernard Alright, good. Yeah. Just sell it and get the best price you can, okay?
White#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode06 Or we can hope for a holiday rally?
andy_bernard White, I'm not a day trader, I'm just a first responder in a disaster.
pam_beesly Andy's family had a total meltdown. His dad blew through all their money and took off to Argentina with a younger woman.
jim_halpert And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
pam_beesly The weirdest part is Andy. The aftermath got dumped on him and the way he's been handling it is just..so..
jim_halpert Competent.
pam_beesly Right?
andy_bernard Are the 'Nard's hurting? Yeah, you bet. Got kicked pretty hard. Family shattered, super sad. But, I'm kinda crushing it in the damage control department. So, that's cool. I wish my dad could see me now. Of course he caused this whole mess, so, him.
oscar_martinez Kevin, listen to me. I'm in love with the Senator. And I need time to sort this out in a responsible matter so I need your help in keeping it a secret because this means the world to me. Ok?
kevin_malone That's beautiful. No, I totally get that.
oscar_martinez Can you do this, Kevin?
kevin_malone I really want to. Whatever happens, always remember that.
oscar_martinez I don't know what that means. Hey, hey-
pam_beesly Oh, great! Yeah, um, I'll get right back to you. Hey guys! Anyone ever heard of Iris Black on the radio?
creed_bratton Yeah, she hosts the Dr. Laura Show.
pam_beesly Nope, that's Dr. Laura. Well, her show Biz Whiz wants someone from Dunder Mifflin to come on the air today. Does anybody feel particularly passionate about local business issues?
dwight_schrute I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
dwight_schrute The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? "Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt." It's that easy.
meredith_palmer Hey, so that good looking single brother of yours? Heard he's on a downward spiral with booze.
andy_bernard Yeah. He's in rehab actually.
meredith_palmer Which place? The one right near Philly? I could be there in an hour.
andy_bernard No, it's in New Mexico.
meredith_palmer Oh...So..- how are you holding up?
andy_bernard We're done Meredith.
dwight_schrute blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...
jim_halpert Dwight!
dwight_schrute ...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
jim_halpert No, you chose yourself.
dwight_schrute Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
andy_bernard Alright, guys. A lot of assets here that my dad couldn't steal. Now, first of all, there is the family boat. 43 foot Tartan Sloop. My lawyer has lined up a buyer in the Bahamas, the sale would cover the cost of a condo and living expenses for my mom.
darryl_philbin Sounds great.
oscar_martinez Perfect.
andy_bernard Totally, except it is a no go. This boat was the heart and soul of the family. So...what else we got? Non-boat ideas.
kevin_malone What happened?
angela_martin Jammed. This day couldn't get worse.
kevin_malone Yeah, I think this day could get worse.
angela_martin What does that mean?
oscar_martinez Kevin!
kevin_malone I don't know what you're talking about.
erin_hannon She could get like sixty packages of Ramen noodles for five bucks. She could eat for a month.
andy_bernard Alright, what's the grand total? Did we make our nut?
darryl_philbin If we sell everything but the boat, your mom should be set for about six months.
andy_bernard Guys, you don't understand, this boat's been in our family since before I was born.
erin_hannon Don't you guys have that place where you used to spend your summers and have all those memories?
darryl_philbin I worked at a Jiffy Lube.
erin_hannon See? I bet you wouldn't sell that Jiffy Lube for all the money in the world. Would you Darryl?
darryl_philbin I would if I owned it and I went broke.
andy_bernard Alright, uh...alright. I'm gonna tell the lawyer to pull the trigger on the boat.
andy_bernard Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it. What are you gonna do? Cry about it? Excuse me.
pam_beesly Oh, OK. No problem. Thanks. Hey guys, WPTU called. The interview's off. They're opening a new cupcake store at the Steamtown Mall and Iris wants to cover that, so...
nellie_bertram Well why don't I go and tell Dwight so he can stop being such a complete nipple.
pam_beesly He's gonna be disappointed.
jim_halpert Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
pete_miller Fax?
erin_hannon Oh yeah, just. Watermelon teeth. This isn't how I would cheer up just anyone. But, it's a girlfriend's job to know her man and I know Andy. He's seriously juvenile.
pete_miller Cool. He's like 40 though, right?
erin_hannon Oh no, he couldn't be more than late thirty's. Tops.
pete_miller Awesome. Have fun.
dwight_schrute Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- This is Dwight Shrute.
pam_beesly Please hold for Ms. Black.
nellie_bertram And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
dwight_schrute Iris, thank you so much for having me.
erin_hannon Hey! My teeth are all this stuff in my mouth.
andy_bernard Uh, did you need something?
erin_hannon Oh, I just need your signature on this.
andy_bernard Ok. thanks.
angela_martin Kevin, we're out of 11-38 forms. Did you order more?
kevin_malone I... did not.
angela_martin I don't know why I'm surprised. Literally nothing you do could surprise me anymore.
kevin_malone Oh really, Angela? That's interesting. Cause I do think that I could surprise you. I think that I could surprise you..oh! I have to go to the bathroom!
angela_martin That doesn't surprise me.
oscar_martinez That actually wasn't the worst cover. I'd say at least once a week, Kevin runs out of the room shouting that he has to go to the bathroom.
jim_halpert See these forms...
kevin_malone I have to go to the bathroom!
kevin_malone I have to go to the bathroom!
kevin_malone
erin_hannon Ok, who wants to go for a super fun lunch with a super fun girlfriend?
andy_bernard Look, it's not that I don't want-
erin_hannon Ok, come on. I got someone to cover the phones, I heard on the radio about a new cupcake place we could go for dessert...perfect.
andy_bernard All I ever wanted to do was sail the damn thing. But dad wouldn't let me. Said "You can't be a skipper until you're a man." You know, I'd reach for the wheel and he'd smack my hand away. Well guess what? Now I'm the man of the family and... we're selling the damn thing. So I'm never gonna have the chance.
erin_hannon Well, when does the boat leave, exactly?
andy_bernard Tonight.
erin_hannon Then screw lunch. Let's go for a sunset sail.
andy_bernard Yeah right. It's in Stamford, Connecticut. We have to leave like right now.
erin_hannon Ok, well then let's leave like right now.
andy_bernard Yeah, ok.
erin_hannon Yeah! OK! Let's go.
andy_bernard Seriously?
erin_hannon Of course, seriously. Get your coat on.
andy_bernard Alright.
erin_hannon Alright.
andy_bernard Let's do it.
erin_hannon Let's do it!
dwight_schrute Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
nellie_bertram So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
dwight_schrute Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
nellie_bertram Uh, excuse me. I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
dwight_schrute Yes..?
nellie_bertram I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
dwight_schrute Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather-
nellie_bertram Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
dwight_schrute That's impossible.
nellie_bertram Are you by any chance wearing pants with a metallic zipper?
angela_martin The Senator is exhausted. This campaign is wearing him out.
oscar_martinez That's a tough one.
angela_martin That man he's up against is so dirty. And the senator's just pushing back as hard as he can.
kevin_malone Please, stop.
angela_martin What?
kevin_malone Please, stop.
angela_martin Anyways, last night he was tired and just wanted a little Mexican brought in.
kevin_malone I can't, it's too much!
oscar_martinez I'm in big trouble.
kevin_malone Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.
dwight_schrute OK, how is my voice now?
nellie_bertram I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
dwight_schrute This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
oscar_martinez It's clearly not an accounting mistake.
toby_flenderson Yeah.
oscar_martinez So...
toby_flenderson Kevin. His gambling problem must've resurfaced. I'm gonna have to send him home until I can do an investigation.
oscar_martinez Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
dwight_schrute This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
nellie_bertram Well, as it happens we have with us the foreman of your upstate New York paper mill, Sandra Mc...Sandra Mick
pam_beesly Good afternoon Iris, it's a pleasure.
nellie_bertram Let's get straight to the point. Is your paper toxic?
pam_beesly No the paper's not toxic.
dwight_schrute Thank you Sandra!
pam_beesly Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
dwight_schrute Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled!
jim_halpert What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
dwight_schrute Get out of here moron!
nellie_bertram Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
dwight_schrute uhhhh....no one.
nellie_bertram Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
dwight_schrute No, everything's fine.
nellie_bertram Are you insulting my guests?
dwight_schrute
kevin_malone Yeah, I will be right there. Hey Oscar, what if I'm getting a promotion?
oscar_martinez I hope that's it, Kevin.
kevin_malone Me too. Cause then, I would get my own office. And I wouldn't screw up your secret with Angela. I've been really worried about that.
toby_flenderson Hi, Kevin. Look, I need to talk to you about-
kevin_malone Hi.
oscar_martinez Guys? Excuse me. Um, a quick word, please just..
kevin_malone Oscar, we're in the middle of talking.
oscar_martinez Oh, you're right I'm so sorry. Snack machine on me.
kevin_malone Oh that is nice. Classy move.
dwight_schrute That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
kevin_malone What are you doing?
oscar_martinez Those figures I gave you? They're false.
toby_flenderson How?
oscar_martinez I was mad at Kevin, we had a fight and I acted vindictively.
toby_flenderson So you set him up.
oscar_martinez Yes, he's innocent.
toby_flenderson I knew it. I knew it from the beginning it was possible.
oscar_martinez What are you talking about? I just did this now.
toby_flenderson A few years ago, when I was on the jury of the Scranton Strangler..
oscar_martinez Sure.
toby_flenderson I always thought he might have been set up but I felt pressured to convict.
oscar_martinez That's gotta be tough.
toby_flenderson Tough? I put an innocent man on death row.
nellie_bertram The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
dwight_schrute My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
erin_hannon That's yours?
andy_bernard That's the family boat!
erin_hannon Oh my gosh, Andy! This is enormous!
andy_bernard Right?
erin_hannon I thought it was gonna be tiny. Oh my gosh it's beautiful. So this is how your family came to America.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy Move.
andy_bernard Sorry?
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy Trying to rig a boat here. I don't know how to do that when you're standing in the way.
andy_bernard Sure, I um..I didn't know.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy I'm not a ghost, so I can't walk through people.
andy_bernard Ok.
erin_hannon Gee, he was salty.
andy_bernard Geez, a little bit. How you doing old buddy? Missed you.
erin_hannon What does that one do?
andy_bernard It raises the main sail. That was my job when we went sailing.
erin_hannon I wish I had seen you do it.
andy_bernard Really?
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard Up she goes!
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy Don't do that. Don't do that.
andy_bernard Oh, it's OK. My girlfriend and I were actually gonna take her for a little spin and a picnic before you guys head out tonight. You know what? Get some dinner on me.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy Nope. Can't do that.
andy_bernard You got it. You know what then, we'll just take it for a quick little spin around the harbor.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy We've already started boarding. And no one is insured to rig her up right now except us.
andy_bernard You know what? Chill, ok? I own the boat. Not gonna sue myself. Alright, so just- wow.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy I can smack you all day if you keep touching what you're not supposed to touch.
andy_bernard Ok, fine.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy OK.
andy_bernard Yeah, fine.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy Good stuff.
andy_bernard Good stuff. Nice stuff. Damn it! Screw you dad! ..ah.
erin_hannon Well, we're doing it. We're finally having a picnic on the boat.
andy_bernard I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.
erin_hannon Andy, you never had to sail the boat to be a man.
andy_bernard Fine. But I could have.
erin_hannon As long as we're on this boat, as far as I'm concerned, you're the captain.
andy_bernard I am the captain.
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard Right?
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard I'm the captain. Hey, charm school.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy What?
andy_bernard I'm taking it over from here.
erin_hannon Nice!
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy I hate to uh, ruin this moment...or breakdown, but you already signed the papers. So, if you want your boat back, you can pick it up there in the Bahamas in 10 days.
andy_bernard Yeah, I know cause I'm sailing it there.
buyer_of_andys_boat Guy OK, no. I already said, you're not getting back your deposit.
andy_bernard Fine. Good. Keep it. Just leave the supplies, I paid for those. But how much for that cool fisherman sweater?
nellie_bertram For those just joining us, terror in Greenwich. Where police have surrounded the house of Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace. Wallace is said to be despondent over the company's stock plummet and is taking a mailman hostage. On the line, we have chief of Greenwich Police, Mr. Bill Jackson .
jim_halpert Good afternoon!
dwight_schrute Please sir! Spare him. Please.
jim_halpert Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
dwight_schrute Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
nellie_bertram Oh, Mr. Shrute, there's really no need to, um involve Mr... Wallace.
erin_hannon Do you even know what you're doing?
andy_bernard Yeah. Yeah I know how to hoist the mail sail, I know to...I, I, these buttons control boat pumps and stuff. I also know where the booze stash is. So, hello. Walt?
walter_bernard_jr Jr. Oh god, thank goodness you're here. I was having a little trouble with this door. Yesterday. I um, I think it was yesterday.
andy_bernard I thought you were in rehab.
walter_bernard_jr Jr. Yeah, uh, I just, I figured I'd get that first relapse out of the way. God, what's happened to our family? Everything is so messed up! How did you even know I was in here?
andy_bernard I didn't. I, I just came to say goodbye to the boat. But I've decided to sail it to Bermuda.
erin_hannon Bahamas, Andy.
andy_bernard Same thing. Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.
state_senator_rob_lipton Wallace Hello?
dwight_schrute David, is that you?
state_senator_rob_lipton Wallace Dwight?
dwight_schrute Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
state_senator_rob_lipton Wallace Yeah? Are you ok?
dwight_schrute Oh, I'm OK. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
state_senator_rob_lipton Wallace Well, thanks Dwight.
dwight_schrute You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
state_senator_rob_lipton Wallace Dwight?
dwight_schrute Walk out of the house...
state_senator_rob_lipton Wallace What?
dwight_schrute ...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
state_senator_rob_lipton Wallace Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
dwight_schrute Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
all@ Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!
dwight_schrute Shrute! Shrute!
dwight_schrute Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
kevin_malone Well Oscar, I did not get the promotion. He just wanted to update my personal information.
oscar_martinez Well, I am sorry Kevin.
angela_martin Why on earth would you think you were getting a promotion?
kevin_malone You know what Angela? I- Oh my god.
angela_martin Honey! What are you doing here?
buyer_of_andys_boat Liptop I just had a little intuition that someone I loved needed a little bit of attention today. Oscar, you're looking very healthy. Getting lots of vigorous exercise?
oscar_martinez No.
angela_martin Oscar? What is going on? What was that?
buyer_of_andys_boat Liptop What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. I was just trying to be friendly.
oscar_martinez You know what? I'm sorry. I overreacted. Because I'm stressed out. Why am I stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who's not stressed out? Who-
kevin_malone Come on Oscar, we're not just gonna sit here and ignore the obvious. Senator Lipton has a big election next week. We all need to give him our support.
buyer_of_andys_boat Liptop Well, thanks everybody.
kevin_malone It is really cool! U-S-A! U-S-A!
oscar_martinez U..s..a. U-
oscar_martinez I have to say I'm impressed with Kevin. Uh, he showed a lot of self-control.
kevin_malone I totally forgot about the affair for a minute. Oscar is having s*x with the senator and Angela doesn't even know. Her life is a complete sham!
andy_bernard Alright guys, cast us off. Walt, all aboard! Erin, this is because of you. Do you realize that? You're the best ever!
erin_hannon Oh, you know. Just being a good girlfriend.
andy_bernard Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
erin_hannon Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
andy_bernard I'll see you in three weeks!
erin_hannon OK!
walter_bernard_jr Jr. Hey bro! It was here all along.
andy_bernard No way!
walter_bernard_jr Jr. Way!
andy_bernard Erin I gotta go! Them's my chords!
pete_miller Hey. She's back.
erin_hannon Thanks for covering the phones.
pete_miller Yeah, no problem. How was it?
erin_hannon Fine.
pete_miller Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
erin_hannon Does he have a flipper?
pete_miller Oh. Nope. It's not that, he uh, uh he flipped a table one time when he was drunk.
erin_hannon He sounds like an idiot.
pete_miller Yeah, he is.
erin_hannon Ok.
pete_miller Ok.
erin_hannon Thanks.
pete_miller Yeah.
