dwight Hello, this is dwight Schrute. Hello?
jim Hello, this is Dwight.
dwight Hello? Hello?
jim Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second.
dwight Jim, what are you doing?
jim And how many would you like?
dwight Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
jim Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
dwight This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not dwight Schrute!
jim dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
dwight K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
jim Hello, this is Dwight.
pam Hey, is this Dwight?
jim Yes it is.
pam Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.
jim Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
dwight Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
pam Have you?
dwight Pam! You are not talking to dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
pam Dwight?
dwight No! Pam, I'm over here!
pam I'm confused.
dwight Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
jim Can't do that. Unsanitary.
dwight Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. Done.
jim This is Dwight.
jim Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
jim Oh, hello Mater. Good
news I've married. Tell Fater. Such a nice woman.
dwight Argh! Ahh!!
michael Today is toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy. There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
toby Morning.
michael Mornin'. So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm. And.
toby Good morning, Kelly.
kelly I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
toby Fine. Good.
kelly I feel weird.
michael First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.
angela We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
michael Okay.
angela But so far we only have two pictures of him.
michael Okay, well, this will not do. toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets.
pam Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw toby a New Orleans' funeral?
michael If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
angela Michael.
michael Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
angela No. You know-no!
michael Toga!
angela You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides. although toby won't be in them.
michael I thought that you might say that.
michael Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year. uh, as Nana starts to. but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle. " So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
michael I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this. ugly weight holding me down, you know?. I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
pam So how much antigravity potion do you want?
angela No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
michael Phyllis, can you do this?
phyllis Yes.
pam Hi, can I help you?
holly Hi. Yes, uh, I'm holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
toby As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
toby So this is H. R. This is your desk.
holly I love the view.
toby Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
pam Hey.
jim Hey. What?
pam Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
jim No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
pam Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
jim Yes! So when do you start?
pam I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
jim Wow. Busy morning.
pam So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months.
jim It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
pam Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.
jim See how easy that is?
pam Ohh.
pam I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect. And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here!
toby Hey, Stanley.
stanley Hmm?
toby I want to introduce you to.
michael Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
dwight So what do we know about her?
michael Well, we know that toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
dwight I hate her too.
michael Why do you hate her?
dwight Because she. stinks. with her. ways. and her. head.
michael You know, Dwight, sometimes. I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
dwight Would that be such a bad thing?
michael Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
dwight What?
michael We need to sell her an elevator pass.
dwight But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa.
michael Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
phyllis Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines? Woman over
speakerphone Antigravity machines?
phyllis That's right. Yeah. Woman over
speakerphone What do they do exactly?
phyllis They make you feel lighter. Woman over
speakerphone Antigravity. Um. Anti. depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.
phyllis Okay.
michael Yeah.
toby Hey Michael.
michael Oh, hey, do you still work here?
toby I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
michael Nah.
toby Come on.
michael No. I think I will pass.
toby michael Scott, this is Holly.
holly Hi.
michael Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work
here my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler
alert I'm gonna win.
holly Man, someone doesn't like H. R.
michael Yeah.
holly What did you do to him?
toby Nothing.
michael T-No. He tortured me. with his awfulness.
holly Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
michael Y-You can-Michael.
michael Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E. T. Is holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.
creed The pleasure's all mine.
holly Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
creed Any time.
holly What do you do here?
creed . Excuse me.
creed What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. "What do I do?". Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. "Qua" something, uh. qua. quar. quibo, qual. quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
dwight Have you been introduced to Kevin?
holly No. Which one's Kevin?
dwight He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
holly Oh. Good for you guys.
dwight Yeah.
dwight Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
dwight Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin.
holly Hello. Hello. Hi.
kevin Hi.
holly What do you do?
kevin I do the numbers.
holly Oh, good for you.
kevin Do you want a M&amp;M?
holly Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
kevin Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
holly Well that is a very safe place for them.
kevin Yeah.
michael Here she is! Holly. You know, if we hung holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
holly Oh. Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
michael I bet.
holly That's good.
michael I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
holly No, no, I.
michael Oh. What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
holly Ooh, uh.
michael You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
holly Um. Y-yeah. Okay.
michael All right.
holly Thanks.
michael Yep.
holly Great.
pam Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
toby You're-you're not in it.
pam Well I was taking the picture.
toby I love it. I love it. I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
pam Sure, do you have a camera here?
toby No, uh. Does anyone have a camera here? No one has a camera here. Uh.
pam Okay.
toby I'm gonna. I'll go get one. Stay.
jim So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
ryan Congratulations!
jim Thanks.
ryan Don't interrupt.
jim I just-
ryan Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
jim No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so.
ryan All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
jim All right, well it already went through, so.
ryan Don't worry about that. Just re-log it.
jim Hello?
michael Hmm. Jim? I am downloading some N3P.
jim That's not it.
michael Music.
jim Yeah.
michael For a CD mix tape.
jim Close.
michael For Holly.
jim Mmhmm.
michael And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
jim What are the two levels?
michael The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton".
jim Mmhmm.
michael And "I. love you. "
jim Okay. Let's start with the "I love you" level.
michael Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
jim Yes. You don't love Holly.
michael I think I do.
jim But you just met her.
michael Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
jim Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
michael Well, you're not a romantic.
jim Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
michael Oh really?
jim Yeah.
michael Like, with who?
jim We've been through this.
michael Pam?
jim Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
michael Yeah, you took it too slow.
jim Well, we're really happy.
michael This thing with holly feels a lot like love to me.
jim And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
michael I don't want her to get away.
jim I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and. Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
jim I was thinking. fireworks for the party. What do you think?
phyllis Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't.
jim Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
phyllis Why would you do that?
jim Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go.
phyllis Really?
jim Well we all want a good party, right?
jim I'm going to propose tonight. holy crap!
holly Hey Kevin.
kevin Hi.
holly Do you need some help?
kevin I can't decide what to get.
holly Well, what do you like to eat?
kevin Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
holly Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? Okay, let's see. fifty. Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
kevin Hmm.
kevin I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
jim Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere.
holly Damn it!
michael Hello, Holly. Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
holly Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and. that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that. is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
michael And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works. " So, I have no idea how you, how you sit like that.
holly Yoga.
michael Sit on floor and put together chair we will. Yo-da. Um.
holly Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
michael So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not. I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
holly Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
michael Kidding. Acting!
holly Acting!
michael Acting!
holly Lovitz.
michael Yeah.
michael I did it!
jim What'd you do?
michael I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know. not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
jim Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
michael It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
jim Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
michael Whew, oh God. Laying a base. Laying a base.
jim There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?. Hey. Hey!
michael Yeah. . push;
phyllis Hello Angela.
angela Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
phyllis Can I get a list of your vendors?
angela I shredded it.
phyllis Why would you do that?
angela Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
phyllis Sorry.
toby What'd you guys do?
michael Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
toby Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
michael Yes we do.
michael I'll let you in on a little
secret I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.
toby Wow, thanks, Michael, I.
michael Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
holly Hello.
michael Hey! Hi, good to see you.
holly You too.
michael I'm just having a little exit interview.
holly Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
michael Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
holly No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
michael Okay.
pam Did you need me to take notes?
toby Hi Pam. Stay.
pam Okay.
michael Um. Alright, well then, I will proceed. I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um. Who do you think you are?
toby I'm Toby.
michael Yeah. Correct. Um. What gives-what-what gives you the right?
holly Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
michael Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
holly Here you go.
michael Thank you. What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
toby This place, um.
michael Well, no no no no no.
toby I've got some ideas, I guess.
michael No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
holly Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
toby Well let me see. I would, uh.
michael I'll kill you.
toby I guess everything's okay.
toby I made it this far, right? What's the point?
pam Toby, why don't you open your present?
michael Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think. that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which.
toby "Suck on this. "
michael What the hell is that?
pam Michael.
michael That's. What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
dwight You did.
michael No!
dwight You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just-
michael Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is. a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
pam So what is your gift?
michael My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
pam What is it?
michael I am going to give Toby.
pam Your watch?
michael . Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
pam I just knew.
michael How did you know?
holly Oh that is so sweet.
michael Well. That's my watch.
toby Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
michael Hey, that's good.
creed Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! Hey! It's the temp! Look!
dwight Oh my gosh.
creed It's the temp!
pam Is that the police?
dwight Yes.
creed Mm-hmm.
oscar Well this is what
happened uh, Ryan's big project was the website. which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them
twice once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as "misleading the shareholders. " Another good term is "fraud. " The real crime, I think, was the beard.
michael Oh my God. Ryan. Oh my God.
kelly I cannot wait to visit ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan. " And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison. "
jim Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
pam Absolutely.
jim Right to voicemail. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck!
holly What's protocol on this?
toby I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't-
holly Michael, are you okay?
michael I'm just worried about my friend.
holly Oh, of course you are.
michael Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
holly No, hey.
michael I'm cool.
holly Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?.
michael holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.
kevin Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
phyllis Kevin, take your shoes off first!
michael No antigravity machine, huh?
phyllis Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
michael Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
pam Wow. Look at our parking lot.
jim Yeah, who'd have thought?
pam Is jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not. Is he?
holly Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
michael That's what she. a lot of places are like that.
holly I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
michael Thanks.
dwight You have it?
meredith Almost.
dwight Okay, here we go. Here we go. Put it in.
michael I like, uh.
holly That-That's my car.
michael Hey. What are you doing?
dwight Mose!
michael What the hell is going on here?!
dwight N-nothing you need to know the details of.
michael There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
dwight N-no there's not.
michael Why did you do that?
dwight It was playful hazing.
michael No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. Take care of that, all right?
dwight It's not rabid.
michael Shh.
meredith Thanks for bringing that up.
dwight Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
michael I'm really sorry.
holly Michael, thank you so much for saying that. I feel so welcome here.
michael Yeah.
holly I just. Um, excuse me.
michael Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what. wow-wee! Uh, well, jan didn't believe in showing affection, so. sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh. I like it! Vance Refrigeration
guy Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!
phyllis Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. Okay.
holly Cool! You drive your own car?
kevin Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
holly Yep. Just like you.
kevin Okay, bye.
holly Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
michael Alright! Let's hear it for darryl and his band. You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
pam Yay, Phyllis!
michael Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
pam Song parody writer.
michael I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven. "
jim Classic.
michael Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart. "
jim Not my favorite, but.
pam I like that one.
jim It's not my favorite.
pam I like that one.
michael I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?
darryl Yeah.
michael It was early morning yesterday. I was up before the dawn. and I really have enjoyed my stay. toby must be movin' on.
pam I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
michael Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise.
pam Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
michael Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
holly Not bad.
michael Oh, hey. Thanks.
holly Someday I would love to hear "Beers in Heaven. "
michael Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. Sorry. Kevin. Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
kevin Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
michael Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
kevin No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
michael What is it?
kevin Just hurry.
holly Is he okay?
michael Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
holly Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket. it's a big day for him.
michael Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
jan Well it was good to see you.
kevin It was great to see you, Jan.
jan Yeah, so.
michael O-kay. Hello Jan.
jan Hello. Michael.
michael Wow, Kevin, really? We're- Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. Is this why you called me down here?
kevin Yeah, Michael, I just uh.
jan I.
kevin I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
michael Oh, okay.
kevin Yeah.
michael Thanks, Kevin. Um.
michael Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! Are you nauseous?
jan No.
michael Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
jan Uh, no.
michael Good. Good. Thank God.
jan I didn't.
michael Cause that's.
jan . touch that.
michael Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy.
jan Why?
michael Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very.
jan Yeah, it did.
michael . proud.
jan . happen when.
michael Um.
jan . we were together. That's true. And-but, you. are not. uh, you're not the dad.
michael You cheated on me. when I specifically asked you not to?
jan . Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not.
michael Well, okay.
jan Yeah.
michael So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so. I know. the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so.
jan I went to a sperm bank.
michael You did?
jan Yuh-huh.
michael When we were going out?
jan Uh, yeah.
michael W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious. I'd wear two condoms.
jan I know.
michael You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
jan No, no no. it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really. this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's. and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
michael IHop.
jan IHop.
jan If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
jan Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
michael I'm glad you told me.
jan Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um. you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner.
michael Um, I'll. I have to think about it.
jan Okay.
michael My whole life, I have known two
things I love s*x, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
pam Oh look, they're starting.
angela Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
jim Hey.
