michael Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
dwight Michael?
michael Yes?
dwight I've got a treat for you!
michael Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
dwight Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
michael Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
dwight That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Hah!
michael Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
dwight What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
michael I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? The job was not mine to give. Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
dwight Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
michael Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket.
dwight Great idea.
michael . in order to feed the bears.
dwight Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
michael How do you mean?
dwight Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? You're like a giant walking salami!
michael Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
dwight Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
michael Okay.
deangelo You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
michael Hm?
deangelo I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
michael Well I have interviews.
deangelo That's nice. How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might. glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. You okay?
michael Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
deangelo You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
michael Oh you don't, that's-
deangelo I will be in the break room.
michael That sounds good. Thank you.
deangelo Dead man walking.
michael Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so. Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
gabe Stay away from Erin!
andy Hey!
gabe I'm your boss!
andy Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
gabe No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
andy Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
gabe No! You go away!
andy Hi Tuna.
jim So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
phyllis How about cupcakes?
angela Please.
pam What's wrong with cupcakes?
angela Everything.
michael There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
pam Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
pam We thought.
angela It's an experiment.
phyllis The three of us have all been chairmen before.
pam So this is the dream team.
meredith Hey! What are you saying?!
angela The dream team. and Meredith.
meredith We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
michael Mmm!
phyllis Yeah that was a surprise.
michael You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
pam Okay.
michael Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
pam Should we get toppings?
michael What do you like Pam?
pam What?
michael What kind of toppings would you like?
pam Hot fudge?
michael Sounds good. Fudge it up!
michael I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. I still need something to drink out of though.
michael Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
phyllis Please Michael.
michael When phyllis was in high school, she was so. cute. And she still is.
phyllis I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
phyllis Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
michael Ahh.
phyllis It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
michael Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind.
phyllis It's cute.
michael Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
stanley Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
michael Well, okay. And Andy, andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.
andy Wow.
stanley Yeah wow!
andy You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
michael But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
phyllis What does that even mean?
michael You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
andy I'm gonna lose 'em.
michael You're not gonna lose them.
andy I promise you that I will.
michael Just do your best! I have faith in you.
stanley Gimme those clients!
andy No.
phyllis Do you believe that?!
dwight I've given up expecting michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
deangelo I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it.
michael Kevin, I have something for you.
kevin Oh!
michael You know who that is?
kevin Oh.
michael Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
kevin Better.
michael Good, stand up. You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
kevin But.
michael You will find love.
kevin Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
michael Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
andy I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
michael Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this.
oscar Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
michael It looks like a It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
michael Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have s*x at some point?
angela It was just you.
michael How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
oscar State Senator.
michael Mmhmm, bravo!
oscar Brava!
angela You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
michael Sure!
angela Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
michael Who's that? Who's that guy?
angela Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
michael I guess this could be the one, huh?
angela Yeah.
andy Hey.
deangelo Hey!
andy I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
deangelo Let's rip it up homes.
gabe Walk away bitch.
oscar Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
michael My last pay check?
oscar You have an address yet in Colorado?
michael No.
oscar What town do Holly's parents live in?
michael I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
kevin Sounds beautiful!
pam You should do more stuff like that.
kevin I'm going to!
jim Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
michael Nah, I'm almost done.
jim You sure?
michael Yeah.
pam So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
kevin Finally! That old shredder sucked.
pam It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
kevin Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
pam It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
kevin I know.
jim Did you break the shredder Kevin?
kevin No, it's just. that old shredder sucks. Just get one that'll shred magazines.
pam I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
michael I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come.
holly Hello there!
michael Hi. What is the name of our town?
holly Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
michael No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
holly Oh you mean this?
michael Yes. Yes my hero!
holly I'll pay the rent! Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
michael Ohh, I miss you.
holly Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
michael Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
holly I love you too.
michael Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. And I have said goodbye to half of them.
toby Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
michael Okay.
toby Okay.
michael Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
kelly What?!
michael If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
kelly Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice. . push;
michael She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
ryan Wow.
michael Yeah.
ryan This is. totally unnecessary.
michael You're not prone to seizures?
ryan No.
pam So michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
meredith Erotic.
angela See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
phyllis Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes.
meredith I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
angela Good God.
meredith They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
pam I don't, I don't think we sh-
meredith I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
pam Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
phyllis As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
pam You know what, I think we should get some other input.
kelly I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
phyllis Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
angela No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
michael Um, Pam.
pam Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
michael Okay.
erin Gabe!
gabe I need to talk to you!
erin You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
abe Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes.
erin Hey Creed.
creed Not cool man.
erin I really think you should leave.
gabe Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
erin Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
gabe Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one.
erin Gabe!
gabe Okay.
toby Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
rory I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him.
toby Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
rory Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.
toby Well, no. He hates jams.
michael Darryl!
darryl Hey.
michael I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
darryl That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
michael Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
darryl No. Can't let you do that Mike.
michael No problem. Worth a try.
michael darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving. Warehouse
guy No.
michael Alright guys, well. see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip.
deangelo okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? Hmm?
andy I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
deangelo That's stupid.
andy What do I know?
deangelo What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
andy Yeah.
deangelo Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
andy Yeah!
deangelo 'Cause if you do now's the time.
andy Alright.
deangelo Not while I'm driving.
michael Catch you guys- Catch you guys on the filippity flip. Flippity flip! Flippity flip! Really? Okay, see ya guys!
deangelo You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
andy No. I don't.
deangelo I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.
andy Awwhh, wow.
deangelo Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! Yeah! Again.
andy Oh, okay.
deangelo Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! You hear me?! You feel that energy?
andy Mmhmmm.
deagnelo Wooo! Yeah! Okay, again.
erin I know that gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I. I just think I'm in love with someone else.
michael Kevin?
erin Andy.
michael Ahhhh.
erin I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
michael Maybe neither.
erin I'm not attracted to Kevin.
michael Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
erin Extension 147.

erin I know.
michael Okay.
phyllis You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
michael Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
phyllis No. I'm on a sale!
michael Listen to me. It's two p. m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
phyllis Okay.
michael Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow.
dwight Yes.
michael So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation.
dwight This is gonna be good. To whom it may concern. Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. The dictionary defines superlative
as of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. I define it as dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. Ohhh, yeah.
dwight 
michael 
deangelo I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. But I can say
this He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always
say go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, Andy's not your guy. You ever play Russian Roulette? Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year.
jim Ahh, what happened to you?
michael You should see the other guy.
dwight 
michael jim where is Pam?
jim Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
michael But it is already three o'clock!
pam 
michael Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
michael Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
michael And you, why are you still here.
gabe I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
michael No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite.
deangelo That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
andy Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
deangelo Okay whatever.
andy Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
client Keep talking.
deangelo Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. You'll never guess, we did it!
andy Hey! Good job boss!
deangelo We did it!
michael Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this!
stanley Yes, what is this about?
michael What is this meeting about?
stanley Mmhmmm.
michael Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. And secondly, phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
phyllis They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
michael Well power through the arthritis phyllis you can do it!
stanley Is that it?
michael Umm, hmm?
stanley Is that it?
michael Ummm. Hm. No. No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
jim Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
michael Sure. Be right out!
jim So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
michael Ohh.
jim What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
michael Okay.
jim You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
michael Maybe.
jim Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
michael Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
jim Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes. goodbyes are a bitch.
michael T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. You started with this company, as a fine young man.
jim You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
michael Oh, okay.
jim And then tomorrow, I can tell you. what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had.
michael Oh shoot! That's my cab.
jim Alright.
michael Alright.
jim Listen Michael, I really. I did text Pam, but.
michael I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
jim I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
michael I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
jim You got it.
michael Okay. Phyllis.
phyllis Oh no, they're still not done.
michael No no no, let me see. Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em.
creed See ya tomorrow boss!
michael Later guys.
michael Got almost everybody. So. Holly's my family now. She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just. when you get down to it. your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
michael Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright. Oh! This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. That's what she said!
pam No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
deangelo Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. I for one love the corners. Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. What am I doing? Come on DeAngelo!
dwight Uh oh.
