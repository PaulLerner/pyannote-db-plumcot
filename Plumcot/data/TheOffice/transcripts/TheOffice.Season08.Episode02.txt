jim_halpert Hey, so this isn't matching up with this...and I'm not sure which one's right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
kevin_malone Yes. Me do.
jim_halpert Alright.
jim_halpert Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
kevin_malone Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.
pam_beesly Kevin, do you feel OK?
kevin_malone Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.
pam_beesly Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
jim_halpert Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?
oscar_martinez No, guys.
angela_martin No, he's fine.
oscar_martinez He's fine.
angela_martin He's always been like that.
pam_beesly No he hasn't.
angela_martin I mean, he's gotten worse over the years....
oscar_martinez He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
kevin_malone You keep think that.
kevin_malone Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say "car no go", and we best friends. So me think why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
andy_bernard Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do.
kevin_malone Thank.
andy_bernard Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is...basically the speech equivalent... to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use...but need need for talk talk.
kevin_malone But save time. More success.
jim_halpert Does it save time though? ‘Cause we've been here for about an hour.
kevin_malone No me fault.
pam_beesly Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time.
kevin_malone Many small time make big time.
andy_bernard What are you gonna do with all this time?
kevin_malone See world.
pam_beesly Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
jim_halpert K, Kevin, are you saying "See the world"? or "Sea World?"
kevin_malone See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.
jim_halpert No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don't know if you're saying "Sea World" or "see the world," and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.
kevin_malone Fine, fine. I'll talk normally.
kevin_malone When me President, they see. They see.
dwight_schrute This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet....the Pyramid.
phyllis_vance Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
dwight_schrute So, you can tell your clients "Unleash the power of the pyramid."
pam_beesly It's huge. How much does it weigh?
dwight_schrute Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds.
ryan_howard How much memory does it have without the booster?
dwight_schrute Fifty L.
ryan_howard I'm sorry," L"?
jim_halpert How many L to a K?
dwight_schrute You're really going to want the booster.
stanley_hudson How on earth are we supposed to sell...?
jim_halpert I'll take five.
phyllis_vance Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing.
andy_bernard Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
andy_bernard I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties...and tie clips. Which combo do you think Robert is going to like more? What do you think, C-SPAN?
oscar_martinez ..."C-SPAN"?
andy_bernard Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause......
dwight_schrute Is this really the best use of our collective time?
andy_bernard I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog...had to pull rank.
dwight_schrute OK, let's look at some ties.
dwight_schrute Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise.
dwight_schrute Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
erin_hannon Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
pam_beesly Erin, you don't need to call him that.
erin_hannon Andy wants us to, P-Dog.
darryl_philbin It's ok E-Dog, just who called?
erin_hannon Justine. She said she's coming by later.
jim_halpert Your ex-wife?
kevin_malone Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
darryl_philbin No no no no. I like her.
kevin_malone Well I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman.
darryl_philbin Nah man, we get along now. Real well.
jim_halpert Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her.
darryl_philbin I'll introduce you.
darryl_philbin Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex wife last night.... I have to sing it. We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
andy_bernard Hi Dad!...... Ahhh....oh boy.
robert_california Hello, Andy. Excellent tie.
erin_hannon Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here?
robert_california I'd love some coffee.
robert_california I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.
andy_bernard Are you factoring in the... whole national ...economy.... declining and all that?
robert_california Andy, do you know why I chose you?
andy_bernard I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor....vanilla?
robert_california Vanilla? No no no no. You'll never guess in a million billion years you'll never guess.
andy_bernard You were saying you chose me.... There was a reason?
robert_california Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?
andy_bernard Can I inspire? I don't know!.....I don't know.
robert_california Oh! Thank you. Uh....
erin_hannon Oh, sorry.
robert_california You can just put it down.
erin_hannon Oh
robert_california That is very cold.
erin_hannon Yeah. It's old.
robert_california Why would I.....?
erin_hannon I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said "coffee"....
andy_bernard Why don't we get Robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
erin_hannon Andy, you don't want that.
andy_bernard I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. Mmm....
erin_hannon Sorry.
robert_california You like her.
andy_bernard I do.
robert_california She likes you.
andy_bernard You know, we've both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance....
robert_california I'm afraid you've lost my interest.
oscar_martinez Let me call you back.
meredith_palmer I gotta go.
robert_california If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?
robert_california Ah...
kevin_malone This is where we go
robert_california Oh, you'd go someplace else. That's not it, that's not the answer.
kevin_malone It's a answer.
robert_california It's a wrong answer.
kevin_malone There are no wrong answers.
robert_california Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it's birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?
phyllis_vance Wait....they're terrified?
robert_california Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them "you are welcome." Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.
andy_bernard You got it.
robert_california Double.
andy_bernard Done.
robert_california I'm not kidding.
andy_bernard Neither am I, it's already done. Hah, I'm just kidding, it's going to take some time.
robert_california Double.
jim_halpert Hey.
andy_bernard What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business...see how things are going? Ahem...
jim_halpert Why don't you start?
andy_bernard If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert...man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling ...project going?
phyllis_vance Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button.
andy_bernard OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.
stanley_hudson If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense.
jim_halpert He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
andy_bernard Dwight, anything?
dwight_schrute We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.
andy_bernard You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? Tuna.
jim_halpert New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door...
andy_bernard Fart..... good Sesh. That leg's asleep.
justine Hello. I'm looking for Darryl Philbin?
kevin_malone Don't! oh, you must think...I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an Erin here.
justine Ok....?
kevin_malone So...DARRYL! A GIRL!
darryl_philbin rub a dub dub...I got scrubbed. ‘Sup, darlin'? Everybody, this is Justine. This is Jim and Oscar, everybody.
meredith_palmer Hi.
kevin_malone Kevin.
justine Can we.... go some place private?
darryl_philbin Follow me, I got a space. After you. I've been thinking about you all mornin'. I don't know what you did, I can barely walk today.
andy_bernard D-Bone. There you are.
dwight_schrute Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?
andy_bernard No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about...
dwight_schrute Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.
andy_bernard I know, right?
dwight_schrute Right?
andy_bernard Yeah...um, how is everything?
dwight_schrute Good. Really really good.
andy_bernard Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
dwight_schrute Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
andy_bernard Oof. What are you gonna do about that?
dwight_schrute I don't know, what do you mean?
andy_bernard There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...
dwight_schrute You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! And I'll do mine..... walnuts?
kevin_malone No!
angela_martin Have you seen this?
pam_beesly Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
jim_halpert She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces.
angela_martin Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
pam_beesly I flipped through it.
angela_martin So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant?
pam_beesly Of course.
jim_halpert We know that.
pam_beesly Yeah.
angela_martin I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?
pam_beesly That sounds nice.
angela_martin Great.
jim_halpert You have a walking buddy.
pam_beesly I do.
andy_bernard Thanks for coming in guys.
phyllis_vance You don't have to thank us for coming in, it's our job.
andy_bernard Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I'm gonna thank people.
meredith_palmer What's with the blanket?
andy_bernard This is what's under the blanket.
oscar_martinez We don't get it.
andy_bernard These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves "Well, how does this work?"
pam_beesly Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
andy_bernard You're exactly right and you get a point.
pam_beesly Oh.
ryan_howard Uh, is that a vibrator?
andy_bernard Twenty points.
meredith_palmer How does one get a point?
andy_bernard I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
kelly_kapoor Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross.
andy_bernard There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
stanley_hudson How ‘bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
andy_bernard I can't.
kelly_kapoor This point system is really insulting.
andy_bernard Ooh I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me because I am very very... Sari. Sixteen points.
kelly_kapoor That's a tablecloth.
jim_halpert What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
andy_bernard That's a crazy amount of points.
jim_halpert But, what if?
andy_bernard Well, what do you want?
jim_halpert I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy.
andy_bernard Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work.
jim_halpert That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?
andy_bernard I'll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard!
all@ Ooooh!
oscar_martinez Really?
jim_halpert Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
andy_bernard Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work!
jim_halpert Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
pam_beesly Yeah! Whoo!
jim_halpert I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much. Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
phyllis_vance Ask for Donald, Karen's bananas.
jim_halpert Ok.
andy_bernard T-bag bone...
jim_halpert Andrew.
andy_bernard Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
jim_halpert No, I didn't notice anything.
andy_bernard Really? Because I sat next to Stanley for years....and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.
stanley_hudson You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
jim_halpert I don't know what to tell you, man.
andy_bernard You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
jim_halpert Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
andy_bernard Bah...I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
jim_halpert Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.
andy_bernard Hundred and twenty points.
jim_halpert Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though... Hey! Yes, this is Jim Halpert calling for Donald...can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.
pam_beesly Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's?
erin_hannon Yes!
jim_halpert and I'm back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
pam_beesly Where's Angela?
andy_bernard Hey Kevin, what are you doing?
kevin_malone Don't talk to me!
andy_bernard Hi, Professor Frank, Andy Bernard, class of '95. Hey there, um, I'm a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here...De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale...uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I'm in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations.
andy_bernard Took ‘em one day.
pam_beesly Ready! "I'm not as think as you drunk I am!"
ryan_howard I like it, I like it!
pam_beesly Do Not Resuscitate...
andy_bernard OK, keep in mind, it's not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car for a thousand points....or best offer.
phyllis_vance What else you got?
pam_beesly Oh, and then this was Phyllis's idea... So nasty Phyllis!
pam_beesly We were hoping you could do something like this...
tattoo_artist Artist So, coming out of his butt is a...
pam_beesly Baby.
tattoo_artist Artist Baby...
pam_beesly Yes.
tattoo_artist Artist Yeah, no problem.
andy_bernard We should think about this...does anyone have any better ideas?
stanley_hudson I like what we have.
meredith_palmer Looks good.
erin_hannon Yeah.
kevin_malone For sure.
andy_bernard Just need a second outside.
jim_halpert Gettin' psyched up?
andy_bernard Yeah.
jim_halpert Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this...
andy_bernard Tunes..what am I doing here? Why did Robert pick me? ....Confession I don't know what I'm doing.
jim_halpert I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun....and you did that.
andy_bernard My ass is only so big, I mean I can't do this everyday.
jim_halpert But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea....which, by the way, I can't wait for.
andy_bernard No one expects me to go through with this, right?
jim_halpert Absolutely not.
andy_bernard Let's ink...my stink!
andy_bernard My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
all@ Whoa!
andy_bernard Do your worst!
tattoo_artist Artist Uh, you can keep your pants on actually...if just drop ‘em down a bit, that'd be great.
andy_bernard They are already off, my good sir.
tattoo_artist Artist I'd really prefer they not be down.
andy_bernard Well, I think down's better. Sweating pretty heavily down there.
pam_beesly Do you think you could work from this? we made some small adjustments.
tattoo_artist Artist OK, you want me to...
pam_beesly Just a few adjustments
tattoo_artist Artist Alright, let's begin.
andy_bernard This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
tattoo_artist Artist That was just the cotton swab.
andy_bernard Invest in softer cotton, sir. OW! Oh! Oooh! oh, whoa!!
dwight_schrute Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it.
dwight_schrute DRAW SOME BLOOD!
andy_bernard AHHHHH!!!!!!!
robert_california Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
andy_bernard It's a Nard Dog! That's my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
jim_halpert Pull up your pants.
robert_california There's something about an underdog that really inspires...the unexceptional.
pam_beesly Um, what should we talk about?
angela_martin Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I'm having.
pam_beesly Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
angela_martin A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don't know if I should call social services about it.
pam_beesly Angela, that's pretty transparently me.
angela_martin Maybe.
pam_beesly You know it's just herbal tea.
angela_martin In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
pam_beesly Yeah. I think you should call social services.
angela_martin I already did.
pam_beesly You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together.
angela_martin Fine.
pam_beesly Fine.
