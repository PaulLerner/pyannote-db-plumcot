ryan Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie.
jim No. They're in the conference room.
ryan Good.
pam Wait, are those Michael's Levis?
ryan Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
pam michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
pam I'll take those. Thanks.
jan This is a projection of the county's needs.
michael Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today.
jan Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals.
jim So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. Years.
jan So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
michael I changed it. To Chili's.
jan Excuse me?
michael Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson". It's kind of snooty. So.
jan You had no right to do that, Michael.
michael Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.
jan It said that.
michael It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.
jan Alright. But you will let me run this meeting.
michael Uh huh, uh huh. Power trip.
jan What?
oscar She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
jim No.
oscar Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
toby That is unbelievable.
pam What is going on?
jim We are doing worst first dates.
pam Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
oscar Ok, that's a joke.
pam No, they had to come back for me.
jim Wait, when was this?
pam Umm. it was not that long ago.
kelly Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance.
jim I always knew pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting.
michael Ok, let's do this thing. Wish us luck.
dwight Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
jan Thank you.
michael Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.
jan Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.
michael Well.
jan Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
michael No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. Adios!
jan So which way is Chili's?
michael Uh, I'll drive.
jan Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there.
michael It's just a couple blocks away, so. boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
jan I know Scranton.
michael At all!
jan Alright.
michael You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
jan If it's a couple blocks away-
michael Dar de dar.
jan Ok.
michael jan Levinson-Gould. jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.
michael We should come up with a signal of some sort.
jan Why would we need a signal?
michael Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
jan What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
michael Well, I. it could be either of us.
jan You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
michael Yeees.
michael Hello? Christian?
christian Yes.
michael Thought that was you. Hi. michael Scott. This is jan Levinson-Gould.
jan Just jan Levinson.
michael No Gould?
jan No. Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long?
christian No, not long.
michael Uh, Jan, what happened?
jan Michael.
michael Is Gould dead? What uh-
jan Michael, we got divorced, ok? I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
michael Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?
jan Michael. Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
michael When did this happen?
jan We're in a meeting.
michael Ok.
hostess This way, please.
jan Christian.
michael Alright, after you.
christian Thank you.
michael 
jan I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
christian Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-
michael Awesome blossom.
jan What?
michael I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
christian Sure.
michael Ok, it's done. Actually, Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done.
jan So-
michael I heard a-
jan If you have a-
michael Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?
jan Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
christian It's ok, I like jokes.
michael Ok.
jan Just the one.
michael Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm. let's see. choo choo choo.
pam Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
pam Ok, you want me to read 'em?
michael Yes.
pam Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
michael No.
pam When-
michael Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.
pam Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship-
michael Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?
pam Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
jim Is this real?
pam It is a screenplay. Starring himself.
jim Agent michael Scarn.
pam Of the FBI.
jim How long is this? Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings.
pam What is that?
jim Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like.
michael First guy says "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn". And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort". And the third guy says "I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe".
christian Ohhh no! Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!
jan Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please? . push;
jim Do we all have our copy of "Threat
level Midnight", by michael Scott?
everyone Yeah, yeah.
jim Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
phyllis That's the character's name?
jim Oh yeah-
dwight Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
jim Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
dwight You took something that doesn't belong to you.
jim Dwight-
dwight Brought it in here-
jim Do you want to play-
dwight Made copies of it-
jim The lead role of Agent michael Scarn?
michael Yum! Yum yum yum! That's delicious! I love it!
jan We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
christian Well, we are out to save money.
jan What's the bottom line?
michael Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
michael That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault.
michael Did somebody say "baby back ribs"? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
jan I don't think christian has time for that.
christian I have time.
michael I want my baby back, baby back, baby back michael and
christian I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-
michael Chili's baby back ribs.
jim Inside the FBI, Agent michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
phyllis Sir, you have some messages.
dwight Not now!
phyllis They're important.
dwight Ok, what are they?
phyllis First message
is "I love you". That's from me.
dwight Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!
dwight Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.
dwight If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
ryan Agent michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
dwight Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission.
pam Hey, uh, I have to work late.
roy You're joking right?
jim michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
dwight Pow! Pow! Pow!
ryan Hahaha, Agent michael Scarn, you so funny. Word.
kevin Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. Heh.
jim A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to michael Scarn. Uh. Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
oscar Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
dwight Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage.
ryan I forget it, brutha.
dwight Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. Wait, who's Dwigt?
pam Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And dwight figured it out. Oops.
dwight D-W-I-G-H-T.
dwight Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end.
jim Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
dwight Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
jim That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. Hey, are you hungry?
pam Yeah.
jim Yeah?
christian So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her.
michael Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
jan Oh no, Michael, Michael, please. No, really.
michael Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing.
christian It's not fair.
michael She's not playing the game.
jan We'd been fighting for a while-
michael Check please.
jan He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did. I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
christian You didn't.
jan I was stupid. michael and
christian No.
michael No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?
christian That's right.
michael You know?
christian You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.
michael It's true.
christian You said "World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!"
jim I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
jim Wow.
pam For the bugs.
jim Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
pam Yes. nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
christian Right down the street?
michael Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
christian I know.
michael It's bad.
christian It's terrible.
michael It, you know what, it really is.
jan Uh-
christian I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts.
michael Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
jim So, I guess I'll see you in ten hours.
pam What are you going to do with your time off?
jim Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be. really nice. Gonna find myself.
pam You have new music?
jim Yeah. Definitely.
michael See ya.
jan Bye. thanks. Yes!
michael We did it!
jan We got it!
michael Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.
jan I am really- Thrilled. Let's go.
michael What!?
jan Let's go.
michael Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. Oh-ok.
dwight Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan?
michael Morning, Pam. Hey.
michael No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So.
michael Hello, Dwight.
dwight Did you do her?
michael Who.
dwight jan Levinson-Gould.
michael Uh, no, no, no Gould.
dwight Did you do her?
michael This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
dwight And she is your boss.
michael And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all?
jim jan didn't come back for her car last night.
pam What!?
jim Could it be that Agent michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
pam Oh, I don't know. Oh my God. This is Jan's cell.
jim No way.
pam Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My
question do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. Would you excuse me? No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk Excuse me? Excuse me?! I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!
jim Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
pam Oh, really?
jim Really.
pam Why might some say that?
jim Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
pam Uh hmm.
jim Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date.
pam We didn't dance.
jim You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic.
pam Swaying isn't dancing.
jim Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
pam I have some faxes to get out.
jim Oh, come on, Pam. I-
jim Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?
