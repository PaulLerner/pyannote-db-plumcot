man Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting.
dwight Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
jim Oh.
dwight This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
dwight Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
jim I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
dwight No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha. screw you!
man Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence.
dwight What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? Dwight, don't be bothered by the . Over the line, Jim.

jim Smart.
dwight And the rest was just stuff.

jim Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
michael January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.
michael Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
michael Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.
erin Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry.
michael Okay, so killing yourself. I was just thinking about snot.
angela Good morning.
pam Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on. da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
dwight Wow. Did your baby draw that?
angela The glitter is blinding.
phyllis I think it's good.
pam It's gonna be fun.

erin And did you get the tickets?
michael I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.
erin I'm really excited for michael either way. Because if holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
pam Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board.

andy The bookstore?
dwight It's that easy?
darryl I'll come with you, show you how it's done.

pam No.
michael But you did still love him.
pam I'm not. I'm not going to have.
michael Do you love him now?
pam No! Just talk to her.
michael No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
phyllis I'll talk to her, Michael.
michael You think she'd talk to you?
phyllis Why wouldn't she?
michael That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring erin to balance you out?

dwight I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
darryl I got that cutie behind the counter. Bookstore
employee Well, if you read a lot, you should check out our e-readers. They're really neat.

holly Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went. and, we're still together.
phyllis You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
holly It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
darryl Whoa! Hold on.
dwight I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
darryl Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
dwight Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
darryl I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
dwight Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
andy Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.

gabe Intercepted!
erin Hey! Gabe.
gabe Whoops.
pam Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
creed I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
pam How is it going?
creed I'm having a little trouble motivating.
pam One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
michael Or sooner.
pam Yeah.
michael That's not a joke.
pam But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
kevin Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
pam Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
michael Is it?
pam Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
michael Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12
 01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
kevin Well not all of us are michael Freaking Scott.
michael What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
creed Well, I can't, I don't know how.
michael You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.
creed My tombstone's already made, thank you.
michael Just do a cartwheel!
erin This is all I could find.
michael Eat it.
pam You don't have to do that, Kevin.
kevin I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
kelly Why are you eating stem first?
kevin This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
ryan The other way.
kevin Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
michael No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
pam Oh, Michael.
michael Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
kevin God, I hate it.

angela All right!
michael Eat it!
kelly You're killing him, Michael!
michael All right, all right, shh!
kevin All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
michael Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.

holly Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just. I don't want to talk about it.
michael Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
creed You think?
michael And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
kevin You were super mean.
michael It was insensitive and I am sorry.
kevin It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
michael I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies. I. care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
kevin Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
michael You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
creed I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.
kevin Well, I am.
michael Okay, oh! All right.
kevin I'm going to help you.
