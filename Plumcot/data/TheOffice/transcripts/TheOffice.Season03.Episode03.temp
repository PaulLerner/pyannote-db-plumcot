michael Ahhhhhhhhh. I'm hungry.
michael Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is. Varsity Blues!
michael Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
dwight Take a seat down there. Second from the end.
michael Alright, everybody here? Yes.
pam Popcorn anyone?
michael Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!
pam Anyone else? Nooo.
pam Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which michael made us watch six times.
michael Entourage!
michael Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
kevin Yes!
dwight Why him?
michael Don't whine. Get the window.
michael Previously on Varsity Blues.
kevin Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year.
jan Hello?
dwight Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.
angela I don't approve. I don't.
jan Hello?
michael Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
jan How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that?
michael People work faster after.
jan Magically?
michael No. they have to. to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
jan No.
angela Kitchen.
angela michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
dwight That's not going to happen.
angela You know she has it out for him now.
dwight That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!
dwight Ever since michael dumped jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.
angela Dwight, you should be running this office.
dwight michael would never let me.
angela It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
dwight I could never do that!
angela Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
angela I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
jim At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, pam called it. Pretendenitus.
pam Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.
pam kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um. just get new clothes.
pam Ok.
kelly I love it!
pam Really? I don't know.
kelly You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
pam Not at work, I'll try it on---
kelly Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!
pam . noooo
kelly Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!
andy Why did you do that?!
jim I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
andy We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish.
jim Wait, are we playing teams?
karen Yeah.
dwight WAH! GAH!
jan Hello?
dwight Is this Jan?
jan Who is this?
dwight This is dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
jan You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
dwight It's about Michael.
jan What about him?
dwight I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.
jan It's not about a surprise party is it?
dwight No, but we should discuss that another time.
jan Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
dwight Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
jan How do you know I like that store?
dwight Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
jan How do you know that?
dwight Part of my job.
jan No it's not. It's officially not.
dwight . noted.
dwight I'm going. to the dentist.
michael Ok.
dwight I have to have an emergency crown put in.
michael Ouchy.
dwight Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone. three hours.
michael Three hours, wow. Have fun.
dwight Did you get anything good?
jan Yeah.
dwight New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?
dwight I can save the branch.
jan Really?
dwight If you let me run it.
jan Ok.
dwight "Ok" I can run it?
jan What would you do differently?
dwight Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.
jan Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
dwight The decision to turn on michael was difficult. But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So , here we are. It's all, on the table. I want. the branch. And I await your decision.
dwight Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings.
jan Where is it?
jan Michael.
michael Hi.
jan I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
michael Oh. That's nice.
jan No, it wasn't. dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
michael . what?
jan Mm-hmm.
michael . you were at the dentist?
jan You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately.
michael Ok.
michael What was dwight thinking? That he could turn jan against me? She's my ex-lover! . ish.
phyllis Woooooow.
kelly It's so sexy. You look so hot.
phyllis It's really something.
pam It's too much.
kelly What?
pam I'm gonna return it.
kelly No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
roy Hey.
pam Hi.
roy You look nice.
pam Thanks.
kelly Isn't that like your third soda today?
jim Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company. Ok, see you next week. Bye. Again?
karen Scared?
karen Call of Duty! . push;
josh Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?
andy Now?
josh Yes now.
andy Put the game on hold everyone.
josh This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there.
andy It's the new guy.
jim Oh, I'm sorry I don't know. what we're talking about.
andy See what I mean?
josh We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the gun room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?
jim Um, sniper rifle?
josh SNIPE--
andy WHAT?
josh JIM!
andy Are you playing for the other team?!
josh You don't snipe in Carrington, ok?
andy Saboteur!
josh Andy, it's not---
andy Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you.
michael Hey Dwight.
dwight Hey.
michael Do you want an M&amp;M?
dwight No thanks I'm stuffed.
michael No seriously. You should have an M&amp;M, they're really good.
dwight . ok.
michael They're good, huh?
dwight . so good.
michael Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
dwight They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so.
michael Sounds like a good dentist.
dwight Oh, yeah.
michael What's his name?
dwight Crentist.
michael Your dentist's name is Crentist.
dwight Yep.
michael Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.
dwight Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
michael Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.
dwight Ahh. Aaaah.
michael You should. floss.
dwight I know.
michael Well then. I am glad you're ok.
michael Business is like a jungle. And I. am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology.
michael Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
michael Wow, this is tough.
dwight What?
michael Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!
dwight What is it?
michael Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um. she demoted me.
dwight No.
michael Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
dwight Gahh!
michael And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
dwight I can't believe this news. That--- wow.
michael I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it. because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.
dwight You said that?
michael Yep, I did. I did. But I think. you should do it.
dwight Well. Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will.
michael Perfect, well, we're settled.
dwight All right.
michael All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I. am assistant regional manager.
dwight Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it.
michael Ohh.
dwight Hey. I can't imagine this place without you.
michael Can't you? That's so nice.
michael Well. I guess we should go tell the troops.
dwight Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. Ok let's do it.
michael Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I. am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
phyllis You're kidding.
michael You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
angela Congratulations Dwight.
dwight Thank you Angela.
stanley But. why Dwight?
michael Because, Dwight. never lies.
stanley How does that qualify him to run a branch?
michael Because that's all it takes.
michael Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody. about loyalty?
dwight Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!
phyllis Michael, what will you do?
michael Oh, I'll be fine.
kevin Do you have any savings?
michael No, no, I don't, but---
kevin Michael, you might lose your condo.
michael I. won't. I won't.
pam I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
phyllis Maybe I'll quit.
angela It's really happening!
dwight Yes.
angela We can make a difference here.
dwight I, will, make a difference here.
angela You alone? Because I thought together we could---
dwight Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women.
karen Look how cute he is! He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
jim I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
karen I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
jim I'm trying---
karen Just tap S then D.
jim Oh.
karen Any. last words? No?
jim What?
jim Wow. Psychopath.
pam What?
creed I'm just looking.
pam Please go back to your desk.
creed In a minute.
pam Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
michael Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
dwight No thank you.
michael It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
dwight No thanks.
michael What?
dwight Not my style.
michael But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.
dwight Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
michael Take it back.
dwight No.
michael That's my car.
dwight What did you---
michael THAT'S MY CAR.
dwight Yes.
michael I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know.
dwight You know what?
michael jan called me about your little meeting!
dwight No!
michael I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
dwight I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.
michael Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?
dwight Don't fire me. Please.
michael Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
dwight I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
michael Not. Good. Enough!
dwight I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year!
michael I have a laundry machine!
dwight I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear.
michael I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
dwight You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?
michael You can get up. Get up. And you can hug it out, bitch.
michael Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just. let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.
jim 
karen 
michael Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.
