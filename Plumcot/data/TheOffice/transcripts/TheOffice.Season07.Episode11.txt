nate Got it.
pam_beesly Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.
michael_scott People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.
jim_halpert One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
pam_beesly Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.
kevin_malone Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'.
andy_bernard Let's just jump in the air!
michael_scott That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
pam_beesly Okay.
nate One, two, three. Not everyone jumped.
michael_scott Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
nate One, two, three. Still some people not jumping.
jim_halpert You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
dwight_schrute I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
phyllis_vance I am jumping.
dwight_schrute You are?
phyllis_vance Yes, I'm jumping.
dwight_schrute Let me see you jump. Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
pam_beesly I'm freezing.
nate Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'.
erin_hannon I didn't want to miss it.
andy_bernard Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.
oscar_martinez Here's a question nobody's asking Is this worth it?
michael_scott Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?
oscar_martinez Why?
michael_scott I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
nate Okay, on three. Uh, everyone in the air. Three, two, one, zero.
michael_scott We didn't get it.
pam_beesly I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.
pam_beesly It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.
jim_halpert Why's it smell real? Ah... good one.
michael_scott Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children!
all@ Merry Christmas.
michael_scott How's everybody doing today?
erin_hannon Good.
michael_scott How's the party coming along?
pam_beesly Great.
michael_scott Are we over budget?
pam_beesly Nope.
michael_scott No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
meredith_palmer Not yet!
michael_scott Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?
angela_martin Nothing. Should be fun.
michael_scott So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
stanley_hudson Pam got those sugar-free cookies I like. I'm doing fine.
michael_scott Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
andy_bernard Yea?
michael_scott Whatcha got?
andy_bernard All good, Santa.
michael_scott Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
michael_scott My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.
kelly_kapoor It's present time, you guys. Happy Holidays from your friends at Sabre.
gabe_lewis We just want to say how grateful we are.
kelly_kapoor Sabre is actively looking for ways to involve me as minority executive trainee. So I suggested choosing the annual Christmas gift to the employees. And they said, "Oh, yes. Perfect. Thank you, Kelly. Finally, something for you to do."
kelly_kapoor It's a Hello Kitty laptop sleeve.
andy_bernard Hello Kitty's for girls.
pam_beesly Nashua got mp3 players.
phyllis_vance Yeah, I don't even have a laptop.
kelly_kapoor I wonder if these presents would be under as much scrutiny if I were white.
meredith_palmer Wow.
phyllis_vance Oh God.
dwight_schrute Oh come on.
kelly_kapoor I said, "I wonder." I didn't say, "I think."
gabe_lewis Kelly, I thought we agreed on fleece blankets.
kelly_kapoor Blankets, what am I, five?
gabe_lewis Erin and I make great use of ours.
gabe_lewis Yes, Erin and I are still dating. Why do you ask me so often if we're still dating?
darryl_philbin I'll take one of those pink pouches.
darryl_philbin I feel good today. My little girl Jada? It's my turn to have her for Christmas this year. Two years ago I had her, and we had the best time. I tivoed her favorite shows, some things I've never heard of. iCarly... You know who's funny on that show? The friend with the video camera. He's got a nice way of talking.
jim_halpert Hey, it's snowing.
dwight_schrute Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
jim_halpert Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
dwight_schrute Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
phyllis_vance Oh, don't be such a baby.
stanley_hudson Yeah, who's a little girl now?
dwight_schrute You apologize to me right now.
jim_halpert You've got something on your nose.
dwight_schrute You apologize right now.
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
jim_halpert You got it.
andy_bernard That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?
dwight_schrute No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go.
kevin_malone Angela, are you bringing you new boyfriend to the party.
angela_martin I wouldn't subject Robert to that. He's a very busy senator.
oscar_martinez State senator.
angela_martin I would not expect you to know what it's like to date someone in the public arena.
oscar_martinez Who are you dating in the public arena?
angela_martin The senator.
kevin_malone Oh, right. The state senator.
angela_martin We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
kevin_malone Oh, that would be impressive... if anyone knew what a comptroller was.
oscar_martinez Well...
angela_martin Do you have any idea how many photographers there are at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. I do. Two. "Angela..." "over here, Angela..." "here. Look here!"
pam_beesly Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
michael_scott Yeah!
pam_beesly A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
michael_scott Pam? Pam?
dwight_schrute Pam?
pam_beesly Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.
toby_flenderson Hi guys.
michael_scott Hi.
toby_flenderson Uh, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I'll be taking a leave of absence starting next week.
michael_scott Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
toby_flenderson Uh, no, the opposite. I was actually selected to be a juror on a very high-profile case.
michael_scott Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
dwight_schrute Death to Toby!
toby_flenderson Okay, that's hurtful talk. We've talked about that. You know, I don't interrupt your announcements.
michael_scott You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
phyllis_vance What's the case, Toby?
toby_flenderson Well, I really can't talk about it, but it's a very high profile case.
andy_bernard Is it criminal?
toby_flenderson Yes.
andy_bernard Have we heard of it?
toby_flenderson I don't know.
dwight_schrute Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a s*x slave?
toby_flenderson Come on.
meredith_palmer Was it the post office guy who rubbed his pen1s all over the mail?
toby_flenderson Guys, it's a really big deal.
ryan_howard He's rubbing his neck. He's rubbing his neck!
kelly_kapoor He's rubbing his neck.
ryan_howard He's rubbing his neck.
andy_bernard Oh, Scranton Strangler!
toby_flenderson I can neither confirm nor deny this. Let's just say I'll be up to my neck in jury duty.
michael_scott That was the worst joke ever.
toby_flenderson Corporate will be sending someone else to take my place for a while.
michael_scott Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
toby_flenderson Uh, Holly Flax, she comes from the Nashua branch.
michael_scott What? What?
toby_flenderson Yeah, uh, she'll be starting next week. If you have any questions about the transition, just let me know.
michael_scott Hold on, Holly's coming back here?
toby_flenderson Yeah.
erin_hannon Guys, who's Holly?
michael_scott That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
erin_hannon Wow.
creed_bratton She's one sassy black lady.
michael_scott Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
gabe_lewis I'm not sure the temporary replacement of an H.R. rep really warrants a party.
michael_scott You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
dwight_schrute Okay.
michael_scott Cancel. We're canceling it.
angela_martin No, don't throw those out!
michael_scott No, we have to cancel the party.
angela_martin We can save that.
michael_scott No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
andy_bernard I bought these.
michael_scott I know.
andy_bernard These cookies are fine.
michael_scott It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
pam_beesly Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.
michael_scott Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.
pam_beesly I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.
michael_scott You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
michael_scott Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.
michael_scott We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow!
angela_martin Just stop moving your calves so much while you're talking.
michael_scott Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
angela_martin Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend. I'll invite him.
michael_scott Okay. Sure.
angela_martin I mean, unless there's any chance there could be press at this party.
michael_scott You never know about the press.
angela_martin Well, I only ask because he's a senator.
michael_scott Could he help us with some parking tickets?
angela_martin I don't think that's appropriate.
michael_scott Well, then he's not a senator.
angela_martin Yes, he is.
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert We still doing the gifts today? I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
pam_beesly Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.
jim_halpert Me neither. Whew.
pam_beesly Okay.
pam_beesly I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.
jim_halpert
michael_scott Okay... Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!
pam_beesly No, it has the little...
michael_scott Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
bassist Player Hi, I'm looking for Michael Scott.
michael_scott Yes, that's me. Come on it.
michael_scott There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?
pam_beesly Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
kevin_malone I would, but I don't want to get dirty. There might be girls at the party.
pam_beesly Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.
andy_bernard I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.
kevin_malone Yeah.
andy_bernard I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.
pam_beesly Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.
andy_bernard You know Darryl?
pam_beesly Yeah. He works here. We all know him.
andy_bernard I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.
pam_beesly Cool.
darryl_philbin Come on, now, Justine, look... Listen, look, I've been planning this, okay? You cannot do this, Justine.
Justine#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode11 I'm not doing it! She told me she wants to have Christmas here.
darryl_philbin She did?
Justine#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode11 Yes. She wants to be around family for Christmas.
darryl_philbin I don't know... I thought I was enough family for my daughter.
darryl_philbin Don't come in, I'm busy.
andy_bernard It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.
pam_beesly Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.
darryl_philbin Uh, no.
andy_bernard Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.
darryl_philbin No. Thank you for your interest in my truck.
pam_beesly Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.
darryl_philbin Hey... You know what, I could use a breath of fresh air. Let's do it.
michael_scott When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.
erin_hannon I've looked her up online... there's nothing about her. She's made no impression on the internet.
michael_scott She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.
erin_hannon Oh...
toby_flenderson Hey.
michael_scott What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
toby_flenderson Uh, we're on recess. I came for the party. Hey, everyone.
kevin_malone Hi, Toby.
meredith_palmer What does the strangler look like? Is he gorgeous? He looks gorgeous in the drawings.
kevin_malone Yeah.
meredith_palmer That scowl.
toby_flenderson I can't talk about it or I'll get removed from the jury.
michael_scott And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
toby_flenderson I know people are only this excited to talk to me because of the trial. But, they talk to me for a while, and maybe people realize I have something to say. And then one day, we're just talking.
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave...
dwight_schrute Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
jim_halpert Stop! Stop!
dwight_schrute Ahh!
jim_halpert Oh... oh!
dwight_schrute
dwight_schrute I have no feeling in my fingers or pen1s. But I think it was worth it.
dwight_schrute Haahh!!
jim_halpert Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, then... "How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight."
holly_flax Hi.
erin_hannon Hello.
holly_flax Is there any way I can get a hand with these, please?
erin_hannon I'm really sorry, I can't help you. I'm waiting for my boss' pretty friend to arrive.
michael_scott There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?
erin_hannon Oh, you're Holly! Of course. Sorry.
michael_scott Hello.
holly_flax Well, well, well, if it isn't Michael Scott. You old b*st*rd.
michael_scott Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old b*st*rd.
holly_flax Well I did show my face around these parts, you old b*st*rd.
michael_scott Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?
holly_flax I most certainly am.
michael_scott Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
holly_flax Unnnnnnngh!
michael_scott D'oh!
holly_flax Oh, Homey.
jim_halpert Okay... Holly's back.
michael_scott Hi. Hi. Oh...
holly_flax Oh, huggy monster!
michael_scott Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
holly_flax Hi.
kevin_malone Did you bring us anything from Nashua?
holly_flax Oh, yeah. I brought um, some maple candy. But I have to admit, I got a little hungry on the drive, and I ate some of them.
michael_scott That's adorable.
holly_flax Would you put those out?
erin_hannon To throw out? Or put out, like, six pieces for everyone?
holly_flax Oh, it's so nice to be back. It looks beautiful in here. Super classy. It's like a party for limousine drivers.
michael_scott Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
holly_flax Oh, it's fabulous. I love what you did.
michael_scott Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. I show you to your desk.
holly_flax Watch out for my guns they're both loaded.
michael_scott What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
jim_halpert Aww...
holly_flax It's a pea shoot...
michael_scott This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?
holly_flax Yeah, kind of.
michael_scott Oh...
holly_flax Oh...
michael_scott Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! Oh, I love toy...
holly_flax AJ gave me that.
michael_scott Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
holly_flax Mmhmm.
michael_scott You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
holly_flax Why?
michael_scott Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
holly_flax That is a really good point. AJ said he hadn't seen any of the Toy Story movies.
michael_scott You're kidding me. Ahh!
holly_flax No. I know. I was like, "What? Are you serious?"
michael_scott What a douche bag!
holly_flax Get a life!
michael_scott Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
holly_flax We sat down and we watched them all in one day.
michael_scott Mmhmm.
holly_flax Now he's the biggest Toy Story fanatic ever.
michael_scott Good for him.
holly_flax Next day I found him in my bed.
michael_scott Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
holly_flax We live together.
michael_scott Oh, you do?
holly_flax He had a little note pinned to him that said, "You've got a friend in me."
michael_scott Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
holly_flax Yeah. I love him.
michael_scott Me too.
andy_bernard Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
pam_beesly Hey, how about this one?
andy_bernard Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
pam_beesly Maybe. I mean...
darryl_philbin I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, oh... pick a damn tree already.
pam_beesly Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.
andy_bernard I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.
darryl_philbin Jada don't want to spend Christmas with me. She told her mom it wasn't as much fun. And how could she say that? You know, I took her to the toy store to buy her own presents.
pam_beesly Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.
darryl_philbin Her mom wants me to take her to mass. I guess that's something to do.
pam_beesly No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.
darryl_philbin How do I do that?
pam_beesly Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.
andy_bernard Yes.
pam_beesly You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.
pam_beesly Hey guys, the tree's here.
michael_scott Hey.
andy_bernard Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...
oscar_martinez Why would someone hug you?
michael_scott Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
darryl_philbin Are you serious?
michael_scott It's a sophisticated take.
jada He doesn't look like Santa Claus.
darryl_philbin No, he doesn't. I told her Santa would be here.
michael_scott Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
pam_beesly Who told you that?
michael_scott Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
phyllis_vance So is it an open relationship?
holly_flax Oh, God, no.
kelly_kapoor Well, you're almost 40. Oh, do you not want kids?
holly_flax Oh, I want kids. I really want kids. But AJ and I are practically engaged. We talk about spending our lives together.
kelly_kapoor So where's the ring?
pam_beesly Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?
phyllis_vance Nobody cares about that. Look, you have to make him commit, or kick his butt to the curb.
pam_beesly You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.
erin_hannon Yeah, I mean, maybe Holly's not in any position to be shooing guys away.
erin_hannon I don't get it! I'm sorry. I just, I don't get it!
holly_flax Okay, listen, I'm gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose by the end of this year, we're over.
pam_beesly Wow, an ultimatum.
holly_flax Yeah.
pam_beesly It doesn't really seem like you.
kelly_kapoor That is a great idea. Ultimatums are key. Basically, nobody does anything for me anymore unless I threaten to kill myself.
dwight_schrute
jim_halpert Don't. Stop, Dwight! Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
dwight_schrute Oh, no. Oh, no!
jim_halpert Stop!
dwight_schrute Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
jim_halpert Okay. Okay. Okay.
dwight_schrute Huh? You like that?
jim_halpert Seriously!
dwight_schrute Huh?
jim_halpert Okay. Okay.
dwight_schrute Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
jim_halpert I just want it to stop.
pam_beesly So, cool right?
ryan_howard There's no connection between the origin story and the quest.
pam_beesly Okay.
ryan_howard We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
pam_beesly Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?
ryan_howard Well, did you come here for help, or did you come here for me to tell you how great it is?
pam_beesly I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...
ryan_howard Well, it sounds like you know what you want. It's also a little derivative of a serias called 'Bear Man'. Did you look that up?
pam_beesly No.
ryan_howard Okay.
toby_flenderson Oh, Jim. Hey.
jim_halpert Hey, Toby.
toby_flenderson There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
jim_halpert No way.
toby_flenderson Who looks exactly like you.
jim_halpert That's increadible.
toby_flenderson Yeah. No, it's uncanny.
jim_halpert You know what's crazy?
toby_flenderson What?
jim_halpert I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. Excuse me.
michael_scott I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that.
angela_martin It's so cold. Even with my coat on.
meredith_palmer Maybe your senator boyfriend has a blanket in his car... for screwing Americans.
gabe_lewis Yet another opportunity where a blanket would have come in handy.
holly_flax You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
michael_scott What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
dwight_schrute I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
jim_halpert What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
dwight_schrute With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
holly_flax Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
michael_scott All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
dwight_schrute Wait, what girlfriend?
michael_scott I haven't told you about her.
dwight_schrute I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
michael_scott I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
holly_flax I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
michael_scott I do. She is.
michael_scott Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.
phyllis_vance So you went homemade this year.
pam_beesly Yup.
phyllis_vance Yeah. Money problems, is that what this is about? I mean, oh, dear, I don't think we can help you out.
pam_beesly No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.
phyllis_vance Are you good at homemade?
pam_beesly Look at this.
phyllis_vance Yeah...
holly_flax Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving.
phyllis_vance Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you.
erin_hannon That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
michael_scott What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
toby_flenderson No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
michael_scott Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.
kevin_malone Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking. You don't think... it's not possible... that Woody did this to himself.
michael_scott It is Christmas.
angela_martin No, it really seems like something Michael would do.
michael_scott Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
andy_bernard Why would anyone frame you for that?
jim_halpert Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly?
michael_scott Ahhhhhh! Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
holly_flax You think this is funny?
michael_scott I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
jim_halpert Yikes.
kevin_malone Oh no, that's, that's not happening.
dwight_schrute Dear God in heaven.
michael_scott All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
holly_flax Michael, you have to let this go. I'm with someone else. I don't feel that way anymore.
michael_scott Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.
dwight_schrute Okay, hey, hey, hey...
jim_halpert No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
holly_flax You made up a fake girlfriend to see if I'd get jealous? And you destroyed a gift my boyfriend gave me? What is the matter with you?
michael_scott When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
holly_flax Michael, I'm sorry.
michael_scott And we did this whole stupid party for you.
erin_hannon No.
holly_flax You guys, it wasn't my fault.
kevin_malone Oh, nothing is ever your fault! Just like when you ate those maple candies that you brought for us!
erin_hannon I really think you're better off.
michael_scott Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
erin_hannon Yeah. Is she an amazing cook or something?
jim_halpert "Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese." Damn it, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
stanley_hudson So do they bring in food, or do you get to go out?
toby_flenderson No, they bring it in.
stanley_hudson You lucky son of a bitch.
stanley_hudson I have been trying to get on jury duty every single year since I was 18 years old. To get to go sit in an air-conditioned room downtown, judging people while my lunch is paid for... that is the life.
jada Daddy, I'm bored. Can I read my book in your office?
darryl_philbin Sure, sweetie.
pam_beesly Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?
pam_beesly Oh, my goodness.
andy_bernard I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.
darryl_philbin Ohh, that sounds fun and Christmasy, you mean old grinch!
jada What kind of challenges.
andy_bernard Wahhh...
pam_beesly Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?
andy_bernard No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?
jada I don't know.
andy_bernard Do you know the other state?
darryl_philbin Maybe the grinch hid the Christmas star, and we could ask for clues, and he'll tell us if we're hot or cold.
andy_bernard The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear!
darryl_philbin And the game's over seconds later.
angela_martin I'm so glad you could come.
state_senator_rob_lipton It's nice. I know.
angela_martin Hey everybody, this is my boyfriend, Senator Robert Lipton.
state_senator_rob_lipton Hi.
oscar_martinez Senator, it's an honor. I'm Angela's friend Oscar.
state_senator_rob_lipton Oscar. A pleasure.
oscar_martinez Robert seems great. He's very handsome, firm handshake, he's gay, good sense of humor.
a_j Hi.
erin_hannon Hello.
a_j I'm, uh, I'm AJ. I'm here to see Holly. It's kind of a surprise.
erin_hannon I know who you are, and I think you should go.
kevin_malone I bet you didn't even bring us anything, did you?
a_j Was I supposed to bring you guys something?
holly_flax What? AJ!
a_j Surprise.
holly_flax What are you doing here? Oh, my God.
a_j I wanted to see you. How are you?
holly_flax Wow! Nice.
a_j Oh, God, you look great.
holly_flax Oh... when did you get here?
a_j Just now.
michael_scott Hey
a_j Just now. Hey, Michael.
michael_scott Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
a_j Pleased to see you. Thank you.
michael_scott Good trip down?
a_j Yeah, it was great.
michael_scott Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
michael_scott I am dead inside.
darryl_philbin What do you want, baby? We got some granola, got some cupcakes, chips, apples, pies...
jada You have a whole room of vending machines?
creed_bratton I know. Isn't it something?
jada I can't decide what I want.
darryl_philbin Merry Christmas.
jada Merry Christmas.
pam_beesly Thank you.
jada And Merry Christmas.
meredith_palmer Thank you.
jada And Merry Christ... mas.
state_senator_rob_lipton Thank you so much.
jada Merry Christmas. And Merry Christmas.
oscar_martinez Merry Christmas to you.
jada Merry Christmas.
bassist Player Oh, thank you.
kevin_malone For your feet!
ryan_howard It's amazing. It's so great. Thank you.
creed_bratton For me?
angela_martin Yes.
creed_bratton Thank you very much.
angela_martin Mmhmm.
angela_martin I don't know if you guys have had a chance to use the new parking meters that accept credit cards, but Robert was instrumental in that legislation.
kevin_malone Wow, that's awesome!
oscar_martinez A real David and Goliath story.
state_senator_rob_lipton I'm just so touched that she's so interested in my work.
angela_martin I am.
meredith_palmer The real problem is the teachers' union.
angela_martin Zip it, Meredith.
meredith_palmer No. You tell me why my kid is 17 and still can't read.
ryan_howard Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
angela_martin You are. You make your own drink.
oscar_martinez I'll make it. What are you drinking.
ryan_howard An 'F' train to Brooklyn. Extra bitters.
oscar_martinez I don't know how to make that.
ryan_howard Okay, well, I'll just stick with my mojito.
angela_martin And you know those annoying geese at the park? Well, he's helping eradicate them as well. I mean, I think they've really become a pest.
meredith_palmer Annoying.
angela_martin Yes.
pam_beesly I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.
jim_halpert Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright.
pam_beesly Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica?
jim_halpert Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
pam_beesly Oh, my God.
jim_halpert You like it?
pam_beesly I love it.
jim_halpert Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.
jim_halpert Alright, my turn.
pam_beesly Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.
jim_halpert Right. Of course. "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
jim_halpert I mean...
pam_beesly Michael, wait!
michael_scott Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
pam_beesly That's good advice.
michael_scott Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
pam_beesly That's a sad story.
michael_scott Yeah, well, at least he was married.
pam_beesly Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.
michael_scott No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
pam_beesly I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.
michael_scott Really?
pam_beesly Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?
michael_scott No.
pam_beesly So just be patient.
michael_scott Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.
jim_halpert I surrender.
dwight_schrute I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
jim_halpert Anything. You got it.
dwight_schrute You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
jim_halpert You're a psychopath.
dwight_schrute I'll take that as a no.
michael_scott I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.
kelly_kapoor Michael, this is the gift that corporate gave us that I picked out. You're re-gifting this to me.
michael_scott No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
kelly_kapoor Oh, yeah? Well, show me the receipt.
michael_scott From the mall. That...
kelly_kapoor This is a fast food receipt from April.
michael_scott Well, that...
kelly_kapoor God, how many number nines did you order?
a_j Is everyone here kind of mean?
holly_flax Oh, I think everyone's on edge because of the strangler trial.
a_j Oh.
holly_flax Hey, I'm so glad you came down. It's been so much harder than I expected.
a_j Hey, what happened to Woody?
holly_flax Oh, okay, get ready for this. You're not gonna believe it. I was making salad, and he fell right into the dressing. I mean, there was salad dressing all over him.
a_j He smells awful.
holly_flax It was blue cheese dressing.
a_j Great.
darryl_philbin Hey, Mike.
michael_scott Hey.
darryl_philbin We wanted to give you something.
michael_scott Oh.
jada Merry Christmas.
michael_scott Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
darryl_philbin What do you say?
jada You're welcome.
michael_scott Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
jada Yeah.
michael_scott I think I know where he is.
jada A trampoline...
michael_scott Mmhmm.
jada Video games.
michael_scott Video games.
jada A DSi.
michael_scott A DSi?
jada A horse.
michael_scott A horse.
jada A pool.
michael_scott You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?
jada Yes.
michael_scott All right. You have to pick up after them.
pam_beesly Hey, sorry. I'm ready.
jim_halpert I don't want to go.
pam_beesly Oh... come on, bear man. Come on.
jim_halpert Have you ever seen 'em do that?
pam_beesly I'm sorry. I had no idea.
jim_halpert No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
pam_beesly Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
jim_halpert Okay. This is it.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert Go! Go! Go!
pam_beesly What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! Honey? Jim? Jim!
dwight_schrute In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
