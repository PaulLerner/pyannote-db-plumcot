michael_scott I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.
michael_scott I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
michael_scott And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre.'
nashua_employee How's Jim?
pam_beesly We're engaged.
nashua_employee Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
pam_beesly Oh, wow, thank you!
michael_scott You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left... and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
pam_beesly ... Okay, let's go.
oscar_martinez Two?
kevin_malone I didn't eat lunch. I didn't eat all my lunch.
angela_martin Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
kevin_malone It... yeah.
oscar_martinez Angela, you're more chipper than usual.
angela_martin I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents.' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
meredith_palmer How much?
angela_martin Seven thousand dollars.
creed_bratton For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
oscar_martinez Where'd you get that kind of money?
angela_martin I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
kevin_malone Wait, you didn't give it back?
angela_martin He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
meredith_palmer Seven grand?
angela_martin Mm-hmm.
meredith_palmer I gotta see that little bitch.
angela_martin I have something better than a picture. Come on.
oscar_martinez You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
angela_martin Yeah. I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
meredith_palmer She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
angela_martin Right. Anyways... I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
kevin_malone Any cat, you mean.
angela_martin And person.
pam_beesly So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! I've been driving too long.
dwight_schrute What did you do?
kelly_kapoor Stop yelling at me!
dwight_schrute What did you do?
kelly_kapoor I didn't do anything!
dwight_schrute What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
jim_halpert Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
dwight_schrute Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
kelly_kapoor I was kickin' it.
dwight_schrute In juvie.
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
jim_halpert Yep.
dwight_schrute For reha-
jim_halpert Got it.
dwight_schrute What did you do? Huh?
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
dwight_schrute Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. What did you do?
kelly_kapoor My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
dwight_schrute I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
jim_halpert Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
kelly_kapoor You did? I wanna see the cake.
jim_halpert And... ta da.
kelly_kapoor I hate it.
jim_halpert How do you hate it? It's a cake.
kelly_kapoor Well, there's no flowers... or toys... or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
jim_halpert Right.
jim_halpert I forgot if there was an "e" between the "l" and the "y." I still don't know.
kelly_kapoor I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
jim_halpert Birthday.
dwight_schrute Frosting.
kelly_kapoor Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme.
phyllis_vance There's always a theme.
dwight_schrute Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
jim_halpert Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
pam_beesly Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
michael_scott Do I look okay?
pam_beesly You look good.
michael_scott Hi.
receptionist Hi, can I help you?
michael_scott Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
receptionist Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat.
michael_scott Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
receptionist Actually, she's on an HR retreat for the next three days.
michael_scott Oh- She's not here?
receptionist But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A.J. He's a salesman here.
michael_scott A.J.
receptionist Yeah, he's her boyfriend. He's just over there.
michael_scott She has a boyfriend.
pam_beesly I'm so sorry, Michael.
michael_scott How could she do this to me, Pam?
pam_beesly She's not doing it to hurt you.
michael_scott I can't do the presentation, I can't- ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God!
pam_beesly Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
michael_scott I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay?
pam_beesly You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
michael_scott And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
pam_beesly Yeah, maybe.
michael_scott
pam_beesly Maybe. One step at a time.
michael_scott
pam_beesly You can do this.
michael_scott I can do this.
oscar_martinez It could be snacks, or-
kevin_malone Why would we-
oscar_martinez Wha-
kevin_malone Is that what I think it is?
oscar_martinez Good God!
kevin_malone
oscar_martinez
angela_martin
kevin_malone That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
angela_martin No!
meredith_palmer Awesome!
angela_martin Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
meredith_palmer Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.
kevin_malone No way.
angela_martin No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
kevin_malone Oh, the other one's watching.
jim_halpert Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
dwight_schrute Busy!
jim_halpert Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
dwight_schrute Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
jim_halpert You know what? I could use a little help.
dwight_schrute You know what? I'm a little busy.
jim_halpert We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
dwight_schrute It's not effeminate. It's festive.
jim_halpert You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
stanley_hudson I know, I just read it on the sign.
michael_scott Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper" and get them to "Show us the money!" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?
a_j A.J.
michael_scott A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
a_j
michael_scott What do you race cars?
a_j I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand.
michael_scott Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
a_j Yeah. Why, are you interested?
toby_flenderson I have a question about discounts from distributors.
michael_scott Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
a_j It's pretty serious, yes.
michael_scott Huh- Does she ever talk about me?
pam_beesly Oh, God.
a_j Excuse me?
nashua_employee What does this have to do with sales?
michael_scott It's all connected. Shut up. Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
a_j No, what are you talking about?
michael_scott Does it feel good?
a_j Does what feel good?
michael_scott Your life. Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. Oh, wow. Ooh, okay.
pam_beesly Michael, get off the floor!
michael_scott Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
pam_beesly No, no, no, you have to do it-
michael_scott No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. Okay... okay.
pam_beesly That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation. Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
pam_beesly Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! Cutting down the competition.
angela_martin Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
oscar_martinez
kevin_malone
angela_martin
kevin_malone This is getting weird.
oscar_martinez Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue?
kevin_malone Ohhh...
michael_scott
angela_martin Has this been on the entire time?
oscar_martinez I have no idea.
kevin_malone I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
angela_martin Well, sorry I'm late.
oscar_martinez I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
pam_beesly Don't look up. Don't look up.
michael_scott Want some pie?
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott I went through Holly's things.
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
pam_beesly Oh, Michael...
michael_scott I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael."
pam_beesly You did what?
michael_scott I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
pam_beesly She never sent it to you?
michael_scott No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
michael_scott How?
pam_beesly Because, she didn't send it to you!
michael_scott I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
pam_beesly I could read it.
michael_scott No, that wouldn't-
pam_beesly Yeah, I could read it.
michael_scott No, you don't have to do that.
pam_beesly Go get your laptop.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly What? I'm not in love with her.
dwight_schrute You have to write my suggestions down, too.
jim_halpert I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt." I don't even know what that means.
dwight_schrute It's in the name.
jim_halpert Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
dwight_schrute You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
jim_halpert Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
dwight_schrute Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord.
jim_halpert Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
dwight_schrute Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. What about you?
jim_halpert Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
dwight_schrute That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
jim_halpert Didn't see that one coming.
pam_beesly It's deleted.
michael_scott Well?
pam_beesly She still has feelings for you.
michael_scott She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
pam_beesly I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.
michael_scott You're sure?
pam_beesly
michael_scott Okay.
kelly_kapoor
all@ Happy Birthday!
meredith_palmer Surprise!
dwight_schrute Hey, it's not a surprise.
jim_halpert Not a surprise.
kelly_kapoor This doesn't look good.
jim_halpert What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
kelly_kapoor
dwight_schrute Told you.
jim_halpert You haven't heard our theme, though.
kelly_kapoor You don't hear a theme, you see it... why is there a chicklet on my cake?
jim_halpert That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
dwight_schrute Our theme, if you will.
jim_halpert Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
dwight_schrute That's our theme.
kelly_kapoor Cool.
jim_halpert Yeah?
kelly_kapoor I love it.
dwight_schrute Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
kevin_malone Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert No.
kevin_malone Oh, then pick TV.
meredith_palmer Take a nap!
oscar_martinez TV.
kevin_malone No, watching TV at work is really cool.
stanley_hudson Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
creed_bratton Bonnie Hunt is on.
kelly_kapoor You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
jim_halpert All right.
dwight_schrute Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
meredith_palmer Surprise.
dwight_schrute Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
jim_halpert Ahem. This is for you... and ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
kelly_kapoor Thank you.
dwight_schrute Okay, you've got one hour.
kelly_kapoor I'm too excited to sleep.
dwight_schrute Mm, great cake.
jim_halpert Thanks.
dwight_schrute Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. Many happy returns.
michael_scott I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
pam_beesly No, we don't need to do that.
michael_scott Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
pam_beesly You mean Tony?
michael_scott Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
pam_beesly Oh, Michael.
michael_scott Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
