erin Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. david Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
dwight How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
doctor Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father.
angela I told you
kevin Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles.
oscar That piece doesn't go there.
kevin So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn't get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
pam For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
jim You are really good at modesty. She's a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children—
pam Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
jim Oh, yeah
pam Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea jim had when they were back in college.
jim Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
pam And he wanted jim to be a part of it too.
jim In Philly, so, that doesn't really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
pam He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car.
jim An Altima or better.
toby kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fiancé Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
kelly I don't need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
toby Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, kelly was still a little confused about it
kelly Enjoy the snow losers.
erin I'm so happy for you Kelly.
toby Shortly after kelly left, ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
ryan I've actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It's a big university town. And, uh, that's not garbage, it's out clothes.
pam And that was our summer.
jim we good? Off-
camera Yeah
pam Don't you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company. Off-
camera Well we're more following you guys, to see how you turn out.
pam Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
erin Andy's coming back today!
clark Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
stanley Oh, my god. It's called a garbage can.
phyllis Helpless.
toby There's two new guys back there with me now. They're in their 20s. And we really get along.
clark You're looking good.
toby Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.
stanley They're like the new jim and Dwight.
nellie Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect.
meredith Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
pete No thank you. My name's Pete.
jim No, pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
erin Andy's here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy's here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy's here. Pam, he's here.
andy Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
nellie It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
andy What're you still doing here?
nellie Wonderful, thanks.
andy You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
nellie Brilliant.
andy See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's clark and, um—
pete Pete!
andy In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
pete What? Why?
andy Cause you're always taking dumps.
pete No I'm not.
andy Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
clark I love it.
darryl Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
clark No, I prefer Fart.
andy No, dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
dwight I don't see it.
clark I don't either.
andy Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him dwight Jr?
dwight Yes, yes I am.
andy Dwight, Jr!
dwight In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.
angela Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
kevin The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
kevin Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin.
angela No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . He's such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
kevin I'll take him.
angela Please, after the turtle?
kevin I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
angela Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
oscar No, I'm a dog person.
angela If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
oscar Those guys always change back, Angela.
andy David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
david Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
toby Hey you wanted to see me?
andy Yeah, I gotta go David. Why is nellie still here?
toby You can only fire nellie for cause.
andy Mm, then I will make up a cause.
toby Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
andy Then forget I just told you that.
toby Can't. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
andy Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
dwight Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
clark Yep, body by Cheez-it
dwight Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
clark I think I'm busy that night. Or I would.
dwight Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?
clark Learning what?
dwight Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
clark Kay.
dwight So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
clark Is this—is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you should know that I'm into the ladies.
dwight Spoken like a true root man.
clark You know, if you're ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
dwight My calls?
clark So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet?
dwight You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
clark Yeah, I'll just give it a glance—
dwight Ok
clark I'll give it a read.
dwight With my leads and stuff like that?
clark Yeah.
dwight Cause you're interested in going into sales?
clark I am.
dwight Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?
clark Ok.
dwight You're not getting my clients! Nice try. . push;
dwight Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
dwight Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
jim Done. Explain.
dwight The new guys. dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
jim Oh, now I get what pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
dwight Wait, sales—what sales meeting?
jim The new guys called one.
dwight The new guys called a sales meeting?
jim clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
dwight There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
jim You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. Too easy.
angela Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn't given me a definite yes or no.
oscar Definitely no.
angela Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I'm fine with either, but not both. Listen, you're in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
andy I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible.
nellie Not necessarily
andy No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you.
andy Now this is called slack lining.
andy I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
andy If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, rafe and Feather.
rafe Iceman.
andy That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
jim You a sports fan?
pete Sure, boxing, tennis.
jim Oh. Any team sports?
pete NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
jim Phillies fan, though, right?
pete You mean horses?
jim No, like baseball. A baseball team.
pete Ah, I like the Red Sox. I'm from Vermont.
jim Ok. Good talk.
jim I have nothing in common with Plop.
andy All right, who's next? Nellie?
nellie Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
andy Nonsense. Get up here.
kevin Go ahead
andy Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
nellie I'm very self-conscious about my feet.
andy Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?
darryl This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
andy dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
clark Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
andy Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
clark Ok
andy Focus on the horizon. Whoa! Look at this guy.
clark I've always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
darryl Go, dwight Jr!
andy Hey, yes.
dwight Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!
clark Alright, let's see you do it.
andy Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
andy Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
dwight Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
clark You got this, it's all you. Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It's not a race, Dwight.
andy Well it's official. Old dwight is lame and New dwight is cool.
dwight That's not true. Just give me another chance.
oscar But your mouth is ble—
toby This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this.
dwight What?
toby It is enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work.
dwight This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Idiots.
dwight Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!
pam Dwight!
dwight Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
pam What are you doing?
dwight Come here, I'll show you.
angela Why do you want this cat?
pete I don't want it, really.
angela How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
pete I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
angela Have you taken any concrete steps?
pete Well, I'm still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
jim Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. Wow, maybe pete is the new Jim.
dwight Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
pam I will?
dwight You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?
pam Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
dwight So you'll do it?
pam No.
dwight Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
pam Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
dwight Come on.
pam Exactly the way it is.
dwight No, Pam.
pam Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
dwight Please? Please, Pam?
pam Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis.
dwight I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive.
pete Why are you getting rid of it?
angela Allergies.
pete Your husband?
angela No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night.
oscar You know what? I will take Comstock.
angela Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
oscar I'll come by after work and pick him up.
angela Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won't get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
oscar C'est la vie.
angela Please don't teach the cat French.
oscar Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
pam You ready?
jim Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
pam Kay.
dwight Ok. Oh, god.
dwight Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. dwight Schrute!
jim Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah!
dwight Woo! Ahh!!
creed In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a dwight impersonator and a jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
meredith Crap. Sorry, Nellie.
nellie Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would—
stanley Mm, swish.
nellie Oh, it's nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
andy There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
nellie Fluke.
