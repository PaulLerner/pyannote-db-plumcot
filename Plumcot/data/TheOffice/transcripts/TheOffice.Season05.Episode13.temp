dwight Hmm. It wasn't here before.
jim Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
dwight Yours doesn't.
jim Doesn't it?
dwight No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
jim Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore.
phyllis Dwight, get out of here!
stanley What are you doing?
jim I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
michael What you talking bout, Wallace?
david Hi michael how are you?
michael Hi, I am well, how are you?
david So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
michael Oh, have you not?
david Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
michael Yeah.
david There is a small company there, prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
michael Okay.
david I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
michael Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
david Look, this is important, Michael.
michael Oh, well, then, email it to me.
phyllis You've got no taste stanley Hudson.
stanley Oh, I do.
andy What are you guys talking about?
stanley Some actress, whether shes hot.
andy Who is the gal in question?
phyllis Hillary Swank.
creed Ah, Hillary Swank.
kevin Not at all.
meredith She's got mean eyes.
pam Have you seen her with her bangs?
kevin She looks like a monster.
jim Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
meredith She is an amazing actress.
kevin That is not the question.
phyllis She's not hot.
kevin Yeah, thank you Phyllis.
jim Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
angela I'm not voting.
jim No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand.
kevin Five. Five to five.
jim Thank you, accounting department.
kevin So what do we do now?
dwight What if the owner of prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
michael I will seduce her.
dwight No, I wanna seduce her.
michael No, I will seduce her.
dwight Please Michael, please.
michael No, I got it.
dwight You'll fall in love with her.
michael Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
dwight Okay, let's go over the plan again.
michael Alright, I am a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies
dwight Your fictitious name?
michael michael Scarn.
dwight I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
michael Okay.
dwight Then we meet at the Denny's.
michael No.
dwight . and then we compare notes.
michael No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
dwight No!
dwight You know how I feel about IHOP.
michael Oh, don't start,
dwight Are you socialist?
michael You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
dwight I'll have a cup of a coffee.
michael You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
dwight Store only has three employees.
michael So what?
dwight It means they are not expanding.
michael Maybe they are shrinking.
dwight No.
michael They could be shrinking.
dwight No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
michael Ah ha Yup.
dwight Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
michael Mm hmm .
dwight Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
michael And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
dwight Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
michael Argh, why are you all.
dwight Get your clouds right.
michael Shut up.
dwight So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. No, no like this. Good.
michael Ready to do this?
dwight Yeah.
michael Good. Here come the sharks.
michael In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
michael Hello. Entire prince
family Hello, hi.
michael My name is michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company. prince
grandfather Oh, please come in
michael Thank you. prince
grandfather What kind of business are you in.
michael We are a law firm. prince
grandfather I assume your primary paper needs are stationary, general office.
michael You know, I will be honest with you. about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question for you would be how many clients do you have? prince
grandfather About 80.
michael Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation. prince
grandfather It's just me, my wife and my son.
michael Ah, so when did you set up shop? prince
grandfather I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.
michael Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely . prince
grandfather Mmhmm.
andy Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments.
topic Hillary Swank is attractive. Entire
office Hot!
kevin The debate is whether she is hot.
stanley What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
kevin Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
andy Okay, TMI.
michael So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock? prince
grandfather You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.
michael Well that is. because. I am a genius. prince
grandfather Oh really?
michael Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? Is this the cup? Is this what I drink out of? Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
dwight Hello, I would like to apply for a job. prince
grandfather Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now.
dwight Why don't you just get rid of this guy? prince
grandfather That's my son.
dwight I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
michael Try 80.
dwight Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business. prince
grandfather I sure hope not.
dwight Me too. . push;
jim I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
kevin Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
oscar Kevin, c'mon.
kelly Yeah, shut up Kevin.
kevin He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
jim Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you and says kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? Does that end the debate?
kevin No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
angela Oh my God.
jim This close.
prince 
grandfather So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin?
dwight My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings.
michael Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
dwight It's going very well.
michael Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
linda You want a picture of me?
michael I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left
linda Can I get a copy of that? prince
granddaughter Grandma, I can't do this.
michael What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right? prince
granddaughter Right.
michael Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4? prince
granddaughter 8
michael Excellent! Way to go! Nice! prince
grandmother Don't put that.
kevin Ladies and gentlemen, even though the pen1s was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
pam Kevin!
angela Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
jim OH!
michael Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision. prince
grandfather Wait; let me get something for you. Here is some, some references. Here is a list of references, our top clients. You call any of them; I trust you will hear some good things.
michael I. Okay, okay, okay, alright, thank you.
dwight Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
michael Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
dwight Thank you very much.
michael I cannot wait to contact your clients.
dwight Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. prince
grandfather Bye bye now. So long. dwight and
michael Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
michael Haha, we struck the mother load!
dwight Cmon.
michael Wallace is going to freak.
dwight All their top clients I can't believe it.
michael He's going to absolutely freak.
dwight Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go.
michael Oh shoot.
dwight You drove over that. Go back
michael Oh God, what was that?
dwight That's not good.
kelly No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank!
dwight Oh my God.
michael Aw, it's alright.
dwight Oh man,
michael Aw, my car.
dwight Not good. prince
grandfather Is everyone okay? prince
grandmother It sounded bad.
dwight Yeah.
michael No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
dwight You've done more then you can possibly know.
michael Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so. prince
grandfather A tow truck is going to charge you one hundred bucks to take you a mile. Let me take a look.
michael No, no, really not necessary.
dwight He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the. prince
grandfather I'll be right back I'm just going to grab my tool box.
pam Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
kevin Wait, what?
oscar See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
dwight How much longer is this going to take?
michael You know let me give you some money for this. prince
son No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands.
michael Oh coffee, that's too much.
dwight This is disgusting, what is it this, instant? prince
grandfather Well that outta do it. prince
granddaughter Its all better.
michael Thank you. prince
grandfather Gosh, well so long.
dwight I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
michael Ok, goodbye prince Family.
dwight Goodbye prince family, should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. Bye bye.
dwight 
jim I'm saying, all I'm saying is kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
pam No, because.
michael Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call david and give him this information?
dwight Its simple, david would use that information to destroy them.
michael Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
dwight They could do better.
michael Why don't we just, live and let live?
dwight What?
michael Live and let live.
dwight I'm not familiar with that expression,
michael It's from James Bond.
dwight It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
michael I'm not going to make this call.
dwight Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
michael My heart says.
dwight Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
michael That is true.
dwight Yes.
michael That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
dwight Yeah.
michael Jan. Ryan.
dwight Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
stanley I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
dwight There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
michael You're right.
dwight Yeah.
michael You are right. I will call david and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
dwight Good, so, where are you going?
michael Just something I have to do first.
dwight Where are you taking the client list?
michael Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone
dwight Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No.
michael Oh shoot!
dwight Freeze, give me the list!
dwight No no no, I can't let you do this!
michael Those people will be ruined.
dwight Its business, not personal.
michael Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
dwight Its over, Michael, its over.
michael Im not a shark.
andy Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? Okay. And all those opposed?
kevin This is ridiculous.
oscar That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place.
david This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
michael Mpfh.
david Good work.
michael Thank you.
david Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.
michael Okay, bye bye.
dwight Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
michael I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because david Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even. what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
michael Oh, hey what is this?
pam Hillary swank.
michael Oh, she is hot.
