kelly Here you go.
michael Nice dress, Ryan.
kelly It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
michael OK.
michael Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have kelly explain it it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.
kelly You look so handsome.
pam Really you do. I love the material.
kelly I know.
michael How come you didn't get me one?
kelly I.
phyllis Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
pam I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
meredith Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 's*x and the City' at my place?
pam Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
kelly I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
pam I just feel kind of tired, you know.
dwight Maybe you've got mono.
pam Maybe. I just . I don't really have anyone to go with.
kelly Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
dwight Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
kevin Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
roy I don't know. Who's. uh, who's going?
kevin Oooh. Do you mean like, is pam going?
angela Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
michael Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do. sign me up. because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
michael It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
stanley I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
michael Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
michael I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di. don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
michael Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, kelly you are on.
kelly Um. Diwali is awesome. and there's food. and there's going to be dancing. and. Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um.
michael Kelly?
kelly Sparkles.
michael Um. why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
kelly Oh, um. I don't know. It's really old, I think.
angela How many gods do you have?
kelly Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
angela And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
kevin She looks like pam from the neck down.
dwight pam wishes. Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil.
michael All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.
jim Sorry.
jim I started biking into work. josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape. helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
karen Nice basket.
jim Thank you.
michael Now, a lot of people say that kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig. '
dwight I see dead people.
michael Okay. Spoiler. alert.
dwight He was dead the whole time.
michael Just stop it. What's the. oh, whoa! Where did that come from?
tony Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms.
karen Oh. Did you shake it?
tony Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.
andy We have such a roller coaster thing, karen and I.
jim 'Scuse me?
andy Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
jim Wow.
andy From 'Cheers'.
jim Yup.
michael And another thing about the Indian people. they love s*x positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
creed I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
meredith Oh, that's what they call it.
kevin This is the best meeting we've ever had.
michael Thank you, Kevin.
angela I find this incredibly offensive.
michael Well, I find it beautiful.
angela Well, whatever kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
michael No.
toby Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
michael No, You're not going to collect them.
toby Yes.
michael No. This is delightful, charming culture.
michael My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just s*x. People. everybody does it. I'm doing it. with Carol! Probably tonight.
josh All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
karen Thanks.
josh And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
karen Got it.
jim Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation. which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
andy You guys ready to party?
jim What's that?
andy I said are you ready TO PARTY!
phyllis Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
angela I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
kevin Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
carol I thought you said this was a costume party!
michael What does that look like to you?
carol An Indian woman in a sari.
michael No one's even going to notice.
kevin Nice outfit.
michael Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
michael I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions.
angela I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
server It's all vegetarian.
angela I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
michael Oh, yuck.
carol What? Too spicy?
michael No. These s'mores are disgusting.
carol They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
michael Do you think they have any s'mores? . push;
michael All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
ryan So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
girls kelly Zach Braff
ryan What?
kelly Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
ryan They said something about Zach Braff.
kelly Don't even listen to them. They're so.
ryan No, you don't.
pam Very official.
pam I decided to come. Uh. I feel a little under-dressed. but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
dwight Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
kelly I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at! Kelly's

michael Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night? Kelly's
father Yes.
michael Wow. Kelly's
father How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
michael Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um. no, we're not married. yet! Kelly's
mom She is very fair.
michael She is. Very fair and very kind. So. um. tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
andy One. Two. Three. Shot!
jim Oh.
carol Are you okay?
michael I'm going to be. Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec. just a sec. Um. everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah. Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um. okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
crowd Awww!
