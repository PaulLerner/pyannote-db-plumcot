dwight Hey Michael?
michael Yeah.
dwight Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
michael OK, just remember to keep breathing.
dwight My cervix is ripening.
michael OK, good.
jim jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to michael through delusion.
dwight Michael! My water's breaking!
michael Oh, OK! OK!
dwight Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
michael I get a call from jan and I meet her at the hospital.
dwight Right. Highways or surface roads?
michael I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
dwight No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!
michael I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby.
dwight It's about adapting to the circumstances.
michael Andy, would you like to have my baby?
andy Yes! Yeah. Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
dwight No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa!
michael All right, OK. Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!
dwight The pressure! The pressure!
michael Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
dwight Aaaaaaaa!
michael Aaaaaaaa!
dwight Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
michael Just keep pushing.
dwight Hold me!
michael I'm right here.
dwight Cradle my head!
michael I'm right here, I'm right here.
dwight I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
michael All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.
dwight Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
michael Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late.
dwight No! I don't want natural!
michael No. You have to just push it out!
dwight OK!
michael Keep simulating.
dwight Aaaaaaaa!
michael OK!
dwight Do you have the Sharpie?!
michael Keep simulating.
dwight Do you have the Sharpie?!
michael Yes, I do!
dwight OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
michael OK.
dwight Ready?!
michael Yes.
dwight Aaaaaaaa!
michael Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
dwight Butter. Newborns are slippery.
michael Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again.
michael It is going to be the happiest day of my life.
michael Hello ladies, how's my shower going? Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
phyllis No.
michael Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry. Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?
angela Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&amp;Ms with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name "Chevy. " And this is the girl bowl, with M&amp;Ms with the name "Astird. "
phyllis That can't be right.
angela michael wrote down "Astird. "
michael She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So.
meredith Ass. turd.
michael I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this. Two bowls of M&amp;Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
michael It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is. it's so bizarre and unnatural, but. it, it happens.
phyllis Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.
kevin But Phyllis, it's not his baby.
phyllis I know, Kevin.
oscar Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
phyllis Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake.
phyllis I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
michael Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them.
phyllis Sorry.
michael Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. Pump it!
pam So you know Stacy, right?
jim Right, the one from England.
pam There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
jim Oh. Right, that style.
pam So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
jim OK.
pam Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
jim Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
pam No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
jim OK.
pam So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way. You can't reserve seats. " And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
jim No. way!
pam Yes!
jim Ha ha. That's hilarious?
pam No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested.
jim Who, Stacy?
pam No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me?
jim Uh.
pam Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting.
jim OK, I'll ta. I'll talk to you later. That was a good story.
dwight Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
andy Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here?
angela It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
andy Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
angela That's Phyllis.
andy Well -
angela Yeah, it is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert.
andy Why would that make me a pervert, I -
angela Well, it does. That's me.
andy That's not you.
angela Yes it is.
andy That's mean, come on, that's -
michael Ahoy, matey.
holly Ahoy.
michael Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
holly Good.
michael Um, listen. jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly. fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
holly Of course. Yeah.
stanley I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
jim Jan.
jan Hi, Jim!
jim What do we have here?
jan This is my baby.
jim Really.
dwight Oh no.
dwight jan had the baby and michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.
michael So this is Astird.
jan Astrid.
michael Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?
jan Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
michael I could have helped.
jan And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so.
michael Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
jan OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's.
michael No, I don't!
jan I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
michael Can I hold her?
jan Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
michael All right, OK.
michael I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion. . push;
michael Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the
office Assst.
jan trid.
michael . trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
jan Well.
michael Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. Lion King!
jan Michael, Michael, Michael, that's. yeah. that's too high. I'll take that.
michael OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
holly You OK? You seem kind of.
michael I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
michael Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
kevin Michael, the baby's already been born.
michael Uh, duh.
kevin So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
michael No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do.
kevin OK. Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
michael All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
jan Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
michael Whatta we got?
angela Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
michael Oh!
jan Thank you.
michael She already has a stroller.
kelly And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
oscar She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
dwight Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
michael OK, what else?
dwight Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.
jan Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one.
pam Hey you!
jim Hey! You busy?
pam Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
jim OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyone's just staring at her.
pam I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
jim The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
pam I can't hear anything!
jim Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
pam OK.
pam I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, jim and I would have days like this. We're just. a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick.
jan How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one.
dwight Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!
dwight Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
dwight Playtime is over!
andy So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
jan Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth. And it was really, really quite amazing.
angela You gave birth in a tub?
jan Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
kelly Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
jan Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
creed Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
jan Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.
creed Ugh.
stanley I'm done.
oscar Me too.
jan And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth.
michael Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
michael I could have helped.
jan You're sad about this. I know that, and I wish that I. but. would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
michael Uh, yeah.
jan All right. Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes. I'm exhausted, so um. Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529. Wake me in twenty.
michael I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt. shortchanged.
michael Phyllis? Could you take-.
michael Hey guys.
darryl What's up, Mike?
michael Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
darryl You a baby daddy?
michael Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
darryl Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby.
michael I just saw this baby daddy-
darryl You should stop calling yourself "baby daddy. "
michael Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
darryl Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
michael Well-
darryl You feel connected to his baby over there?
michael It's- that's different.
darryl You feel connected to this?
michael That's not a baby.
darryl You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
michael Could I?
darryl No.
jan Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
holly I can imagine.
jan Where's Astrid?
holly Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
jan On a what?
holly Waaa! More paper! Waaa! No, she's just on a coffee break.
jan That's funny.
holly She's with Angela.
angela That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready?
andy OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook!
angela Now. Come on, up here!
andy Look up here!
angela Your hand's in it.
andy What? Sorry.
angela Yeah, that's a good one.
jan What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
andy We're taking a picture.
jan There you are.
andy She's nature's bounty.
jan You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that?
jan Michael, I need your help.
michael I was just going to. I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
jan Uh. come on.
dwight I like to call this. the bumper test.
michael Sure you can't stay a little longer?
jan Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
michael All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. jan and Astrid are leaving.
jan You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
dwight Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
jan Ah. Thanks, Dwight.
jan OK. You know what? There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
michael OK?
jan Don't date Holly.
michael Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
jan Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you. soon.
michael All right.
jan OK.
holly You still gonna be mean to me?
michael You wanna go out?
holly Yes.
michael I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
jim Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message.
pam Hi.
pam Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message.
jim Hey, it's me. It is 5
 03.
pam I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but.
jim You must be out or something.
pam I'll leave a message.
jim Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
pam I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better.
jim Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
pam I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
jim Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
pam And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
jim Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.
pam You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm. headed to my dorm. Not home.
jim Wish you were home. Uh, anyway.
pam Anyway, um. I miss you.
jim I miss you.
