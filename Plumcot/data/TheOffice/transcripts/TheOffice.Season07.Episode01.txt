creed_bratton You got Creed.
ryan_howard -and you jump in front of them.
kelly_kapoor You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
stanley_hudson Still behind.
angela_martin I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
andy_bernard Go, go, go, go!
michael_scott
all@ Streamers!
dwight_schrute Hiya! Ha!
phyllis_vance Dwight!
stanley_hudson Are you crazy?
andy_bernard Toby, how did we do?
toby_flenderson Well, that was better.
andy_bernard Whoo! We did it!
michael_scott I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.
andy_bernard Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
erin_hannon Yes, of course.
andy_bernard And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
erin_hannon Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
gabe_lewis Hey, guys.
andy_bernard Hey!
gabe_lewis Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
andy_bernard Not at all.
gabe_lewis I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao.
gabe_lewis I started dating Erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
erin_hannon Gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but... it's been great.
andy_bernard Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
pam_beesly Hey. What are you doing?
dwight_schrute From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
kevin_malone Well, what if you're cold?
dwight_schrute Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear.
dwight_schrute Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
kelly_kapoor This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, "Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?" And I'd be like, "blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah," giving you the exact right answer.
luke_cooper Coffee Monkey's arrived.
oscar_martinez The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
luke_cooper Here you go, Big O. Tiny. Darryl Hannah.
darryl_philbin It says decaf. You get me decaf?
luke_cooper Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?
darryl_philbin My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
andy_bernard New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
luke_cooper My name is Luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are Citizen Kane and The Boondock Saints.
andy_bernard That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
michael_scott He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. Ah! It's not cappuccino.
oscar_martinez He messed yours up to.
darryl_philbin He's got to go, Mike.
michael_scott It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
jim_halpert Wow, that's a lot of keys.
dwight_schrute The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
jim_halpert That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
dwight_schrute Where?
jim_halpert I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these.
dwight_schrute Give me that.
jim_halpert Yep. Wait, and this.
dwight_schrute Yes.
jim_halpert Go get 'em.
jim_halpert What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
dwight_schrute Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
pam_beesly Sorry.
jim_halpert Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
pam_beesly It was really funny.
jim_halpert Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
pam_beesly I love you.
phyllis_vance Luke? Luke!
luke_cooper What's up, Venus?
phyllis_vance Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
luke_cooper Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe.
meredith_palmer Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
luke_cooper You don't have to yell.
michael_scott Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
luke_cooper What for?
michael_scott To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
michael_scott And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
michael_scott Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
michael_scott Don't bother Luke.
pam_beesly Why is there a circle with a line through it?
michael_scott That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
phyllis_vance Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
michael_scott No, it... Yes, okay, right. All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go.
darryl_philbin Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
michael_scott Come on. Okay, um... That's as clear as I can make it.
phyllis_vance Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
michael_scott Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
dwight_schrute Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
gabe_lewis That'd be hilarious. Uh, "Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em."
michael_scott Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
dwight_schrute How close?
michael_scott Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
dwight_schrute Yes. Of course.
toby_flenderson Guys, I think Michael and Luke are related.
michael_scott No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.
all@ What?
michael_scott Luke is my nephew.
oscar_martinez Michael, that's nepotism. Luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
michael_scott Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
darryl_philbin What's wrong with a level playing field?
michael_scott Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
jim_halpert Oh, man, so many points being made.
creed_bratton I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat.
michael_scott God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
erin_hannon That's a really tight argument.
michael_scott Thank you.
jim_halpert But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.
michael_scott No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
oscar_martinez This is hypothetical. We're talking about Luke who happens to be terrible.
michael_scott Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
kelly_kapoor I would just like to say something off of what Darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
oscar_martinez If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
michael_scott Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
erin_hannon Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
michael_scott Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
kevin_malone Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
pam_beesly Or enough for everyone?
luke_cooper No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips.
oscar_martinez Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
andy_bernard Clutch cream run, bro.
pam_beesly Get whatever you want, on me.
jim_halpert You really think you can make it up to me with food?
pam_beesly I don't know. That usually works.
pam_beesly I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
angela_martin I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
michael_scott Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
phyllis_vance Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
michael_scott All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
jim_halpert Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, "I don't own an Ebay store," so...
michael_scott Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
oscar_martinez Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
stanley_hudson Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
erin_hannon Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
michael_scott I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
andy_bernard You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.
michael_scott Wait a minute.
meredith_palmer I'm in.
michael_scott Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
oscar_martinez Yep, here they are.
phyllis_vance Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
andy_bernard This kid's costing us sales, Michael.
erin_hannon I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
michael_scott No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.
jo_bennett Why is this my problem, Michael?
michael_scott Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
gabe_lewis Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
jo_bennett Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy.
michael_scott You don't have all the facts.
jo_bennett Which are?
michael_scott I love him.
jo_bennett Oh, God. How far has it gone?
michael_scott No. No. He's my nephew.
jo_bennett Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house.
michael_scott Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
jo_bennett If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.
michael_scott I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
jo_bennett Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.
michael_scott Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.
kevin_malone Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
pam_beesly Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "Doors closed" the doors open. Or he presses "lobby" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
kevin_malone Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
pam_beesly Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
dwight_schrute Hey, did you SMS text message me?
pam_beesly Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
dwight_schrute Okay, that's weird. Just hitting "door closed." What?
pam_beesly There we go.
dwight_schrute Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
pam_beesly Let's just calm down.
dwight_schrute Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
pam_beesly I don't-
dwight_schrute Use your talons! Pry 'em open!
pam_beesly Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
dwight_schrute Well, don't look, freak!
pam_beesly Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
dwight_schrute I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
pam_beesly You've gotta be kidding me.
michael_scott Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
luke_cooper What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said.
michael_scott Give me the pointer.
luke_cooper So you just want me to move it? You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it.
michael_scott No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
luke_cooper All right, fine. Fine. I'll just go.
michael_scott Okay.
luke_cooper I'm gone.
michael_scott All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
andy_bernard Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
angela_martin Michael, do something.
meredith_palmer Sack up, man.
michael_scott Okay, can I have that?
luke_cooper No.
michael_scott Ok, I am going to count down from five.
all@ Five, four...
michael_scott I'm not kidding.
all@ Three, two, one.
michael_scott Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
luke_cooper No!
michael_scott You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
luke_cooper What the?
michael_scott That's what you're going to do, Luke!
luke_cooper What the hell was that?
michael_scott I had to do that.
luke_cooper Hey, this! Screw it!
michael_scott All right. Are we good? You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
kevin_malone That was awesome!
stanley_hudson Texas justice.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
creed_bratton He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
jim_halpert You follow him on Twitter?
creed_bratton Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
gabe_lewis Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
michael_scott Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
jim_halpert Pam?
pam_beesly Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
jim_halpert I did not do this.
pam_beesly I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
jim_halpert This is impressive.
pam_beesly Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
jim_halpert Do they call you that?
pam_beesly They do call me that.
jim_halpert Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
pam_beesly Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
jim_halpert Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Great.
dwight_schrute How ya doin'?
jim_halpert Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
pam_beesly Stop drinking the water! Stop!
andy_bernard No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
michael_scott Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.
andy_bernard Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
gabe_lewis Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst. You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
michael_scott That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
gabe_lewis Good. Well, that's the spirit.
michael_scott I can do that.
gabe_lewis And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
michael_scott Okay. Wait, what?
toby_flenderson Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
michael_scott Is there another option?
gabe_lewis The alternative is termination.
