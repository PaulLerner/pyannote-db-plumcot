erin_hannon The tea in Nepal is very hot.
kevin_malone But the coffee in Peru is much hotter.
dwight_schrute Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they're protecting America's real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day's security codes. Something that's been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It's not the KGB, but it's a start.
erin_hannon The tea in Nepal is very hot.
dwight_schrute But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
erin_hannon Close.
dwight_schrute This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
erin_hannon Colder.
dwight_schrute The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
erin_hannon No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, "the coffee in Peru is much hotter."
dwight_schrute Ah, much, ok.
erin_hannon But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. Unless you want me to break protocol?
dwight_schrute No, no. Give me the steam.
dwight_schrute It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
dwight_schrute Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
creed_bratton Oh, I'm saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
Philip#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 Mama!
oscar_martinez Angela, someone wants you.
angela_martin Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
oscar_martinez Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it's Angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o.
oscar_martinez Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
esther Go get ‘em, honey.
dwight_schrute Oh, don't worry. They'll get got.
dwight_schrute Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check... on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.
andy_bernard Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that's premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
Check-in#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 guy Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.
andy_bernard Yes!
andy_bernard Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It's a really cool show, it's like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
jim_halpert Sales form for you to sign.
dwight_schrute You know what to do. Ok
dwight_schrute Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
jim_halpert Aw, thanks, man.
dwight_schrute Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War—
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
jim_halpert Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
pam_beesly Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
jim_halpert All depends on the conference room meeting itself. Uh, okay.
pam_beesly Is that them again?
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Maybe you should call back?
jim_halpert I will. I will.
jim_halpert The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that's final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I'm not risking that again.
pam_beesly When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
dwight_schrute Welcome.
jim_halpert He welcomes you.
dwight_schrute Please take an agenda item.
jim_halpert Your agenda-taking pleases him.
dwight_schrute Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. "Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try." That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
jim_halpert Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, "Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future." Ok? That's nonsense.
pam_beesly Question.
jim_halpert Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
pam_beesly We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, "Nice jugs"?
jim_halpert That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
all@ Zero. No nonsense. You can't have nonsense.
dwight_schrute What is going on?
angela_martin Daycare won't take Phillip anymore.
oscar_martinez Why?
angela_martin Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi.
oscar_martinez Hi, buddy.
dwight_schrute Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
jim_halpert Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited?
meredith_palmer I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap.
stanley_hudson Over the course of this documentary I've had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble my wife did it.
dwight_schrute I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
kevin_malone Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
oscar_martinez I can't believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having s*x with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
creed_bratton This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
andy_bernard This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
casey_dean Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.
andy_bernard No!
casey_dean America wants it!
andy_bernard No, this is my time! You don't belt on my time! I belt on my time.
casey_dean Casey Dean!
andy_bernard Casey Dean!
casey_dean Man, those are some nice pipes.
andy_bernard Yeah.
casey_dean What's your name?
andy_bernard Andy. What's yours?
angela_martin Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
oscar_martinez Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
kevin_malone Guys.
angela_martin Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
kevin_malone Guys.
angela_martin Why don't you pack it?
kevin_malone Guys.
angela_martin & Oscar Kevin, what?
kevin_malone Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says "bold front" instead of "cold front"? It's insane.
angela_martin Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
oscar_martinez Seriously, Kevin. I'm just gonna have to go to the store.
angela_martin Ok, you go to the store.
kevin_malone Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
dwight_schrute Not now! Private time!
jim_halpert I love Star Wars as much as the next guy—
dwight_schrute Hey, hey! Seriously?
jim_halpert My god, I'm so sorry. Well this might make up for it I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
dwight_schrute Which is, of course...
jim_halpert Potential future nonsense.
dwight_schrute Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
jim_halpert I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager.
dwight_schrute The power source.
jim_halpert Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
dwight_schrute A loyal, but bungling apostle.
jim_halpert But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
dwight_schrute Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
jim_halpert Exactly.
dwight_schrute I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
jim_halpert Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests.
dwight_schrute I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
jim_halpert Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
dwight_schrute That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard.
casey_dean What're you listening to?
andy_bernard Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
casey_dean Oh, sweet.
andy_bernard A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
mark_mcgrath McGrath What's up, everybody? And welcome to America's Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!
casey_dean Ah! It's Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You're gorgeous!
mark_mcgrath McGrath Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!
andy_bernard There's a mole?
mark_mcgrath McGrath Oops. I'm not supposed to—I'm not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?
andy_bernard What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
mark_mcgrath McGrath Good man right there. I'll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?
andy_bernard Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
casey_dean What? On a roll much?
andy_bernard I don't know where it came from.
casey_dean That was amazing, man!
andy_bernard Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
casey_dean Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.
andy_bernard I did, I felt it.
casey_dean Big time.
pam_beesly What are you so excited about?
jim_halpert Nothing.
pam_beesly What are you up to?
jim_halpert Members of the office, hear ye.
dwight_schrute That means ye, Plop!
pete_miller Plop? Still?
dwight_schrute We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
pete_miller Fine.
jim_halpert Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
erin_hannon Aw, heck ya!
pam_beesly Nice.
dwight_schrute You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
jim_halpert This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring.
dwight_schrute Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
jim_halpert He envies you.
dwight_schrute You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it.
jim_halpert Alright.
jim_halpert By 2 00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
darryl_philbin What up?
toby_flenderson What's going on? How was the delivery?
darryl_philbin Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I'm here.
darryl_philbin I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
jim_halpert A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
meredith_palmer Uh, two.
jim_halpert 985,000,000,000,017.
dwight_schrute Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
jim_halpert Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
pam_beesly Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
jim_halpert Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
dwight_schrute Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job.
jim_halpert That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
pete_miller A horse.
jim_halpert Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
pete_miller What's the opposite of a horse?
jim_halpert Come on.
jim_halpert & Dwight Sea horse.
jim_halpert Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna—
jim_halpert & Dwight Say that? Uncanny.
jim_halpert Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
clark Yeah.
jim_halpert Do you want a corn dog?
clark I would love a corn dog.
jim_halpert We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
clark Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went."
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations.
jim_halpert Uncanny.
Soldier#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they'll feel like anything is possible.
andy_bernard Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
casey_dean Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.
andy_bernard What?
casey_dean Yeah.
andy_bernard Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
casey_dean I don't know. But I'm getting really worried here.
andy_bernard Me too. Hold my place in line.
casey_dean Where are you going?
andy_bernard They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
darryl_philbin Thanks, man.
hank Thank you.
darryl_philbin Yep. Take care.
pam_beesly Darryl, hey.
darryl_philbin Hey.
pam_beesly Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
darryl_philbin No, no, I'm not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn't say goodbye to.
pam_beesly Aha. How's Athlead?
darryl_philbin We livin' like rock stars. I'm about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
pam_beesly Wow.
darryl_philbin Jim really doesn't want to come?
pam_beesly He says he doesn't want to.
darryl_philbin Wow. Man. I hope he doesn't regret it.
pam_beesly Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
darryl_philbin Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
pam_beesly That's what he says.
darryl_philbin If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
jim_halpert An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
dwight_schrute A thousand times more.
phyllis_vance I'll try this one.
jim_halpert Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
phyllis_vance Hot!
jim_halpert Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
dwight_schrute No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
jim_halpert Look at that form.
dwight_schrute Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
jim_halpert Uncanny.
erin_hannon Darryl?! Darryl!
kevin_malone Whoa.
darryl_philbin Oh, hey. Hey, what's up, y'all?
erin_hannon You left us without saying goodbye.
darryl_philbin Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
meredith_palmer Hey! No way!
kevin_malone That's totally uncool.
erin_hannon Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
darryl_philbin I don't think I sh-
erin_hannon Get upstairs, mister!
meredith_palmer Yeah!
kevin_malone Right. Now.
darryl_philbin Guess I'm going upstairs.
jim_halpert You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing—none of these people are good enough.
dwight_schrute I know.
jim_halpert What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said.
dwight_schrute Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
jim_halpert Is-
dwight_schrute Me.
jim_halpert The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
dwight_schrute Yes! Thank you.
jim_halpert I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. That's it. You look really, really good.
dwight_schrute Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert You all right? What's going on?
pam_beesly Are you happy?
jim_halpert Yes, I'm happy.
pam_beesly No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly What about five years from now?
jim_halpert Pam.
pam_beesly Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just—I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much.
jim_halpert This was my decision, not yours.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert You didn't force me.
pam_beesly I kind of forced you to do it.
jim_halpert You did not force me to do this.
pam_beesly Yes, I did.
jim_halpert I don't know how else to tell you.
pam_beesly I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that—
jim_halpert Resent you?
pam_beesly This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you.
jim_halpert Is that really what you think?
jim_halpert Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys.
Camera#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 Crew Okay. You got it, man.
darryl_philbin I didn't realize we were this close.
phyllis_vance We're all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
meredith_palmer Are you gonna come to Poor Richard's and watch with us tonight?
darryl_philbin Uh... yeah. Depending on traffic.
stanley_hudson He ain't coming.
erin_hannon Oh, god!
darryl_philbin These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
darryl_philbin Well, it's been great.
phyllis_vance Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he's gone for who knows how long.
darryl_philbin Maybe forever. Anyhow—
oscar_martinez Did we ever have lunch together, just—just the two of us? You know what, I'm gonna make reservations right now at Cugino's.
meredith_palmer Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
darryl_philbin Oh, oh, I'm sure we did.
meredith_palmer Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
clark Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
erin_hannon Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl's next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we'll get this started.
darryl_philbin Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you're feeling sentimental.
meredith_palmer You have to!
darryl_philbin Hey, hey, hey. I'll do one thing with y'all.
phyllis_vance Which thing?
darryl_philbin I don't care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
angela_martin Kevin, Kevin.
kevin_malone Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking.
angela_martin Kevin, could you not do that?
kevin_malone What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
oscar_martinez Here, use my pen.
kevin_malone Don't tell me what to do!
angela_martin & Oscar Shhh!
kevin_malone No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me.
angela_martin Kevin, where are you going?
kevin_malone Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
oscar_martinez He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper.
angela_martin I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
dwight_schrute Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.
andy_bernard Hey, what's goin' on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young'uns?
casey_dean You're back!
andy_bernard No, it's me, Andy!
casey_dean No, I know.
andy_bernard No, no, no. I'm wearing makeup.
casey_dean You did a really great job. You even look shorter.
andy_bernard Oh, I took out my lifts.
casey_dean Oh.
andy_bernard Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
casey_dean Oh.
esther All day long, it's moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
dwight_schrute Oink the pigs, that is very important.
esther Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
dwight_schrute The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Esther.
esther Bye.
jim_halpert You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
dwight_schrute I need you to perform a test.
jim_halpert Perform a test.
dwight_schrute On an innocent baby.
jim_halpert Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz.
dwight_schrute Damn straight.
jim_halpert Unless you think he can't handle it.
dwight_schrute Hey, he can handle it.
jim_halpert All right.
oscar_martinez Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley's sleeping. You don't want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
stanley_hudson I heard that.
Phillip#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 Mama.
dwight_schrute Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
pam_beesly He does have a gift.
oscar_martinez Well, he's calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Phillip#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 Mama.
dwight_schrute Okay. You ever been in a manager's office before?
dwight_schrute Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called "Schrute or Consequences." You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
Phillip#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 Beet.
dwight_schrute Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Check-in#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 guy Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions.
all@ in line Oh come on! Hey!
andy_bernard Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Check-in#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 guy But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America's Next A Cappella Sensa—
andy_bernard Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't do that. You can't do that, we've all been waiting.
Check-in#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 guy Okay.
andy_bernard I am going in there! Don't—
Check-in#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 guy No, you're not, sir.
andy_bernard Don't—don't—
Check-in#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 guy Please don't.
andy_bernard Don't touch me.
Check-in#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode22 guy I'm not touching you. Okay?
casey_dean Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don't you dare. Don't get—I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I'm Casey Dean! You'll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won't be seeing the last of me!
oscar_martinez Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
dwight_schrute That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
kevin_malone He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.
andy_bernard Hi. You're still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You're like, my three favorite people ever.
santigold What is this?
andy_bernard Sweetheart, you're amazing, okay? You're obviously gonna be on the show, so it's someone else's turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, my name is Ezra Cornell and I'm just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
aaron_rodgers Rodgers No, you're a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.
andy_bernard Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
clay_aiken Aiken No, we do not want to hear you sing.
santigold Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.
andy_bernard Nope! Can't end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss's car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
aaron_rodgers Rodgers Flag on the play.
andy_bernard That's—that's what—yeah. Okay, all right, well, here's the song. Far above Cayuga's waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater—
santigold What is this song?
andy_bernard Are you insane? It's the Cornell fight song.
clay_aiken Aiken Listen, all right, thank you very much, we're not interested.
andy_bernard You didn't let me finish. That's not fair.
aaron_rodgers Rodgers Look, man, you're not terrible. We've heard a lot of really good singers today and you're just not good enough.
andy_bernard Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that's the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
aaron_rodgers Rodgers Can he do this?
andy_bernard Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you're never fully dressed without a smile. Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly—
santigold Look, you gotta go. You can't just sit here and cry.
andy_bernard Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
jim_halpert Thank you.
oscar_martinez Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
kevin_malone Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
oscar_martinez Okay, I guess, it's just that Phillip got you something.
angela_martin Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
oscar_martinez I think there's, like, $7 left.
angela_martin It's just his way of saying, "Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting."
kevin_malone Phillip got this for me?
oscar_martinez Sure.
kevin_malone That was a really cool move.
angela_martin Would you like to hold Phillip? Yeah. That's Kevin.
kevin_malone Whoa.
oscar_martinez Easy.
kevin_malone What a chubbers. Whoa.
angela_martin Okay, watch it.
kevin_malone I'm losing my balance.
angela_martin No, Kevin, no.
oscar_martinez Hey, no.
kevin_malone Whoa!
oscar_martinez No horseplay.
angela_martin Stop it.
kevin_malone You wanna play with the cactus?
angela_martin No, no!
kevin_malone So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we're gonna be best friends. He's a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
erin_hannon We have our decision.
darryl_philbin You chose one thing?
erin_hannon We want to dance with you.
darryl_philbin You want to dance?
erin_hannon One dance, all of us together.
darryl_philbin This is what you want?
erin_hannon Absolutely.
darryl_philbin Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we're gonna do this right.
erin_hannon Yes!
angela_martin Hey. You wanted to see me?
dwight_schrute Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.
angela_martin I am sorry he's here today but I had—
dwight_schrute I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
angela_martin How thoughtful.
dwight_schrute Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.
angela_martin If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son.
dwight_schrute Very well.
angela_martin Can I go back to my desk now?
dwight_schrute Yes.
pam_beesly What is this?
jim_halpert Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so I needed a little help.
dwight_schrute Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
jim_halpert OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
dwight_schrute Now.
jim_halpert I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
dwight_schrute Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.
pam_beesly Go ahead.
jim_halpert Ok, um, this is... —I'll be right back.
jim_halpert What do we got?
dwight_schrute I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
jim_halpert Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step.
dwight_schrute She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest.
jim_halpert Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.
dwight_schrute Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
jim_halpert That's a lot of pros.
dwight_schrute And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
jim_halpert So what is the problem?
dwight_schrute Angela.
jim_halpert I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
dwight_schrute Some sort of virus?
jim_halpert Love.
dwight_schrute Oh.
jim_halpert Dwight, listen no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
dwight_schrute You're a good assistant, Jim.
jim_halpert Not as good as you.
dwight_schrute That's very true. Get the hell outta here.
jim_halpert You got it.
jim_halpert You watched it.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Well, then I guess you're ready for this.
pam_beesly What's that?
jim_halpert It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know is in that note. Not enough for me? You are everything.
pam_beesly Thank you.
erin_hannon Ok, everybody ready?
phyllis_vance Hit it, red!
darryl_philbin I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I'm gonna miss these guys.
oscar_martinez Ok, I've got my—
meredith_palmer See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right?
oscar_martinez All right, Meredith.
angela_martin Okay, bye.
oscar_martinez See you there.
kevin_malone Bye, Phillip. High five.
oscar_martinez Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother's, and I'll meet you at Poor Richard's in an hour.
angela_martin Are you sure you don't want me to drop him off?
oscar_martinez She doesn't know I'm living with a straight woman. I don't want to get her hopes up.
angela_martin All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
oscar_martinez Oh, my goodness.
dwight_schrute Pull over!
angela_martin Dwight?
dwight_schrute Move to the side of the road!
angela_martin Why?
dwight_schrute Pull over!
angela_martin What do you—Dwight!
angela_martin Dwight! What the is your problem!
dwight_schrute Shut up, woman!
angela_martin Who drives like that?
dwight_schrute Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
angela_martin Can you put that down?
dwight_schrute This expresses how loudly I love you.
angela_martin It's too loud.
dwight_schrute This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
angela_martin Okay, yes—yes, I will! I love you!
dwight_schrute I love you!
angela_martin And I lied to you.
dwight_schrute What?
angela_martin Phillip's your son.
dwight_schrute What? Why would you say that—
angela_martin I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
dwight_schrute Get out! I'm a dad!
angela_martin You're a dad!
creed_bratton Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor's up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. Oh!
erin_hannon You have to change the channel to PBS.
kevin_malone Yeah.
the_bartender College baseball is on.
erin_hannon But there's a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
the_bartender What's it about?
erin_hannon A paper company.
the_bartender How many people want the game? Who wants PBS? Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.
kevin_malone Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
andy_bernard One more for the doc.
the_bartender All right.
kevin_malone Yes!
clark Hey, how was the singing show audition?
andy_bernard Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
creed_bratton Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!
kevin_malone I feel scared a little.
phyllis_vance Yeah, I'm not ready for this.
stanley_hudson No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is.
oscar_martinez One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
jim_halpert Here we go.
