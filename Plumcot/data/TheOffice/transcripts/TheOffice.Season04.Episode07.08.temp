michael Coat!
pam michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
michael Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
pam He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
michael Get me Armani.
pam A suit?
michael On the phone.
pam Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
michael Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are.
michael I owe you an apology.
pam You finished the movie.
michael Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
pam No. Go ahead.
michael Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
pam Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby. He's gonna try to kill me.
micahel So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.
jan You do.
michael I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
jan Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
michael We already have a sofa. So why do---
jan A futon's not a sofa.
michael It. folds up. You've only seen it flat.
jan I know what a futon is, Michael.
michael I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
jan It costs what it costs.
michae No--- don't. that doesn't even mean anything.
jan We have gone through this.
michael Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
michael It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs---
pam Michael, it's ryan for you.
jan Conniving little runt. Put him through.
michael Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
ryan I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
michael Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
ryan I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
michael Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
ryan Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
michael Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
jim Sure, I can hold.
dwight Dunder Mifflin, dwight Schrute. Please hold. Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
jim Hey Dwight.
dwight None of your business, Jim.
jim Do you run the bed and breakfest?
dwight It is not a B and B.
dwight Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
jim Does the Department of Health know about this?
dwight I'm not telling you anything. Permits are pending. dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
pam Hello, I'm looking for a room.
dwight Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
pam It says here you cater to the eldery.
dwight Where did you read that?
pam Trip Advsior.
dwight Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
dwight How many in your party?
pam Two?
dwight We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
jan So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
michael Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
jan Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
michael Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
dwight One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
angela What about my cherub figurine?
dwight You took that with you.
angela No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
dwight You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
angela Fine.
dwight My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has s*x with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
kevin The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
michael You can not, I have a thing tonight.
kevin Dammit.
jim Uh, Michael.
michael What?
jim That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
michael Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
jim Darn it!
pam Shoot!
michael How about this weekend?
jim No, can't.
pam We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
michael Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
jim Where are you going out tonight?
michael You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
jim I wouldn't understand or a secret?
pam You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.
michael I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy.
jim I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
pam The Beets Motel.
jim The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
pam Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
jim How are you doing this?
pam I don't know!
pam Oh my gosh.
michael I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
nick What's going on here?
michael Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
nick We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---
michael No, they're with me, so. this is nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
dwight We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
pam What are the themes?
dwight American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
pam Irrigation.
jim Nice.
dwight I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
jim Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
dwight No.
jim Not even Harry Potter?
dwight No. Jim, come on.
mose But you promised.
dwight Mose, bags! Now!
dwight Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
nick Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.
michael These meetings are useless.
nick I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?
michael Very inspirational.
nick We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok. Co-Worker 1
 Or a woman.
michael Or a trained seal.
nick You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok?
jim Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
pam What?
jim Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
jim You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine. uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just. less.
dwight Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
michael Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
stanely Yes, who is this?
michael I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
stanely Michael?
michael . Stanley?
stanley Why are you calling me here at home?
michael Senor, are you happy with your---
stanley Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
michael Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
stanley Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home?
stanley When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of michael Scott.
michael Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
nick My office.
michael You bet.
nick Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation.
michael Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
nick A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
michael It is not a waste of our time.
nick This is a trading game.
micael No.
nick You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how vikram does it.
michael vikram doesn't have my people skills.
nick Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night.
michael Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
dwight And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
michael What did you get tonight?
vikram Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.
michael Oh, that looks good.
vikram Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?
michael I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
vikram Enjoy.
michael Thank you.
vikram I was a surgeon back home.
michael Really?
vikram Oh yeah.
michael Wonder what I would've been back home?
vikram Well this is your home.
michael I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
vikram Uhh, no.
michael I would've been chief of surgery. Or a cowboy.
jim Wait, you're going up there?
pam Yeah. Coward.
pam Oh my God. What century is this?
michael You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator. Co-Worker 2
 Dude, you should review movies.
michael I actually wrote a movie. Co-Worker 3
 Really?
michael I'm writing one, yeah. Co-Worker 3
 What's it about?
michael Um, sort of a spy, thriller.
nick What's so captivating? I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking.
pam Ugh, your turn.
dwight Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
jim Hey Dwight.
dwight Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
jim Does mose have nightmares?
jim Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
dwight Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
jim Yeah, yeah.
dwight Great.
jim Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
dwight Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
jim Good night, Dwight. Co-Worker 2
 Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come? Co-Worker 3
 We'd love for you to come, Michael.
michael Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning. Co-Worker 2
 All right, next time dude.
michael Okay, see you guys. Hey, how you doin'?
jan You drive, I had too much wine.
michael Okay. How's yoga?
jan I didn't go.
michael Wh-Why not?
jan I just didn't!
michael Okay.
jan How was improv?
michael Good night Vikram.
vikram Good night.
michael Hey, congrats on the bonus.
vikram Thank you Michael.
michael I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
vikram Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah.
michael Good night.
vikram Good night.
pam Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
dwight Pam.
jim You okay?
dwight I am better than you have ever been or ever will be.
ryan Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
ryan Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
michael Um. that wasn't much of an introduction.
ryan Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, michael Scott.
michael Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking. about. PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
michael Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery. . push;
michael And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
ryan Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
michael Why?
ryan You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
michael No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
ryan I'm your boss.
michael My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
ryan You have another job?
michael What I do between 5
 30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
jim Are you a cocktail waitress?
ryan You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
michael It won't.
ryan It did, all ready.
michael Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.
kelly You're so funny.
ryan Why is darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
kelly I invited him.
ryan It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
darryl There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
kelly Okay.
darryl Hey, get off.
kelly Umm, see you later tonight.
darryl I have plans later.
kelly Okay, bye honey.
ryan How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
michael Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
ryan You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
michael Huh, okay.
ryan What?
michael It's whoever, not whomever.
ryan No, it's whomever.
michael No, whomever is never actually right.
jim No, sometimes its right.
creed michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
andy No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
oscar Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
michael Not a native speaker.
kevin I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
ryan Do you really know which one is correct?
kevin I don't know.
pam It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
phyllis Yeah, that sounds right.
michael Well it sounds right, but is it?
stanley How did ryan use it? As an object?
ryan As an object.
kelly ryan used me an object.
stanley Is he right about that?
pam How did he use it again?
toby It was ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
michael Thank you.
toby To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
michael No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
ryan Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
michael I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history.
michael Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company--- Mr.
figaro Lipophedrine
michael And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin. Mr.
figaro Never heard of it.
michael In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this. Mr.
figaro Are you quitting?
michael I am. Mr.
figaro Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.
michael I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
andy So.
pam What's up?
andy Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
pam You're being gross.
andy Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
pam What moves?
andy I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
pam I can't believe that's not working.
andy Yeah.
pam Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
andy Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
pam She's very religious.
andy Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
pam Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
andy Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
pam That's right, you did.
andy Yeah.
pam Now that I think about it, angela and andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight. or Angela. or Andy.
michael Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
kevin I do gamble Michael.
michael Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?
kevin The mob.
michael Do you know anybody in the mob?
kevin 
michael Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
kelly What do you mean you have plans tonight?
darryl I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
kelly Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
darryl My daughter.
kelly Okay, I see how it is. Oops.
darryl That was cold.
kelly 
phyllis He's always been terrible with money.
stanley I bet it's jan spending him straight to the poor house.
kevin Yeah, women be shoppin'.
meredith I can't believe he has a second job.
oscar He's not even good at his first one.
michael Hey guys.
kevin Shh.
michael What'cha talking about? Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about jim and Pam, if they're having s*x, what it looks like, I know, I think---
pam Michael.
michael Hey, hey, hey.
oscar Michael, are you having money problems?
michael Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?
oscar You heard me correctly.
michael Oh, I hate monkeys.
pam What's going on, why do you have a second job?
michael I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
pam Doesn't jan have money?
michael I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.
kevin True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
michael I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? oscar and
stanley You just put it back in your pocket.
michael Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
darryl Hey, let's call this what it is.
darryl It's like she only wants to hook up when ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
kelly Well, I just need to know where this is going.
darryl Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
kelly Don't you dare walk away from me darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
darryl Slow down, think it over.
kelly darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?
creed Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
michael No you didn't.
creed Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
creed creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
michael How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
creed You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands.
michael That is a good point.
creed Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
michael Like the witness protection program.
creed Exactly.
oscar Not at all.
michael I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.
michael I. DECLARE. BANKRUPTCY!
oscar Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
michael I didn't say it, I declared it.
oscar Still, that's not anything.
oscar This is a lot of credit card debt.
michael Yeah, tell me about it.
oscar Mmm.
michael You know, jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
oscar Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
michael Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
oscar Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
michael That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.
andy I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game.
oscar Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
michael Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
oscar The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
michael Right.
oscar This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
michael How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?
pam Man, angela really had a hold on him. Angela.
oscar Michael, I'm going to set you and jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
michael No, no, we are going to leave jan out of this.
oscar She has to know.
michael We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
oscar Michael, this is a presentation tool.
michael You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell jan about this.
oscar I'm done!
michael No you're not! Ok, just. you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
oscar jan is smart.
michael She poses.
jim Dwight, how's the hotel business?
dwight Stupid.
jim Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
dwight No.
jim Maybe you should.
dwight Maybe you should. Whatever.
pam We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
jim The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
pam Table making never seemed so possible.
jim You will never want to leave your room.
pam The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
dwight I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
pam We really did. It was fun.
oscar So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
jan You're broke?
michael Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
jan Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say.
oscar Jan.
jan Yeah, what?
oscar michael left.
jan Okay, where did he go?
oscar I don't know.
jan Well, is he coming right back?
oscar I don't think so.
jan I'll be right there.
michael What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
angela You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
pam Dwight.
dwight Uhh-mmm
jim Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
dwight No you didn't.
jim Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.
dwight Mmm-uh-mm
jim Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
dwight 
pam Hey, I was thinking about dinner---
jim Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
pam Okay.
jim Yeah?
pam Yeah.
jim Okay.
pam Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
jim Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
oscar Jan, he went running that way.
jan Alright.
michael Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.
jan Michael.
michael Hey Jan.
jan What's going on?
michael Not much, what's up with you?
jan Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?
michael I'm out of answers Jan.
jan What does that mean?
michael I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.
jan Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that.
michael I don't know that.
jan Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
michael I'll stay off the grid.
jan Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad.
michael Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.
jan Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
michael That's really nice of you to say.
