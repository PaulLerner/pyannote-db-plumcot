karen_filippelli Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
karen_filippelli Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
jim_halpert Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
jim_halpert I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."
dwight_schrute No! You'll thank me later.
michael_scott There she is - Jan Levinson. First...
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Yes.
jan_levinson I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
michael_scott I don't understand.
jan_levinson The board voted last night to close your branch.
michael_scott On whom's authority?
jan_levinson The board's.
michael_scott What?
jan_levinson I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
michael_scott You're welcome.
jan_levinson A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
michael_scott Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
jan_levinson Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
michael_scott Oh... Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
jan_levinson Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.
michael_scott Well...
jan_levinson It's... it's about talent.
michael_scott Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
jan_levinson Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
michael_scott Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
michael_scott It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
michael_scott Pictures. Memories. Look at that. They grow up so fast.
dwight_schrute Hey stranger.
michael_scott Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
dwight_schrute Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
michael_scott Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
dwight_schrute When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, "Something Weird is Going On." Colon, "What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute."
karen_filippelli Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is...
jim_halpert Really? Wow... that's bad.
andy_bernard Um, sorry... the Scranton branch is closing? In your face!
jim_halpert Well, I work here now.
andy_bernard Mmmm.. suck-ah!
pam_beesly Are you okay?
michael_scott Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
pam_beesly What did Jan want?
michael_scott Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
pam_beesly What can't you tell me?
michael_scott Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
pam_beesly What?!
michael_scott What?
pam_beesly You just said that we're gonna be gone...?
michael_scott Do I have any messages?
pam_beesly Michael, what's going on?
michael_scott Ok, ok...
michael_scott Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
toby_flenderson Michael, uh... we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
michael_scott You knew about this all along, didn't you?
toby_flenderson Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
michael_scott Traitor. You are a traitor.
angela_martin What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
michael_scott I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
ryan_howard It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
angela_martin I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
kelly_kapoor If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
andy_bernard Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
jim_halpert I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.
stanley_hudson I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. I really couldn't be happier.
pam_beesly It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam." So, maybe that'll stop now.
roy_anderson What does that mean?
kevin_malone Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
roy_anderson I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, "You Don't Know What You Got "? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.
darryl_philbin Hey Mike.
michael_scott Darryl. Noble Darryl.
darryl_philbin Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
michael_scott I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
darryl_philbin I wasn't.
michael_scott So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
darryl_philbin Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
michael_scott Awesome.
michael_scott This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
michael_scott All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. Let's go.
dwight_schrute Yes!
pam_beesly Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.
michael_scott Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
dwight_schrute What's the plan?
michael_scott Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
dwight_schrute Can I drive?
michael_scott No... way.
dwight_schrute Shotgun!
michael_scott No. There's no one else.
dwight_schrute Still.
dwight_schrute Thank you very much. Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
michael_scott Okay, okay. Um...
dwight_schrute But, do not worry. I have his home address right here.
michael_scott Why?
dwight_schrute Christmas card list.
michael_scott You sent him cards? You never met him.
dwight_schrute But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
jim_halpert Hey, do you have a second?
josh_porter Sure, what's up?
jim_halpert I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
josh_porter I honestly don't. I don't know.
jim_halpert Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
josh_porter You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.
jim_halpert What does that mean?
jan_levinson Hi.
josh_porter Jan, hey.
jan_levinson Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
ryan_howard I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
ryan_howard This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
michael_scott Okay, this is it. This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person." It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.
jan_levinson So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
josh_porter Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.
jan_levinson Awesome.
josh_porter Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
jan_levinson Wha... excuse... why not?
josh_porter As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
jan_levinson Today?
josh_porter
jan_levinson You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
josh_porter
jan_levinson Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I...
josh_porter I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.
jan_levinson I'm gonna make some calls.
jim_halpert Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
dwight_schrute So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
michael_scott I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
dwight_schrute No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
michael_scott All right.
dwight_schrute Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
michael_scott Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
dwight_schrute Yes? What is the meaning of this?
michael_scott Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
dwight_schrute Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
michael_scott Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
dwight_schrute Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
michael_scott Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
dwight_schrute Whoa hey, why not?
michael_scott Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
dwight_schrute Okay.
michael_scott Don't touch me this time.
dwight_schrute Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
michael_scott Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
dwight_schrute Uh!
jan_levinson So... we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
jim_halpert Wow.
jan_levinson And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
jim_halpert Thank you.
jan_levinson Yeah.
jim_halpert No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
jan_levinson Michael.
jim_halpert No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
jan_levinson Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
jim_halpert Okay.
phyllis_vance Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
kevin_malone Where are we going?
phyllis_vance I thought maybe DJ's.
kevin_malone How about Cugino's?
angela_martin I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
kevin_malone How 'bout Cooper's then?
angela_martin No seafood.
kevin_malone But, I don't want to go to DJ's.
angela_martin Oh, now all of a sudden you get picky?
phyllis_vance Okay, forget it.
kevin_malone Hooters?
angela_martin No.
dwight_schrute Ah. Here, replinish your fluids.
michael_scott
jan_levinson Where's Michael?
pam_beesly He's not here. I don't know where he is.
jan_levinson Wha... what's going on here?
phyllis_vance We know the branch is closing; Michael told us.
jan_levinson Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
angela_martin Yes!
kevin_malone Yes!
phyllis_vance Stanley!
pam_beesly Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
jan_levinson Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is... and tell him.
pam_beesly Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
jan_levinson Back?
pam_beesly Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
jan_levinson Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.
dwight_schrute who is it?
michael_scott The office.
dwight_schrute Gonna get it?
michael_scott No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
pam_beesly I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
ryan_howard Is Jim coming back.
pam_beesly That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.
ryan_howard I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
pam_beesly Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?
ryan_howard Oh, yeah, totally.
kelly_kapoor Ahhhhh! I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! This is the best day of my whole l ife!
karen_filippelli What you gonna do?
jim_halpert I really don't know. How you doing with all this?
karen_filippelli You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
jim_halpert You'd actually move to Scranton?
karen_filippelli Yeah, if they let me, I think I... I think I would.
jim_halpert New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
karen_filippelli Yeah, you know... I might do that. I, who knows? I... I might do that.
josh_porter Hey Andy!
andy_bernard What's up, Josh?
josh_porter I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
andy_bernard Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.
michael_scott Anything?
dwight_schrute Nothing.
michael_scott What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
dwight_schrute Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
michael_scott All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
dwight_schrute My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
michael_scott That was hilarious. The foam ...
dwight_schrute Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
michael_scott Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
dwight_schrute What were your favorite moments?
michael_scott Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
dwight_schrute What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
michael_scott God, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Well, it doesn't...
kevin_malone Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
pam_beesly No thanks, guys.
kevin_malone All right.
pam_beesly Have fun though.
kevin_malone Cool.
phyllis_vance Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.
pam_beesly Really? Where did you hear that?
phyllis_vance I was...
kevin_malone Hey Ryan, you coming?
ryan_howard Uh yeah, we'll meet you there.
kevin_malone Awesome. Let's go, Phyllis.
phyllis_vance I'll tell you later.
pam_beesly Okay.
roy_anderson Crazy day, huh?
pam_beesly Yeah.
roy_anderson Yeah, man! I'm uh... I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
pam_beesly Yeah, me too.
pam_beesly Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
jim_halpert Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
karen_filippelli Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
jim_halpert Okay.
karen_filippelli Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So...there you go.
michael_scott What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
dwight_schrute
michael_scott Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
dwight_schrute Oh my God!
michael_scott What?!
dwight_schrute Stranford is closed! Michael, we're not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.
michael_scott We did it? We did it.
dwight_schrute We did it!
michael_scott and Dwight We did it! We did it!
michael_scott Right here! Right here!
michael_scott and Dwight Ouu! Ou! Ouu! Ouu!
michael_scott Yeah, baby!
dwight_schrute In your face!
michael_scott We did it!
dwight_schrute Oh, man.
michael_scott How did we do it?
dwight_schrute I don't ... have no idea.
michael_scott I don't understand.
toby_flenderson Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
