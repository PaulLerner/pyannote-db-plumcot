david_wallace Wallace ...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
andy_bernard I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
david_wallace Really? "Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA."
andy_bernard And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
david_wallace "By the way, Oscar says 'hi'"
andy_bernard Oscar says "hi" all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. "Hi" "Hello" "Hola" You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say "hi"?
david_wallace Andy.
andy_bernard But you're calling me a liar.
david_wallace Andy!
andy_bernard By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
david_wallace Watch it Andy!
andy_bernard Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. "Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick." Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
david_wallace My wife?
andy_bernard This has been a really tough time.
david_wallace Yeah?
andy_bernard Yeah.
david_wallace Has it?
andy_bernard Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
david_wallace Shh.
andy_bernard It was like a security blan-
david_wallace Andy.
andy_bernard -ket
david_wallace Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
andy_bernard You're not?
david_wallace No.
andy_bernard That's awesome.
david_wallace I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
andy_bernard David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
david_wallace We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
andy_bernard Crystal.
david_wallace You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
andy_bernard Vanilla. Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
andy_bernard Good morning.
erin_hannon Good morning.
andy_bernard And how are you on this fine-
andy_bernard Ok, we ready? Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
andy_bernard Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
pam_beesly He sounds like a wounded animal.
stanley_hudson Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
phyllis_vance I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
stanley_hudson I'm the same way with horny people.
pam_beesly Ok.
erin_hannon Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
pam_beesly Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
pam_beesly Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
dwight_schrute No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
dwight_schrute I need you.
angela_martin Ahh! Dwight!
dwight_schrute And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
angela_martin What? What is it?
dwight_schrute It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
angela_martin Dwight, that's awful.
dwight_schrute You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by Aunt Shirley.
angela_martin What do you mean by "poisoned"?
dwight_schrute Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
angela_martin Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
angela_martin But I don't see how this is my problem.
dwight_schrute Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
angela_martin Ugh.
dwight_schrute And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
angela_martin Gah.
dwight_schrute There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
angela_martin It's fine.
dwight_schrute It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
angela_martin Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
dwight_schrute It's a divet...
angela_martin I'll help you!
dwight_schrute ..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
angela_martin Ugh.
andy_bernard Where are you going?
pam_beesly Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
andy_bernard Wha? Oh, burn. Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
dwight_schrute How dare you?
andy_bernard I'm still the boss!
erin_hannon I...
andy_bernard The answer is yes.
erin_hannon ..just have some messages for you.
andy_bernard Are they from you?
erin_hannon Well no, they're from clients.
andy_bernard Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
erin_hannon I can't. I-
andy_bernard Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
erin_hannon These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
andy_bernard I don't want to talk about work right now.
erin_hannon Well I only want to talk about work right now.
andy_bernard Then I want my big blue sweater back.
erin_hannon Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
pete_miller I've got the seat adjusted right.
clark Perfect height, yeah.
andy_bernard She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
pete_miller I was just leaving.
andy_bernard Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
pete_miller I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
andy_bernard Survey says ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
clark Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
andy_bernard Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
clark There you go, good for you.
andy_bernard No.
clark You just let it all hang out, that's what...
andy_bernard May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you.
clark I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
dwight_schrute Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
aunt_shirley Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight.
angela_martin Hello Aunt Shirley.
aunt_shirley Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch.
dwight_schrute This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
aunt_shirley New clothes? What for?
dwight_schrute OK
angela_martin Oh, God.
dwight_schrute You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
angela_martin Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
aunt_shirley How would you like a mean cold slap?
angela_martin Ow!
dwight_schrute Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
aunt_shirley I could do that.
dwight_schrute Ok.
angela_martin No. No.
dwight_schrute Yeah, trust me.
angela_martin No.
dwight_schrute It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
aunt_shirley Step on it!
andy_bernard Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
phyllis_vance Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
andy_bernard I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
oscar_martinez You're clearly snooping.
creed_bratton That's kinda uncool, man.
meredith_palmer Ah, come on.
phyllis_vance Andy!
oscar_martinez That's her private property.
meredith_palmer Tell us!
andy_bernard Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?
phyllis_vance What does that even mean?
meredith_palmer What's it say?
phyllis_vance Put it down.
andy_bernard Everyone please, just-
creed_bratton It's not cool.
phyllis_vance Put it down
oscar_martinez Andy. That is her private property.
meredith_palmer Boo.
andy_bernard Oh my god.
stanley_hudson Uh huh.
phyllis_vance See?
stanley_hudson That's where nosey'll get you.
phyllis_vance Told you so.
andy_bernard Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
darryl_philbin Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
andy_bernard Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
kevin_malone Pete...
clark Hmm.
kevin_malone Pete what?
pete_miller It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
pam_beesly hello!
jim_halpert Hey! There she is. How you doin?
pam_beesly Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
jim_halpert You look great.
pam_beesly Ok
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly What's that? Is that a-
jim_halpert Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.
isaac Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door.
pam_beesly How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
isaac It's a phone?
pam_beesly Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
isaac Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You're gonna crush it, Pam.
pam_beesly Thanks.
jim_halpert You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
pam_beesly Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
jim_halpert Call you right back. What were you saying?
pam_beesly Ha ha.
athlead_employee Coworker Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line.
jim_halpert I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it. OK, good luck!
pam_beesly Bye.
angela_martin Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
dwight_schrute In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
aunt_shirley
dwight_schrute Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
angela_martin Spray her down?
dwight_schrute No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
pete_miller Hey.
andy_bernard Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
pete_miller Yeah. You were gone.
andy_bernard I knew it!
pete_miller For a long time, Andy.
andy_bernard You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
pete_miller Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
andy_bernard No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
pete_miller What?
andy_bernard Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. So you had a bad day-
pete_miller Andy?
andy_bernard ..The camera don't lie!
pete_miller Andy.
andy_bernard You're being an idiot get..
pete_miller I'm trying..
andy_bernard Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
pete_miller Andy.
andy_bernard Because you suck.
pete_miller You can't fire-
andy_bernard And you're fired...
pete_miller If you want to talk to me
andy_bernard So you had a bad day...
pete_miller I'll be in the annex.
andy_bernard Rut ti doh doh...
pete_miller Alright? I'll be in the annex.
andy_bernard Rut tit doh doh...
pete_miller Toby!
andy_bernard Rut ti doh doo doh
pete_miller Toby?
toby_flenderson You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
andy_bernard No.
toby_flenderson Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
andy_bernard Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
toby_flenderson Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
andy_bernard They already have a contract? "Mutually agree to-" Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
toby_flenderson It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
andy_bernard Well, I'm not signing away my rights.
toby_flenderson I already signed it. I was just showing you.
andy_bernard Ok, well we'll see about that.
toby_flenderson Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. It's the original.
mark ... talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting...Is that her? Hey guys! Say something.
pam_beesly Hello.
mark Hi, I'm Mark.
pam_beesly Hi, Pam, hello.
mark I'm the horrible boss around here, but please don't hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D'Jango! I don't agree with the use of the "N" word in that movie. It's, it's too soon.
pam_beesly I'm Pam Halpert.
mark Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style. He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it?
pam_beesly Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
aunt_shirley Time to get clean!
dwight_schrute It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
angela_martin You have to use chains?
dwight_schrute You'll see. Here we go.
aunt_shirley Let's get this show on the road.
dwight_schrute Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
angela_martin Dwight!
dwight_schrute Let's get to it.
angela_martin No! No!
dwight_schrute Give it a whirl.
angela_martin Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
aunt_shirley Stop your belly-aching and hose me.
dwight_schrute I need you to hose my aunt.
angela_martin No Dwight!
dwight_schrute OK you are useless.
angela_martin No, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Give me the hose!
angela_martin No Dwight, I won't-
dwight_schrute Ahh! OK!
angela_martin I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
dwight_schrute Yes ma'am.
angela_martin Good.
mark This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok?
toby_flenderson Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
nellie_bertram Um.
toby_flenderson Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
nellie_bertram Oh no.
toby_flenderson ...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
nellie_bertram No no no no.
toby_flenderson ...minor points.
nellie_bertram No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
toby_flenderson I've been drafting a letter.
nellie_bertram For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
mark My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say "Chillax" people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me.
roger No. I heard you.
mark Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.
pam_beesly Oh my god.
andy_bernard Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
meredith_palmer Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
andy_bernard Ugh.
meredith_palmer Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
phyllis_vance Come on Andy, they're a good match.
andy_bernard That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
darryl_philbin Hey, Andy.
andy_bernard What?!
darryl_philbin You've got a booger bubble going on there.
andy_bernard Sorry.
darryl_philbin It's ok.
andy_bernard My whole life is a booger bubble!
mark This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom. From The Smurfs movie.
pam_beesly Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
mark What does this say here? To ti te per tat... what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it.
pam_beesly Oh, cause it was upside down.
mark You're a good audience.
pam_beesly So um-
mark Unlike some of these people around here.
pam_beesly Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
mark Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don't jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean...you think they like me, Pam?
pam_beesly Yes.
mark What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I'm gonna do Dylan! Pam Halpert is my name, and I've been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the Pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute...You have children?
pam_beesly Two children, yes.
mark You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be.
pete_miller Hey. You got a sec to talk?
andy_bernard Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation pen1s. Translation? My manhood.
pete_miller Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
andy_bernard Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
erin_hannon Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
andy_bernard Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
pete_miller Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
erin_hannon See? We can all be friends!
pete_miller Yeah.
erin_hannon Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
pete_miller I do think we can have a fair....
andy_bernard Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
mark Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So...
pam_beesly I am not pr-
mark You're not.
pam_beesly Pregnant, no.
mark I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.
pam_beesly Wow.
mark Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-
pam_beesly I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
mark It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.
pam_beesly So, kinda like a receptionist.
mark Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?
pam_beesly Yes.
mark Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted.
pam_beesly I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
aunt_shirley Ow! The braid is too tight.
angela_martin Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
aunt_shirley Yes ma'am.
angela_martin I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
aunt_shirley Ok.
angela_martin There.
aunt_shirley Thank you Angela.
toby_flenderson I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
nellie_bertram Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
darryl_philbin Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
toby_flenderson Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it.
nellie_bertram He's doing it.
pam_beesly hey!
jim_halpert Hey, how'd the interview go?
pam_beesly Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
jim_halpert I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
pam_beesly Eight? Really?
jim_halpert I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
pam_beesly Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
jim_halpert Alright, love you.
pam_beesly Love you.
alice Hi.
erin_hannon Hi.
alice I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.
erin_hannon Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
alice Ok, great. Thanks.
meredith_palmer Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
erin_hannon Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
alice Nice to meet you. Cute sweater.
erin_hannon Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
kevin_malone I'm Kevin.
alice Pete?
pete_miller Alice. Oh man.
alice It's uh, been a while, huh?
erin_hannon What, do you two know each other?
pete_miller Yeah. We uh, have a history.
erin_hannon Oh.
alice History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years.
erin_hannon That's so random.
pete_miller Well. Is it?
erin_hannon Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.
creed_bratton Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
gabe_lewis Hello beautiful.
kevin_malone Didn't you two used to do it?
gabe_lewis We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
creed_bratton She's looking good.
toby_flenderson Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
toby_flenderson This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? I think this is a start of my first friendship.
clark So Pete was a librarian?
alice He worked as a librarian freshman year.
clark Was he like the sexy librarian?
pete_miller Ok.
alice Is there like somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her.
andy_bernard Hi.
alice Hi.
andy_bernard Hi, how's it going?
alice Hi. Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p-
andy_bernard Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
pete_miller Andy, that is really inappropriate.
andy_bernard Awkward.
pete_miller It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
andy_bernard Really uncomfortable situation.
pete_miller Yeah.
andy_bernard It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta "move on". Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm.
alice So there's no marketing department.
clark No.
pete_miller No.
gabe_lewis You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
erin_hannon So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
gabe_lewis Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
erin_hannon Yeah.
gabe_lewis You must be pretty horny.
nellie_bertram well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? One week? Ok, two weeks? Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
aunt_shirley I feel like a show pony.
dwight_schrute And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
angela_martin You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
dwight_schrute By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
angela_martin Mmhm.
dwight_schrute Would you like the stink sack?
angela_martin Is it any good?
dwight_schrute No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
angela_martin Thank you.
aunt_shirley So, when's the wedding?
angela_martin Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
aunt_shirley That's what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.
pam_beesly Hello?
jim_halpert Hey! Back here.
pam_beesly Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
jim_halpert Si, senor.
pam_beesly Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
jim_halpert Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
pam_beesly Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
jim_halpert Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
pam_beesly You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
jim_halpert Alright. So, tell me all about it.
dwight_schrute Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
angela_martin It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. Dwight, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
angela_martin No, Dwight. The Senator.
dwight_schrute Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
angela_martin I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
dwight_schrute I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
angela_martin I made a vow. I gave my word.
dwight_schrute Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
angela_martin Good night, D.
erin_hannon How are you doing? Is it really rough?
pete_miller It is so unpleasant. You?
andy_bernard Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
andy_bernard Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
gabe_lewis Honestly, it was a little weird.
andy_bernard Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
gabe_lewis I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
erin_hannon Gabe!
gabe_lewis ...a lot of the time.
andy_bernard And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
pete_miller Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
alice Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem.
pete_miller It was college. That is what you do.
alice Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that.
erin_hannon Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
andy_bernard We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
gabe_lewis Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
erin_hannon Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
gabe_lewis I got a tattoo for you.
erin_hannon I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
gabe_lewis Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
alice So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete.
pete_miller She's nice to me.
alice How's that P.E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher.
erin_hannon Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
gabe_lewis I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
pete_miller Oh my god.
gabe_lewis What kind of music are you into, Peter?
pete_miller Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
gabe_lewis Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
pete_miller No!
gabe_lewis Erin, are you even hearing this?
erin_hannon He didn't even say that.
alice He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can't even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else?
gabe_lewis Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
erin_hannon Gabe, I don't-
gabe_lewis Give me one night with you...
erin_hannon What is that supposed to mean?
gabe_lewis I have shaved everything...
erin_hannon I don't want you to shave everything.
alice I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?!
pete_miller I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man.
gabe_lewis I am as smooth as a porpoise.
pete_miller Why don't you say in the beginning "This isn't really going that well"
gabe_lewis Shove his sashimi!
erin_hannon What do you-!
alice Because I had to wait-
andy_bernard Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? Yeah. Yeah, it does.
pam_beesly So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
jim_halpert Tell me about the cologne. How much?
pam_beesly Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.
jim_halpert You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
pam_beesly Guess what poster he had on his wall?
jim_halpert Austin Powers.
pam_beesly MmMm.
jim_halpert Ferris Bueller.
pam_beesly MmMm. You're getting colder.
jim_halpert Not Night at the Roxbury.
pam_beesly No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
jim_halpert I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
pam_beesly I don't know, but it's interesting right?
jim_halpert It's fascinating.
pam_beesly He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
jim_halpert That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
pam_beesly Mmhm.
jim_halpert So, next interview has to be better.
pam_beesly I don't know.
jim_halpert What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
pam_beesly I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
jim_halpert Huh. This is a little out of left field.
pam_beesly Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
jim_halpert And I have started a business in Philadelphia.
