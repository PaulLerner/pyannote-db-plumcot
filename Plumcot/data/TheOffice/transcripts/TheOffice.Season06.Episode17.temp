Pam  I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.
Dwight Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Jim  Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely.
Dwight No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!
Pam There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.
Dwight  Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.
Dwight I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
Pam Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
Kevin I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Pam Hmm.
Kevin Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
Kevin I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.
Pam Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?
Kevin I think it should be a surprise.
Meredith  Oh, getting there, huh?
Pam No, no. I still have time.
Pam I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
Jim Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Pam If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Jim Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
Pam I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Pam Ooh.
Michael Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...
Jim Michael.
Michael Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Jim Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
Michael Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Pam You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
Michael Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Jim Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.
Michael Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!
Pam Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.
Erin Ooh, spooky. But why?
Jim Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Pam Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.
Nick Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.
Michael Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
Angela  What are you looking at?
Dwight Ha, nerd.
Kelly Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
Dwight  Bare my child.
Angela Excuse me?
Dwight I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4 00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
Jim  That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.
Pam Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.
Jim Are you serious? Pam.
Pam No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
Jim I... Pam, please.
Pam I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Andy Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate.
Pam Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.
Jim Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Pam Five minutes apart.
Jim So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Pam Okay, stop watching me.
Jim Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Pam Mm-hmm.
Jim Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Pam Not until midnight.
Andy Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
Erin I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Andy My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
Jim You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Michael No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
Jim  Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
Pam Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
Michael Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!
Michael Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Michael The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
Andy Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
Michael I will allow that.
Andy Yes! Can anyone do those?
Stanley I'm going to go look at the Internet.
Jim  Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one.
Pam Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.
Michael Okay.
Kelly Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Pam Oh, thanks, Kelly.
Michael Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
Pam Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Michael Yes, Phyl?
Phyllis I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Michael  Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
Andy I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
Michael  That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.
Andy Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance.
Ryan  "You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home."
Erin  Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.
Angela Good afternoon.
Dwight Have a seat.
Angela What is this?
Dwight Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Angela Of course.
Dwight It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Angela You know I was thinking...
Dwight Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one  Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?
Angela Agreed.
Michael  Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
Kevin For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Jim Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know...
Pam Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.
Michael Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.
Jim Alright.
Michael Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.
Erin Um, stimulate the nipples.
Michael Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
Kevin Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Meredith I have a shirt like that in my car.
Michael Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
Erin Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Michael Okay, the opposite of that?
Kevin Stick spicy food up her butt.
Jim Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Pam Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
Jim Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.
Pam Why don't you go do some work?
Jim Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled.
Pam I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
Jim No, I don't.
Pam Okay.
Jim Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally.
Michael Ooh, someone's freakin'.
Andy A little frazzled.
Michael I think he is.
Jim I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes.
Dwight Acceptable names include and are limited to Ebenezer.
Angela Jedediah.
Dwight Jonas.
Angela Jedediah.
Dwight Warf.
Angela No Star Trek names.
Dwight Okay. Fine.
Angela What if it's a girl?
Dwight Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.
Angela Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.
Dwight Yes you can.
Angela No.
Dwight It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after s*x, and then extremely cold for five months.
Angela Absolutely not.
Jim  Hey.
Pam Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
Jim Ah, you know me too well.
Pam Okay, Jim.
Jim Yeah? ... Oh.
Pam Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?
Jim Did you say "she?"
Pam I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad.
Jim Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.
Pam Mm-hmm.
Jim Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man.
Pam I know.
Jim Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.
Pam Good.
Jim Yeah.
Pam Okay.
Jim Alright... Hey, did you change?
Pam Oh, yeah, my water broke.
Jim Oh. Oh...
Pam  Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.
Michael Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?
Phyllis No, it's 4 35.
Michael 4 35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have s*x like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
Pam No, not yet, Michael.
Michael We can do...
Pam Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?
Michael Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
Oscar That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Michael What is October feast?
Pam There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
Kevin Our ultra feast menu's theme Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay?
Pam Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Michael Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
Jim Alright. Time to go. Okay.
Michael That's right, let's do this.
Jim Let's give it a shot.
Pam Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.
Jim Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital.
Pam They're not that bad still, babe.
Jim Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital.
Pam No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.
Jim Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Michael Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.
Pam No, it's passing, it's fine.
Jim Pam.
Pam Ah, no, it passed. It's good.
Jim You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.
Pam Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
Jim Hey, are you kidding me?
Michael Are you kidding?
Jim If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Michael You can do this. You can do this.
Jim Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared.
Michael I'm scared, too.
Kevin I'm petrified.
Jim The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
Michael Yeah.
Jim A really awesome baby.
Michael We're going to have a baby.
Jim So let's have it at the hospital.
Michael Let's do that.
Jim How are we doing on contractions?
Michael Two minutes apart.
Jim Two minutes...
Pam Oh, God. Oh, no.
Jim Michael, I told you.
Michael It's okay.
Jim No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Pam Jim, we waited too long!
Michael I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.
Jim We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Michael We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?
Pam I don't want to have my baby here.
Michael You're not going to. You know where you're going?
Pam The hospital.
Michael Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?
Pam A baby.
Michael Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
Michael I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!
Dwight No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Jim Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
Michael No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.
Jim Alright, I have my wallet.
Michael Yes.
Jim Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Michael Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?
Erin There's nothing in it.
Michael You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
Oscar The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Dwight Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!
Pam Dwight, get away!
Michael No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
Erin I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Dwight  "We" don't.
Jim Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here.
Dwight, Jim and Michael Here we go!
Phyllis Good luck!
Nick Good luck, Pam!
Michael Thank you! Wish me luck!
Creed Have fun!
Meredith Hey, it's 5 00!
Michael  Here we go! Here we go! On our way!
Stanley Hold it!
Michael Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!
Toby Oh, one more!
Michael No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot.
Michael Dwight, what is the traffic like?
Dwight Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!
Michael Alright.
Dwight Let's go!
Michael Geesh, Dwight!
Dwight  Michael!
Michael What!?
Dwight This is where I saw that deer last week.
Michael Where?
Dwight Right over by that fence.
Michael By the bushes?
Jim Okay, Michael! Focus!
Michael Okay, go, go, go, go!
Dwight Let's go!
Dwight I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.
Jim Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.
Michael Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.
Pam Michael!
Michael Yeah?
Pam Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.
Jim Michael, come on!
Michael I'm texting about you, okay!?
Dwight Ugh, alright. Let's move! ... What?
Policeman Pull over!
Dwight Are you kidding me?
Policeman Pull over! You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight!
Pam Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!
Jim Okay.
Pam It has the birth song on it!
Jim Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine.
Pam Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
Jim Okay, so what do you want to do?
Pam I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Jim Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now.
Michael Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. Ready?
Dwight Dwight Schrute.
Michael Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.
Dwight Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Michael Okay.
Pam Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...
Dwight I don't need a key.
Pam Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
Dwight No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
Pam Dwight just listen! It's underneath...
Michael Okay.
Jim Wait, you alright?
Pam Yes.
Michael Do you have everything, guys?
Jim Michael, just go park the car.
Michael Okay, alright.
Hospital employee Sir! You can't park here!
Michael Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. I just did.
