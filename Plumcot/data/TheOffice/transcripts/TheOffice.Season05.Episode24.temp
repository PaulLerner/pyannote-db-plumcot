michael Hup!
pam Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
michael Hup!
pam We're getting pretty good at it.
jim andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with dwight for. several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
pam The timeline's messy.
jim Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
andy This is my solo.
pam I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
andy Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
jim I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
andy Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch. $9, 000.
pam I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
andy Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
pam Mm-hmm.
phyllis What's wrong with you?
dwight These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
phyllis I think you look nice.
dwight Doesn't charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
charles Looking good.
dwight 'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! Okay.
dwight When michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
michael Hey.
dwight Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
michael Is this good?
dwight They have some great kitchen ideas.
michael Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
dwight It's small, I know.
michael I really appreciate it.
dwight Thanks, Michael. Wait, what is this?
michael It's for your trouble.
dwight Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.
michael No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
dwight Michael, you know I can't take this.
michael Yes, I do.
dwight But don't forget you owe me $10.
michael That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
dwight Michael.
andy What was up with pam being all pushy and negative in there?
jim I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
andy It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
jim Am I going down a road?
andy When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
jim It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
andy I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
jim I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
michael Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
pam I'm not gonna do that.
michael That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
ryan I can get there.
michael Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
ryan Oh, awesome.
michael Bring it in. Morning cheer. Michael, pam &amp;
ryan U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go michael Scott Paper Company!
pam I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
dwight You needed to speak to me?
charles Dwight, take a seat.
dwight I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
charles Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
dwight Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
charles I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
dwight Your concern is noted.
charles Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so. focused.
dwight Like a wolf. Thank you.
charles And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
dwight Really?
charles Definitely.
dwight It's firm.
michael I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
dwight I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
michael Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
dwight No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
michael I'm not following you.
dwight Imagine. Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
michael Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
dwight Good, do you see what I'm saying?
michael Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
dwight No.
michael Can I use it?
dwight No.
michael Dwight, are you talking about us?
dwight It is possible that I could be talking about us.
michael Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
dwight It is the situation that we are in now.
michael So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
dwight I'm not a barbarian.
michael Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
dwight I will.
michael Dwight?
dwight Yes?
michael Is the cool new guy Charles?
dwight I've said too much.
michael Is it Stanley?
jim Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
andy 'Noishe. '
jim -I just don't know if I can do it.
andy That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
jim It's just that pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
andy And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. Ah, what'd you do that for?
jim You know that I was doin' this.
andy Totally.
jim Okay.
michael Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
dwight I'm sorry, michael
charles Hi, Michael.
michael Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
charles No, Mich-Michael.
michael Dwight, run!
charles Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
michael You be cool.
charles Yes.
michael Just-what's going on?
charles We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
michael Mm-do. dwight would not-
charles He did.
dwight I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
charles Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
michael I. Understand. Nothing.
michael Wow.
pam Michael, are you alright?
michael It was a setup. dwight told Charles. He told him.
pam Tell us what you're talking about.
ryan Yeah.
michael It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
pam We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
michael I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
andy Hey, Jim.
jim I just totally blew a sales call.
andy Bro, I do that all the time.
jim Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
andy Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
jim Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
andy Well, so what? Your body's a ten.
jim Forget it.
andy Jim.
jim I said forget it. . push;
dwight dwight Schrute.
michael Hello, traitor.
dwight I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
michael I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
pam Michael!
michael I'm just getting hardcore with him.
ryan Finally.
michael Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. Bill Cosby.
dwight Mr. Schofield, please?
secretary He's in a meeting.
dwight Dammit!
michael Is Mr. schofield there? Automated phone
voice If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first.
stanley So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
dwight I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
phyllis You sound worried.
dwight And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations!
michael Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. schofield that michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me. Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
ryan Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
pam I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
michael Wow. High score?
dwight And no, I cannot lower my current prices. Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
dwight michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander, ' but still.
michael Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
dwight I would like to arrange a truce.
michael So you heard schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
dwight Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
michael No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
dwight Michael.
michael Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
dwight In which direction?
michael Toward the sun.
dwight At what time?
michael Noon.
dwight That-
michael You have two seconds.
dwight Michael. Sorry.
michael Dwight.
dwight Michael.
michael I hope you're not recording this conversation. Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
dwight You were making me do things that were not all right.
michael So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
dwight And not come through for you?
michael If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
dwight I want a truce.
michael I do too.
dwight Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
michael Cooper's.
dwight I had fish yesterday.
michael Damn it.
michael Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
dwight Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
michael Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
dwight I hit a bear.
michael What?
dwight He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
michael Yeah, sure.
dwight Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?
michael Okay, see you in a bit. dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
pam Sounds neat.
ryan We can spend a couple days there.
pam Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
michael Yeah.
dwight Did you enjoy your lunch?
michael Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
dwight No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
michael No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. You?
dwight Me.
michael What about our truce?
dwight I broke it.
michael On purpose?
dwight Yes.
michael Why?
dwight You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
michael Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
dwight And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
michael Oh. b*st*rd!
dwight Hi there. dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
dwight Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend. " "Tall" and "beets. "
dwight And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here.
michael Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
dwight Sure. That'd be fine.
michael If you keep coming after us, the michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
dwight This is war and that is what happens.
michael Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
dwight Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
michael Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
dwight Michael! Michael!
michael You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
secretary Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
michael Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
dwight Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
michael Walking in the door. Mr.
schofield Michael, good to see you.
michael Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door.
michael Now, when dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn. Mr.
schofield Really?
michael Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
dwight Are you saying you invented paper?
andy Okay, okay.
jim Oh, God.
andy Okay, Tuna.
kelly Hey, guys.
jim Hey.
andy Hello.
andy Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
kevin I guess I could be nicer.
phyllis Andy, I think jim is messing with you.
andy Oh, really?
phyllis Mm-hmm.
jim Okay.
andy Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
jim Two things I need you to understand. One, pam and I are very happy together.
andy Uh, that's not what was-
jim And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
andy Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
michael What is that thing that dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
dwight It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!
secretary Uh, hello, Dwight.
dwight Spin move.
secretary Oh-
dwight Ha ha! April 13th, 2002. Mr.
schofield Dwight, I'm in a meeting.
michael That's very rude.
dwight I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased. Mr.
schofield Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
dwight La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
michael I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin.
dwight Come on.
michael Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
dwight What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you. Mr.
schofield Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
michael That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual. Mr.
schofield Uh, ok, sure.
michael Good, good, good. I will see you.
dwight Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son? Mr.
schofield Excuse me?
michael I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?" Most colors mean "Don't say it. "
dwight How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
michael I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
