andy_bernard What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
jim_halpert I don't know. Oh! That's... not... yours.
jim_halpert Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
stanley_hudson What's a seven letter word for purse?
kevin_malone Satchel!
stanley_hudson Nope. Starts with an H.
andy_bernard Handbag.
stanley_hudson Hmmm. Thank you.
andy_bernard Shh! Shhh!
michael_scott All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
all@ Yay!
stanley_hudson Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all tomorrow
pam_beesly Bye, Stanley! Love you!
dwight_schrute So long, Stanley!
stanley_hudson Night, everybody.
oscar_martinez So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
kevin_malone The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like Michael Moore.
erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
michael_scott A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! Six seconds, MacGruber! Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! Uh, two seconds MacGruber! Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! MACGRUBERRRR!
pam_beesly People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
jim_halpert Stop.
dwight_schrute Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
jim_halpert Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
dwight_schrute To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler. Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
pam_beesly What?
dwight_schrute You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
pam_beesly I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
jim_halpert I am Popeye!
jim_halpert I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number ...no.
gabe_lewis In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face... we will be reviewing our sales policies. I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
michael_scott MACGRUBER!
todd_packer Packer Lame. Why don't witches wear panties?
michael_scott Oh, here we go!
todd_packer Packer Because they need to grip the broom!
michael_scott OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
dwight_schrute Lake Erie.
gabe_lewis When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
michael_scott So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
gabe_lewis That is correct.
todd_packer Packer Has anyone started calling you "Gabe-wad" yet?
gabe_lewis Not here.
danny_cordray Gabe-wad.
gabe_lewis Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-
michael_scott Blackula!
darryl_philbin Dracula.
michael_scott Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
darryl_philbin Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
michael_scott Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
darryl_philbin I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
michael_scott Really? We're good?
darryl_philbin Yeah. We're cool.
michael_scott Okay. Okay.
darryl_philbin What's under your shirt?
michael_scott Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
michael_scott Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.
toby_flenderson It's a great stick, right?
ryan_howard It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
toby_flenderson Thanks!
oscar_martinez Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
toby_flenderson No.
ryan_howard No.
kelly_kapoor I get that. I get that.
danny_cordray Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.
kevin_malone You own a bar?
danny_cordray Public School, at exit 11.
oscar_martinez That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
danny_cordray So. You're all on the list!
ryan_howard Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
creed_bratton Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
danny_cordray Okay.
kevin_malone I don't think that she would leave Jim for Danny.
phyllis_vance I don't know, they're both handsome.
dwight_schrute Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
phyllis_vance I think he-
creed_bratton Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that Danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
jim_halpert So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
pam_beesly We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
jim_halpert That's right.
pam_beesly Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
jim_halpert Yikes.
pam_beesly But I've learned to love again. He's a cartoon sailor.
jim_halpert Oh, no.
pam_beesly And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
jim_halpert No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
andy_bernard Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
jim_halpert I don't care.
kevin_malone I am never gonna forget what Danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
andy_bernard You know what else? The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties.
kevin_malone Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl... Creed's a maybe.
andy_bernard Creed's going?!
jim_halpert Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
michael_scott Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
darryl_philbin Hello?
michael_scott Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
darryl_philbin I'm good.
michael_scott You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
darryl_philbin This is embarrassing, Michael.
michael_scott Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
darryl_philbin Let me put my shoes on.
pam_beesly Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.
michael_scott This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
angela_martin So, what happened?
michael_scott I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
erin_hannon Oh!
michael_scott And we are going to straighten this out.
andy_bernard Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
michael_scott Mmhm!
gabe_lewis Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? Darryl told me, and then I told them, giving Darryl full credit, so... no need to screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give Darryl a round of applause, as planned.
michael_scott I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
dwight_schrute He went to Gabe behind your back.
michael_scott No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
dwight_schrute He went over your head to go behind your back.
michael_scott What is taking someone from behind?
dwight_schrute No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
michael_scott It was a good idea, though.
dwight_schrute Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
andy_bernard Hey, Danny.
danny_cordray Hey.
andy_bernard I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
danny_cordray I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
andy_bernard You were?
kevin_malone Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like... next Halloween.
danny_cordray For sure.
andy_bernard We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
danny_cordray What are you talking about?
andy_bernard Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...
danny_cordray Jim and Pam really don't want you to go?
kevin_malone They're really upset about the whole Danny situation.
danny_cordray I'll talk to them.
kevin_malone Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
danny_cordray Okay.
kevin_malone Or you're dead.
danny_cordray Okay.
kevin_malone Okay.
erin_hannon Kelly! Great costume!
toby_flenderson Oh.
angela_martin KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
kelly_kapoor Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
oscar_martinez Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth... forty bucks.
kelly_kapoor Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
angela_martin Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
angela_martin This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
dwight_schrute Garbage magnet. Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
michael_scott What the hell are they talking about?
dwight_schrute Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
michael_scott Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
kevin_malone I am so sorry.
michael_scott Oh, you're sorry?
kevin_malone I just thought-
michael_scott What did you just thought?
kevin_malone Well, Gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-
michael_scott All right.
kevin_malone I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
michael_scott Okay.
kevin_malone Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
michael_scott Well, don't let it happen again.
kevin_malone You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
michael_scott I-
kevin_malone you, Gabe!
gabe_lewis Okay...
danny_cordray Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
jim_halpert That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
danny_cordray Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
pam_beesly Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
danny_cordray Exactly.
jim_halpert It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
danny_cordray No! Two or three dates.
pam_beesly It was two.
danny_cordray Was it two? I thought it was three.
pam_beesly No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...
jim_halpert Oooh! You can't handle the truth!
danny_cordray Well, that does not sound like me.
pam_beesly Yeah? It was though, that's what happened.
danny_cordray Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
pam_beesly Hmm-mm.
michael_scott Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
darryl_philbin I'm not mad. Are you mad?
michael_scott You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
darryl_philbin Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
michael_scott Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody.
darryl_philbin Mike.
michael_scott In front of me.
darryl_philbin You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
michael_scott So that's it.
darryl_philbin That's it.
michael_scott Is it?
darryl_philbin Yes.
andy_bernard Sookehhh. Bill Compton, from True Blood.
stanley_hudson How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
oscar_martinez I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
phyllis_vance Oh.
oscar_martinez Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
ryan_howard Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
pam_beesly Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
kevin_malone Pam. Can you vote for other people?
michael_scott Yeah, I gotta get in on this. Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
michael_scott Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
pam_beesly Michael, this is a bad idea.
michael_scott What's a bad idea?
pam_beesly Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
michael_scott NEVER! Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
kelly_kapoor Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
stanley_hudson Raaah!
oscar_martinez I present to you the rational consumer, as it were.
pam_beesly Angela as the nurse!
angela_martin I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
phyllis_vance What should we ask?
michael_scott Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
jim_halpert We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
erin_hannon He says no.
michael_scott Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
darryl_philbin No.
michael_scott Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
dwight_schrute Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
dwight_schrute I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
michael_scott If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?
erin_hannon A... S... S... H... E... T?
phyllis_vance An asset!
erin_hannon Ah! That's enough.
danny_cordray I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think.
todd_packer Packer I don't think you get it.
danny_cordray Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
danny_cordray This is some party, huh?
jim_halpert When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
danny_cordray Are you serious?
jim_halpert Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
danny_cordray You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and...
jim_halpert Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.
todd_packer Packer Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?
jim_halpert Nope.
danny_cordray Okay. You wanna know? I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
ryan_howard Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
meredith_palmer Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
oscar_martinez ERIN!
erin_hannon Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
pam_beesly I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
jim_halpert Just tell her the real reason.
danny_cordray Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
jim_halpert Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
pam_beesly I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like "gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why."
danny_cordray Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little... dorky.
jim_halpert Hey, man.
pam_beesly Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
gabe_lewis In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
michael_scott Thank you.
darryl_philbin You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
gabe_lewis Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
michael_scott If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
darryl_philbin You said no to this one!
michael_scott That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
darryl_philbin What have you done for me?
michael_scott Oh...
darryl_philbin What have you done for me?
michael_scott Well...
darryl_philbin Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. Gabe listened to me. All you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
gabe_lewis Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? This really make you think, Michael?
michael_scott Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
gabe_lewis Yeah.
michael_scott You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
darryl_philbin I don't understand the point of a hat.
gabe_lewis You're right, we don't need a hat.
michael_scott I am not budging on the hat issue.
gabe_lewis Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
michael_scott Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
gabe_lewis Okay, why don't we simplify this? Darryl brings it to Michael, Michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
michael_scott Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
darryl_philbin Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
michael_scott Sorry I was a jerk.
michael_scott Friends fight. Friends fight.
andy_bernard What's up, man?
darryl_philbin Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
andy_bernard When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards.
darryl_philbin This was your freshman year.
andy_bernard I started to ask myself, "Do I have big plans here?" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
darryl_philbin No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
jim_halpert To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
pam_beesly Oh, wow!
jim_halpert Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.
pam_beesly Aww, my hero!
pam_beesly Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.
kelly_kapoor If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
ryan_howard Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
creed_bratton Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
