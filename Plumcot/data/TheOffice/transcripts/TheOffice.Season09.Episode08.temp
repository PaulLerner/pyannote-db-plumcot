oscar Yesterday, angela may or may not have figured out that I'm having an affair with her husband. So I just have to wait and see. When she comes in, if she's cold and awkward and cruel to me, then great, it's business as usual.
oscar Good morning.
angela Oscar. can I ask you a question?
oscar Of course, ask me a que-- questions.
angela Is it cool in here to you?
oscar Yes, a little bit. Yes.
angela I think the thermostat is acting up again.
oscar It's the stupid thermostat! That thing is a catastrophe. So I'm gonna, um, on your suggestion, get someone to fix it. I'll just go downstairs.
angela Thank you.
oscar No, thank you, Angela.
oscar She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
dwight Well, well, well, it's finally happened. pam has ceased caring.
pam These are my painting clothes. I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.
meredith Sure you don't want to put another coat of primer on that Pam?Queen of the primer, that one.
jim You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
pam Are you avoiding your phone call?
jim What? Yeah, right. As if.
jim Today I will be asking david Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.
pam Last week jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead.
jim I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.
pam Tell them your opening line.
jim Hey David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
pam I think it's good. He likes fishing.
jim This is gonna be awful.
pete One of my jobs is to input customer complaints into the computer. And when they're in, I fill out one of these cards. But the information's already on the computer, so. . why am I filling out the card? I asked Andy, and he told me to "chillax, " and then went away on a big, long boat ride. So here we are. Don't give me a pointless office chore, because I will build a little paper house. Fight the power.
angela Meet me in the old place, five minutes. I need you.
angela Ugh!
dwight Come on in, the water's fine.
angela Dwight, it's not that kind of meeting. Put your clothes back on.
dwight I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes.
angela Just put them on! Put on your clothes. I need your help. I need someone who can operate outside of the law. Ugh.
dwight Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?
angela My marriage is in danger. I don't know who I can trust. I need someone to be there for me.
dwight All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
angela Something like that.
dwight Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
angela Can you arrange a meeting?
dwight I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.
angela Okay.
dwight Text went through.
angela Okay.
dwight All we can do is sit and wait.
angela Okay.
dwight Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem.
jim I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
david Yeah, but I really need someone in the office. If there's a crisis -- the more I think about it --
jim Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, phyllis and stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone.
david They did?
jim Yep.
david Oh, okay. Well, that is different. In that case, yes-- Maybe this can work.
jim Oh, great.
stanley Why should we help you?
jim Because we're friends.
stanley When is my birthday?
jim Unfair. When's my birthday?
stanley I don't know, because we're not friends.
jim How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?
stanley Now we're talkin'.
jim All right.
phyllis Yeah.
kevin Make it go taller.
pete That's the idea.
kevin No, not taller this way, taller this way.
pete Well, I've gotta build a wider base first before I can go higher.
kevin You're not getting this, Peter. Make it go wider. up!
pete Will do.
darryl What are y'all doing?
kevin Me and pete are building a tower.
darryl Cool. It should be taller though, right?
kevin Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
pete Kevin, I can hear you.
kevin Huh?
angela Ow! Dwight! Ow!
dwight Get in the van.
angela God!
trevor Is it safe to talk?
dwight Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good.
angela So what are your credentials?
trevor I started following people around to get exercise. Turns out, I'm damn good at it.
angela Do you have a gun?
dwight Does he own a gun? Show her.
trevor You tell me.
angela What is this?
trevor It's the receipt for my gun.
angela You don't carry it with you?
trevor Read the receipt. That's a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.
dwight Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him?
trevor Now I keep it in a safe.
dwight Mm-hmm. Good safe?
trevor Oh, you tell me.
dwight Wow!
pam I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It's just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I'm gonna limit myself to one shrub.
hide You paint wall now?
pam Yeah. Painting now. I just want to make sure that.
hide You paint now.
pam It's probably gonna be a few minutes. So you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing.
hide I wait.
meredith Sweet.
erin Yay!
darryl That's what I'm talkin' about.
pete This next card comes to us thanks to meredith Palmer, who called Eastern Pennsylvania Seminary a, quote ‘sausage factory. '
meredith Oh OOOH!
everyone 
meredith Boom!
darryl Bang.
kevin Yep, yep, yep.
pete All right. Up next we got a whole lotta Creed.
creed Let's find out what I did.
pete All right.
dwight You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
trevor And that's all off the books?
angela Obviously.
trevor Nice. No taxes.
angela Okay, so everything you need to know about the target is in here.
trevor So what's the job?
angela Murder.
trevor Okay, that's the big one. That's the big "M. "
dwight You can't have someone murdered.
angela What if they deserved it?
dwight What did they do to you, Angela?
angela They're sleeping with my husband.
dwight Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
trevor This seems a little crazy.
dwight Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
trevor But I think I'm up for it.
dwight No! No!
angela Thank you.
dwight Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
trevor That's very effective. I've been on the receiving end of that quite a few times. It's devastating.
angela No, no, no. It has to be physical. I want this person to suffer.
trevor What about a knee-capping?
dwight No! You're not helping, Trevor!
angela Yes, a knee-capping could work.
dwight No. Angela! What are you saying?
angela You said you would be there for me.
dwight I'm trying, but what you're asking is--
angela It's the only thing that will make this right.
dwight Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn.
trevor All right, then it's settled. One knee-capping. Now, the hit goes down at 4
 00. Keep in mind, once I leave, there's no turning back.
jim You know, truth be told, I think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while I'm gone.
stanley We've got all afternoon to talk about that.
waiter Morning, folks.
stanley I'll have the surf and turf with a side order of lobster.
waiter Actually, the surf and turf does come with lob--
stanley Not enough lobster. Side order.
phyllis How much wine do you have?
oscar I brought you a cookie.
angela Oh, thanks, Oscar. You're such an angel.
oscar I just gave her a cookie, and she called me an angel, so. yeah, we're good. Yeah. We dodged a bullet, yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah-- Well, I gotta go now, but-- Okay, bye. Bye.
pete There we go.
everyone 
pete Nicely done. Very nicely done. All right, this next one goes to darryl for pocket dialing a customer while having s*x.
nellie Oooohh. you salty dog.
darryl Well, yeah, what can I say, a player's gotta play.
pete There you go. . push;
darryl Actually, that was the sound of me eating spaghetti. But I'm gonna let them think the other thing.
kevin Okay, I got this one.
nellie Oh, be careful! Be careful! Be careful
kevin No, I got it. Easy does it, everyone. Nobody even take a breath.
everyone Oh no! Kevin!
nellie What did I just say? What did I just say?
pete Hey, hey, hey, it's just a mistake. Just a mistake. That's what this tower's all about -- mistakes. Okay, if you're afraid of screwing up, the tower's not for you. Show of hands --- who here has never had a complaint? That's right. Nobody. See that? Nobody. Okay? Let's get back to work, huh? Come on, you in?
kevin Yeah.
pete There we go. All right, let's do it.
jim You know, at the end of the day, it's really only two days. I mean, I'll be back in the office. If you need me for an emergency, call me. I'll be there.
phyllis You know what? I don't know where the years went. ‘Cause sometimes when I look at my hands, I don't even recognize them.
jim Tell me about it.
phyllis Whose hands are these? Theyre not my hands. I don't know.
jim All right. You know what? Maybe we'll just. We'll go slow.
phyllis No. Jim.
pete All right. Check it out.
everyone 
pete Like a Phoenix from the ashes. Ksshhhh!
kevin Nice. Pretty soon, we're gonna be at the ceiling.
erin Whoo!
pete Can you hand me a card?
erin Um. it's empty.
pete What?
nellie Oh, come on. We could use a blank card.
everyone No!!
meredith That's cheating.
pam I could get us a complaint.
meredith You? Little Miss Priss? You wouldn't fart on a butterfly.
pam No, I wouldn't. I can't even relate to that impulse. But I bet I could get us a customer complaint. I'd like to try.
nellie Hmm. Yeah. All right! Yea, go, Pam! Pam.
everyone "Pam!"
angela What? Why did you call me out here?
dwight The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
angela I don't know what you're talking about.
dwight Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
angela Fine! It's Oscar. So what?
dwight Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
angela Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
dwight I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
angela Well, you might be right. But it's too late now.
dwight What do you mean?
angela He's here.
dwight No! No, no!
dwight Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
oscar What?
dwight Come -- come with me.
oscar What are you doing?
dwight There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary.
meredith Yahtzee.
trevor Sandwich delivery for Mr. oscar Martinez.
kevin I am oscar Martinez.
angela No, not him, not him. Outside. Outside.
kevin Wha-- wh--
angela You know, there's doughnuts in the break room.
kevin Nice! Yeah.
jim Listen, I was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over.
stanley Don't be pushy Jim. It's tacky.
jim All right. Phyllis! Phyllis, that's-- that's decorative.
phyllis No, there's wine in here.
jim Still decorative.
stanley Is it white wine?
jim No.
phyllis Can you help me?
jim Don't-- don't-- don't pole people with knives.
phyllis ha ha!
jim Phyllis! Wow.
stanley Ooh, bring it over.
phyllis Got it.
dwight There's no time to explain. Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
oscar Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
dwight What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child?
oscar I don't know what you're talking about.
dwight Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about. Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us.
dwight Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us.
trevor Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this.
dwight No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder-Mifflin man. He's my tribe.
trevor I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!
oscar I got it.
dwight Disarm!
trevor You don't--
dwight Don't move. And disarm now!
trevor Okay, okay, okay, okay.
dwight No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend.
erin Okay, the client is Heymont Brake and Tire. They're family-owned, but don't let that take away from your edge!
nellie Come on, Pam, I know you can fail. I see failure in you.
creed Remember, you're a scumbag, so you think scummy thoughts. Like this.
pam Hello, this is pam Halpert. I'm calling from Dunder-Mifflin. Yes, your paper provider. And I just called to say. your mama is so fat, when she wears red, people yell, "Hey, kool-aid. " Yeah, your mama's fat. This is pam Halpert.
pete Did she buy it?
pam Basically I couldn't tell, but I think.
nellie Were they angry?
pam I-- I thought they were confused at least.
nellie Okay.
erin Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin. Yes, you can. Okay. I will make sure that goes on file. Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost a client!
everyone 
kevin Nice. Nice.
creed You did good. You did good.
pete See ya later, Heymont.
dwight No.
trevor If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.
oscar What the hell, Dwight?
dwight See ya later, Trevor.
oscar you are incorrigible!
dwight I just saved your life. You're welcome!
oscar You hired someone to hit me with a pipe!
angela You deserved every bit of it! You made my husband gay.
oscar What-- what I did was wrong, and I have to live with that every day. But your husband is. gay. He was gay when you married him!
angela No. No.
oscar Angela, until you face that, you're gonna be confused and angry for all the wrong reasons. But if you want to blame me for the whole thing, go ahead -- I won't stop you. Hit me. you have my blessing. Hit me.
angela Well are you gonna let go of it? Because part of the blame is definitely on you.
oscar Angela, it's a lead freaking pipe.
angela God!
oscar Aah!
angela You were supposed to be my friend.
oscar I'm so sorry. Angela--
dwight Oscar.
pete Our crowning complaint card comes to us thanks to Pamela Halpert.
everyone 
pete For insulting a client's recently deceased mother.
nellie Yes!
pam I did not know that.
pete Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
pam I'm so sorry.
meredith Wow.
pete yeah. That's-- that is terrible.
everyone 
kevin You did it.
erin Yeah!
angela I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
dwight You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid.

dwight I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey.
angela I don't like your friend Trevor.
dwight I don't like him either. And yet I really like him.

stanley Yeah.
phyllis Of course we are, Jimmy. We love you guys.
jim Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you.
pam If you're an artist, you have to be okay with the idea that you can't please everybody all the time.
hide You paint very bad--
pam Shut up, Hide! I mean, do you think kevin cares what people think about him-- or creed or Meredith? Oh my gosh, these are my role models now. You know what? I'm okay with that.
dwight Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
toby That is-- that is a loaded question.
angela My pastor said it can come from breast feeding.
toby He said that?
angela Well, he didn't fight me hard on it.
toby I-- I don't know if there's truth to-- to, uh, to that.
angela What is it called when two men intertwine their penises like the snakes on the medic-alert bracelet?
toby Oh. uh.
angela Is it called red-vining?
dwight Is it called red-vining?
toby I don't.
dwight We heard it was called red-vining.
angela People red vine.
dwight Where are gay mens' vaginas?
toby They don't have vaginas.
dwight What?
toby No. They're just regular men.
dwight When two gay men have s*x, how do they know whose pen1s will open up to accept the other person's pen1s?
toby Uh. wow. .
