And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then packer did both of them. It was awesome. So.
michael Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why. Todd

jim I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
pam You are?
pam My mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone. which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
pam I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
jim Oh yeah?
pam mmhmm.
jim Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
pam Oh really?
jim Yeah. As a child, did pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
michael Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
dwight Yes!
michael Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School".
toby Michael?
michael Yes, Toby?
toby Um. I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
michael Um. literally two seconds?
michael toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
toby The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
michael No, no, Toby. No.
toby It's really not a big deal, Michael.
michael It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
toby And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer.
michael What?
toby Just to refresh you. .
michael NO!
toby on our policy.
michael What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
toby Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
michael There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
michael Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So, take it away.
toby Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
michael I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
michael A guy goes to a five dollar. lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is what's at stake.
michael Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So. ah! Here they are. Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
darryl Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
michael Um, yeah, no, well. I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
darryl Well, those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
roy Boys R Us! Warehouse
guy Oh!
michael Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know. a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
darryl Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the. good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
michael Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
roy Hey, hey, hey.
michael What?
roy So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
michael I don't feel bad.
darryl I think he feels bad.
michael No, I don't.
roy You look like you feel bad.
michael Okay.
roy Little package!
michael Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys. Warehouse
guy Little package! Little package!
michael Thank you.
roy You look good.
darryl Hiding from his momma. Warehouse
guys 
toby So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
pam Um. I just wanted to say that. Just, my Mom's coming in today.
kevin MILF!
pam Thanks, Kevin.
pam Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
pam She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
toby Great point.
pam Thank you.
toby Um. in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um. if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
michael Hi, is it over?
toby Uh, yes!
michael No.
toby I can go over it with you.
michael I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
toby It's over.
michael Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
angela Email forwards.
michael Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
angela I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
michael Give me a break. Umm. Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
stanley That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
meredith Um. what about office romance?
toby Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
phyllis All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
michael I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
dwight Yeah, Meredith.
michael No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
dwight Yes.
michael She would have definitely slept with me.
kevin She wasn't that hot.
michael Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
toby Ok, you know, Michael. . push;
jim I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um. she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a. . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
michael What if pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? Would that be crossing the line?
toby No.
michael What if they made out? In front of everybody?
toby Well, that would be.
michael At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
toby Okay, I'm lost.
michael Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be. Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
video 
michael I wish Todd packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um. we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
jim No, thanks. I'm good.
michael That's what she said. Pam?
pam Uh. my mother's coming.
michael That's what she sai Nope, but. Okay. Well, suit yourself.
dwight Hey, Toby.
toby Hey Dwight.
dwight You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
toby Sure.
dwight Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?
toby Technically, I am in Human Resources. And dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um. I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
toby Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
dwight Good. Good. And.
toby I should get back to work.
dwight Okay. Man in
video In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'
video
 The Natural Redhead]
roy Natural redhead.
actor Hey, Rach. Redheaded
actress Hey, Joe. Mike.
actor Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
darryl Oh, Mi. ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. I banged this girl right here. This is.
roy That's her?
darryl Yes, this is the one.
roy No!
darryl You remember? Yes!
roy At the party? Warehouse
guy You banged her?
darryl Yes! Right here. You are a naughty girl!
michael Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
jan Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. Hi.
michael Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us. darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure. Todd
packer Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
pam I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks. Todd
packer Where is michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
michael So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes. Mr. O'
malley I love lawyer jokes.
michael Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
michael When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
jan You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
michael The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
jan Well, that. that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
michael Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
jan Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
michael No, I've seen the video.
toby He talked the whole time.
michael No, I didn't. Huh, what?
michael Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out. we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
jim Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
michael Mmmhmm. Yes.
jim Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so.
michael THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
jan Michael. MICHAEL!
michael Come on.
jan Michael, please. Todd
packer There he is.
michael Mwah! Todd
packer There he is. Good one.
michael You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
jan Mike. Michael. Please. I. I. really.
michael It's. That's.
jan That's not my sense of humor.
michael Okay. Hello. Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
jan Wha.
michael I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
albiny And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
michael This guy does it all.
jan 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. Michael. Mr. O'malley is your lawyer.
michael What?
jan Mr. O'malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
michael So I'm not in trouble?
michael I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
michael Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um. I think we're under an hour still, so.
albiny Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
michael I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in. Pam's
mom Um. hello.
pam Oh my god! Pam's
mom Finally made it!
pam Hello!
pam I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever. Pam's
mom This is all yours?
pam Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area. Pam's
mom Oh, my goodness. That's great. Todd
packer So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery. " She goes, "Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!" Boom!
pam This is where I used to keep my computer. Pam's
mom Oh, right! I remember.
pam But then I moved it. Pam's
mom with the picture.
pam Yeah, yeah, but I uh. I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So. Pam's
mom Sure.
pam So this is like, um, an organization station. Pam's
mom Oooooh!
pam Hey! Pam's
mom Well, there he is!
roy How are ya? Pam's
mom Hi, handsome!
roy You look great! Pam's
mom Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?
pam Well, you know. actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time. Pam's
mom Oh, I don't believe that.
roy Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies? Pam's
mom Oh, anything is fine.
roy All right, I'll see ya. Pam's
mom So which one is Jim?
pam Mom! Pam's
mom I just wanted to know.
pam No. Pam's
mom All right. Okay.
pam Ten minutes. Pam's
mom Okay.
pam Then we can go to dinner. Pam's
mom I'll make myself busy. Todd
packer There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh.
kevin Phyllis?
michael No. No, no, no. That crosses the line. Todd
packer Ex-squeeze me?
michael Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
kevin packer said it.
michael No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
phyllis I'm the same age as you, Michael.
michael I don't know about that.
phyllis We're in the same High School class.
michael Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
kevin You mean where my desk is?
michael Yes, your corner. Go.
kevin Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
michael Mmmhmmm. Todd
packer Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
michael They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.
phyllis Michael! Come on!
michael Oooh!
phyllis You don't have to worry. I'm not going to.
michael I'm not worried.
phyllis . report you to HR.
michael You know what? The only thing I'm worried about. is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
michael Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
pam He said what?
