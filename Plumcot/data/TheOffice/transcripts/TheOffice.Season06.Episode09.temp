dwight Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?
stanley Thank you.
dwight No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
andy Wow. H &amp; H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
dwight Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
phyllis This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
andy Thanks.
dwight Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.
dwight Good morning Michael.
michael Morning Dwight.
dwight Hungry?
michael No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
dwight Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
michael Well, yeah.
dwight You're thinking of deer pen1s.
michael It worked.
dwight Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. Bagel?
michael I don't mind if I do.
dwight K. I brought cheese too.
michael I'm taking one for my lady friend.
dwight Excellent.
michael Brain food. Thank you very much.
dwight Okay. You owe me.
dwight Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?
dwight Pam, would you care for a bagel?
pam Oh, no thank you.
dwight That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
pam I have an early lunch.
pam Michael's been trying to get jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out.
erin These are amazing. You took all these?
ryan I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before?
erin Oh just by like friends.
ryan Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
helene Whoohoo! Pammy?
pam Hey! Hey. Happy birthday.
helene Thank you.
michael My girls. There they are.
michael Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food.
angela Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
pam I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
michael Yeah--
kevin Hi.

helene Tell her how you gave it to me.
michael No, that wouldn't be--
helene He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning. What a nice way to wake up.
michael Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
kevin Because of s*x?
michael Hey--
pam Kevin!
michael Please, Kevin. You're fired. Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?
pam Yes, let's go.
erin Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you pam and they say it's urgent.
pam Oh, you guys. Just one second. Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch.
jim Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too.
pam I know. Isn't that always how it goes?
jim Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.
pam I want to handle it.
jim That's okay.
pam I feel like its--
jim It's my pleasure. Hello? Well that's great. Turns out the paper was there all along.
creed Thank God.
creed Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive.
helene So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales?
pam Yeah-- it's exciting.
helene Well, you know-- michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.
jim Pam's sales are fine actually.
michael Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
pam Thank you.
michael Today is about family.
pam Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
andy Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you.
dwight Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
andy Yes! And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
dwight Wow--
andy Feel it against your cheek.
dwight I will.
andy You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness.
dwight Let me get that door for you--
andy Whoa--
dwight There you go!
andy Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you.
dwight Oh. goodness. thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
andy Is that right?
dwight Observe.
andy Huh.
dwight Right?
andy That really works.
dwight Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay.
andy Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
dwight And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
andy Whoa-- thank you very much. Oh boy.
dwight Thank you very much for that.
andy You are very welcome.
dwight Have a seat. Allow me.
andy Have a seat yourself.
dwight You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
andy Not necessary.
dwight No, no, no!
andy You didn't have to do that.
dwight andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.
michael Hello. Scott. Table for four.
hostess Welcome Scott family. It'll be just a moment.
pam I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe michael will start dating that too.
michael What table should we take? So many to choose from.
jim Wow.
helene Oh my God!
michael What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!
pam Michael, you did all this?
michael Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
helene Well, thank you. All of you.
michael Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
helene Oh you'll love it. You can have my guide books. I think I'm done with those really long plane rides.
michael Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
pam So, mom. which birthday are we celebrating this year?
helene Sticking with 49.
pam 49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.
michael That's funny.
helene Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?
jim Oh, burn. Burn on you. and a little bit on me, too.
michael You're 54 years old.
helene No. I'm 58.
michael You're 58 years old?
helene Uh huh.
michael Congratulations.
michael The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave.
pam Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
helene Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.
pam Please be Grandma.
jim Definitely Grandma.
pam I want you to be Grandma.
helene Oh, michael what do you think? Grandma?
michael That--
pam Yay, Grandma!
michael Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
pam Maybe.
michael Helene?
helene Oh, oh no. I don't think so.
michael I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?
helene Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out. It just-- doesn't interest me.
michael So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done.
helene Hmm. I might have done it when I was younger, but now there's just other things I'd rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming--
michael Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
helene Oh--
michael You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?
helene No, no.
michael Snowboarding?
helene You want to go snowboarding?
michael I might.
helene Michael, what are you talking about?
michael Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
michael Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.
andy Aye-yi-yi!
dwight What's going on in here?
oscar andy bought lunch.
dwight Oh. no. really?
andy Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
dwight There is no book. There's only a survival guide.
andy You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
dwight Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
michael So we should get the check?
pam What about your gift Michael?
michael Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.
helene I'm sure I won't.
michael Yes you will.
pam He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
helene Gimme. Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word love on it in every language.
pam Aww--
michael I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.
helene A scrapbook of our first memories by michael Gary Scott. For my girlfriend helene on your birthday.
michael That's just an arbitrary title.
helene Ok, there's a penny. What's that from?
jim Penny for your thoughts.
helene It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it.
jim Wow.
pam That's amazing.
michael It's not amazing. at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
helene A poem!
michael Oh that I plagiarized I think.
helene I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay.
jim Shel Silverstein.
pam Yeah.
helene Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.
pam That's really nice Michael.
michel I think it sucks.
helene I think it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
michael Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.
helene God. it's a scrapbook.
pam Home run Michael.
jim You set the bar so high.
michael That was a bunt. . push;
andy Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this.
dwight Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered.
andy No, I insist.
dwight No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.
andy Ok, dwight this is ridiculous.
dwight Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.
pam Hey. Where'd you go?
michael Oh, just went to the bathroom.
pam And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
michael I got thirsty.
pam Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake.
michael Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself.
pam Cakes really good.
helene Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting.
michael Finish your cake, Helene.
helene Hmmm?
michael I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
michael helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
pam Michael. michael , it's okay.
michael No it's not.
pam I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy.
michael Wow. That just-- you've really grown.
pam Well--
michael Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy. and skydiving. and bungee jumping.
jim Okay, so--
michael And I want kids. And you. unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
pam Michael.
michael It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer-- -- tility.
helene I, um-- I got it.
helene I'm 58. What am I supposed to do now?
michael Well, hobbies--
jim Stop.
andy Ahh.
dwight What's going on?
andy Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.
dwight Alright, move it.
andy What if dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.
dwight Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
andy It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
dwight Got it. To Dwight. Wha-- Starbucks gift card.
andy Surprise! It's from everybody. $15 value.
dwight Dammit. I am no closer to taking jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.
michael Pamela Beesly Halpert--
pam What?
michael May I have a word with you in my office please?
pam I am working.
michael Well, this is a work related matter.
pam Really?
michael Yes.
pam Really?
michael Yes. Join me please, won't you? I am going to give you a raise.
pam Why?
michael Because of all the good work you've done.
pam I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
michael That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.
pam I have the worst attitude of any person here.
michael Do you want the raise or what?
pam Yeah, I'll take it.
michael Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
pam You're bribing me?
michael No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough. your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
pam I want to hit you.
michael What?
pam I want to hit you. I'll do that.
michael Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
pam No. Are you kidding?
michael Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
pam No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.
michael Okay.
pam So, um. we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
michael Okay.
pam Okay.
michael Okay.
pam See you then.
michael See you.
ryan Hey.
michael Hey.
ryan Quick question.
kelly Yeah.
ryan Are you scared?
michael Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--
ryan We heard about the punch.
michael What punch?
kelly Pam. She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
michael I'm pretty sure we said slap.
kelly No, it's a punch and pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
ryan I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you?
michael I-- mmm-- I'm good.
ryan alright. See you there.
michael Hey.
jim Hey.
michael Do you and pam ever get frisky?
jim Inappropriate.
michael I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
jim All the time.
michael Really?
jim Yeah.
michael She strong?
jim She wants it bad Michael.
michael Can you stop this?
jim I can.
michael Okay.
jim And I don't support her choice to hit you.
michael I don't either.
jim But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
michael Mmm-hmm. I know.
jim I just need some time.
michael You gotta do something--
jim I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
michael How much time do you think you'll need?
jim No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.
michael Come on, man!
toby Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
pam Oh.
toby I heard about the hit. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
pam Right.
toby Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
pam Okay.
toby Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm. Pow!
pam Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
toby Yes.
pam Okay.
toby Yes.
pam Wow!
toby Okay.
meredith Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
kevin My money's on Pam.
oscar It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be?
kevin michael could win.
oscar How? He can't hit back.
kevin Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
michael Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it. Let's do this.
michael It's okay guys. I can handle this. Everybody can go home.
kevin We're here for the show, Michael.
michael You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
kelly It has almost no calories.
pam Are you ready?
michael Yes.
pam You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
michael I know. Okay. Alright. Oh-- God!
pam Michael, you have to put your hands down.
angela Put your hands in your pockets.
michael Okay! Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
pam What are you sorry for?
michael So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
pam How about for dating my mom?
michael Maybe that--
pam And dumping her on her birthday.
michael Yes.
pam Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
michael Okay. I promise. For the record your mom came on to me.
phyllis Holy crap.
pam Are you okay?
michael No!
pam You're okay.
jim Feel better?
pam No. You were right.
dwight Wait, why are you limping?
michael I don't know.
dwight Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
michael As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And pam and jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.
michael Ahh.
dwight Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down.
michael Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.
dwight Fire Jim.
michael No.
dwight I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.
michael What are you talking about--
dwight Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.
michael Forget that.
dwight Can I have an office?
michael No.
dwight You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.
michael Oh that feels better.
