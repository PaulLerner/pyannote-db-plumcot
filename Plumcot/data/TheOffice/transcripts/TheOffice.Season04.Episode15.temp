pam What's wrong Michael?
michael I got gum in my hair.
pam You do.
michael This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
dwight You've got a ton of dandruff.
michael OK, let me be.
jim How'd you get gum in your hair?
michael I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
jim But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
michael Kill me. right now.
pam We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
michael I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
jim Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
pam No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
michael Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.
michael Smells good.
dwight Taste good too.
michael Oh don't. That's disgusting.
dwight Wow! Lot of calories.
michael Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.
dwight Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
michael 
michael I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude. that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just. They just lack a certain. Crawfordness.
oscar I am livid, Absolutely livid.
angela It's ridiculous.
ryan Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
ryan My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
jim Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
ryan Love it. Go.
jim Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
ryan I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
jim Thanks.
ryan David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
jim Did I? I don't.
ryan You did. Yeah.
jim Hmm.
ryan Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
michael Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or.
ryan Ok thanks Michael.
michael Yeah.
ryan I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
dwight Question.
ryan Dwight.
dwight Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
ryan This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
stanley I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
ryan I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
stanley When will that be?
ryan TBD. Phyllis?
phyllis Did the police solve the problem with the.
ryan Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
ryan Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
dwight I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
jim Yeah, I actually have to agree with dwight on that one.
ryan It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
jim And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?"
creed I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
kelly If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
ryan Do you have a question Kelly?
kelly Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
michael ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
michael Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
ryan You too.
michael Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.
ryan michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
michael Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
ryan Na.
michael Na?
ryan Sorry man.
michael Well you tried.
ryan But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
michael Yeah.
ryan Unreal.
michael They sound great.
ryan Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
michael Would you have s*x with Meredith?
jim What?
michael Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
jim I'm gonna go to my desk.
michael Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that.
jim I know.
michael Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
jim I can't.
michael Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
jim I'm not single.
michael Who you dating?
jim Pam.
michael That's still going on?
michael Ok, dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with ryan and to meet girls.
dwight Yeah!
andy Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
angela I'm right here.
dwight No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
michael Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
angela We get it.
michael I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
dwight With s*x!
michael That's. I, I think that.
jim You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
jim So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas. the one time a year they hear one.
michael Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
michael Place is packed.
dwight Fire hazard.
michael Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
dwight Women look like white slaves.
michael No, they're just hotties.
ryan I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
michael Hey.
ryan Michael.

jim Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
pam You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
stanley Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
pam There is a master key and a spare key for the office. dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks. "
ryan Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
michael Hey, nice to meet you.

pam Aw! That's great Toby.
toby It's so random that I have it.
pam Toby, you're the best.

kevin Way to go, man.
kelly Now he's never gonna come.
andy By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than jim and Pam?
pam Phyllis.
michael I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting "Back to the Future.
