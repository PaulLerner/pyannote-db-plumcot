dwight Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
michael I like it.
dwight Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
jim I don't know. Is it classy enough?
dwight Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
jim I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
michael I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
jim And of course, classy.
michael And classy, yeah.
dwight Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
jim Last week, dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
dwight Oh, here's
one a string quartet, playing classy-cal music.
michael You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
jim That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
michael Yes.
dwight Mr. Peanut is not classy.
michael He is.
dwight He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
michael That's what makes him classy.
dwight Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
jim Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
dwight Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
jim Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my
head an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
michael Strawberries?
jim That's inspired.
dwight I said that!
pam Not classy.
michael Not classy at all.
jim De class√©.
michael French. Classy.
pam Hi, can I help you?
charles Yeah, I'm charles Miner, here to see michael Scott.
pam Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
michael Yes?
pam Michael, there's a charles Miner here to see you.
michael Miner? I hardly know her!. Hello?
pam Yeah, are you coming out now?
michael Uh-huh. Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince charles Miner. At your service. Everybody, this is Sir charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. Here he is.
charles I-I was-
michael Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
jim Hey.
michael Yes.
jim Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
michael What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
jim Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
michael You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
dwight Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
michael Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
dwight We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is.
michael Surprise! As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.
charles Thank you.
michael Took me all night.
pam This is what you did last night?
michael I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
kelly My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
angela Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
jim Hey, how you doing? jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
charles Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
jim I didn't think you'd notice. Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
charles Uh.
jim Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer. uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that. so, uh.
charles Your name is Jim?
jim jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it.
pam He just had to wear his tux today.
jim I thought it'd be funny.
pam Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
michael All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
charles Hey, I come from accounting, too.
michael Oh, nerd alert!
kevin Ni-
michael This is oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
charles Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
michael This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange
andy Hey-o!
michael There you go! Where's the other?
charles You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
michael Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at kevin and he has no sexual history.
kevin Hey!
charles How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
michael Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for charles Miner.
charles Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
michael Oh! Well.
charles That's great.
michael Above and beyond.
charles Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
michael That's true.
charles But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
stanley stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
michael No. Absolutely not.
charles Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
oscar Do you have specifics?
charles Sp-Well, um, michael should have filled you in last week.
michael Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
charles You didn't tell them.
michael Well, why don't-
charles Yeah, I will. What I told michael last week-
michael charles is going to tell you.
charles Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
stanley Fantastic.
michael Well, it's not official.
charles It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
michael Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
charles No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
michael Well-
dwight What about your party?
michael Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
charles Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
michael Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
charles No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
michael I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
michael David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
david What gave you that idea?
michael It was my understanding.
david I see.
michael Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
david Look, Michael, charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
michael But the branch is still mine?
david You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let charles know.
dwight Ask him about the party.
michael Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
david I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
dwight No the other thing.
michael Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?
dwight He hung up?
david No.
michael I just got off the horn with david Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
charles No.
michael Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
charles Saticoy Steel.
michael Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
charles No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
michael You're not from paper?
charles No.
michael Does david know this?
charles Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
michael Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
charles And what is that?
michael And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so. Are we clear?
charles That's not how I plan on doing things.
michael Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
charles I'll tell david what he needs to know. Sorry. david wants it this way.
michael Whatever david wants.
charles Ok. . push;
michael michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
dwight Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em.
stephanie david Wallace's office.
dwight Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
stephanie Good. Thank you.
dwight How's it hanging?
stephanie Alright. . .
dwight Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael. Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got david Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
michael No! You idiot! Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.
stephanie david Wallace's office.
michael Hi Stephanie, it's michael Scott again. I just spoke with michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
stephanie Michael.
michael And I really really need to talk to David.
stephanie Please hold.
charles charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
michael I was never given a name.
pam Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
charles Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
angela That is so unnecessary!
michael Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
charles It's no big deal.
michael I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
charles You still have that option.
angela Thanks again, Charles.
kelly Thank you.
michael Nobody thanked me.
jim Thanks, Charles.
michael For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
charles I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
michael Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
kelly Should I seduce him?
angela No. No one wants to see that.
kevin Michael?
michael Yep.
kevin I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
michael Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
charles Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
kevin Ok.
charles Ok.
michael Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
charles That's not the way it's gonna work.
michael Yes it is!
charles No, it is not.
michael No, it is not.
charles Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
michael Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
charles Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
michael Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
charles No, seriously.
michael No, seriously.
charles How old are you?
michael How old are you?
pam Oh no.
pam I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
charles Five years old?
michael Five years old?
andy Duuudes, stop.
employees Not a good idea, Michael. Michael, stop. Stop doing that. Stop it. You're going to get all of us in trouble.
charles I will walk away.
michael I'm gonna walk away.
andy Stop doing that!
michael I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
pam And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
michael What is that smaller stripper holding?
pam Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
michael Ok.
charles What exactly is the PPC?
phyllis Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
charles Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
michael Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
charles This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
michael Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
jim No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
charles Whatcha got, Jim?. What is a two-way petting zoo?
jim You pet the animals and they pet you back.
michael It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
pam It's really just a regular shaped cake.
michael But it's cool, and it's-
charles This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
michael Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
charles Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
michael Yeah, why don't you do that?
charles Thank you very much.
michael Yeah, here we go. Ok.
charles Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
michael What?
charles Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
michael 
newsflash I've been here for fifteen years.
headline You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
charles I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
michael Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to david Wallace. I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it.
charles Come in.
jim Hey.
charles Hey.
jim Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker. And a great number two for the office.
charles Number two?
jim Second-in-command to Michael.
charles Oh, I didn't know that position existed.
jim Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and michael gave it to me.
charles So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
jim Assistant regional manager, yeah.
charles Any responsibilities come with it?
jim No, not exactly.
charles So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
jim Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
charles Yeah, would you, uh?
jim Yep.
michael Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he?
david Michael.
michael So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
david How did you get here, Michael?
michael I drove.
david Ok.
michael Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.
david Michael. Listen-
michael Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
david Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
michael Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
david That's not exactly-
michael Clearly that's what you wanted.
david No.
michael Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
david Yes.
michael I've put having a family on hold.
david We didn't ask you to do that.
michael And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
charles Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
andy Cool.
dwight Excellent.
angela It was very nice meeting you, charles Miner.
jim See ya. See ya. Bye!
jim And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
kelly I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
phyllis It's just me here.
kelly I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
phyllis I think he left.
kelly What?! Move!
angela Hello, Charles? Charles!
kelly Hey! Is that his scarf?
angela No!
angela charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
michael I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.
david Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
michael Ok.
david We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
michael I quit.
david What?
michael You have no idea how high I can fly.
