andy_bernard Erin.
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I'm not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.
erin_hannon Who's calling?
andy_bernard Nobody. Just say that I'm- Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I'm going to refuse to take it.
erin_hannon You're not going to take it?
andy_bernard Just make up a phone call. It's not a real call. Make it up.
erin_hannon Ohohohoh.
andy_bernard And come and tell me. Doesn't matter what it is.
erin_hannon You're not going to get it though?
andy_bernard I'm not going to take it. And then he's going to be like "whoa this is a really important meeting".
erin_hannon Copy that.
andy_bernard Okay.
andy_bernard Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I'll tell you how we can beat it.
meredith_palmer Uh well we've been going with...
erin_hannon Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah.
erin_hannon You have a very important call.
andy_bernard I'm sorry – I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait.
erin_hannon Are you sure? It's really, really important.
andy_bernard There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.
erin_hannon Really? Because your mother is dead.
meredith_palmer Oh my God.
andy_bernard I don't think she's dead.
erin_hannon She's dead. She was hit by a bus.
andy_bernard She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
erin_hannon This isn't one of those times. It's the police. They said it's the worst they've ever seen.
dwight_schrute Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
meredith_palmer Oh you must take this call. It's...
andy_bernard Yeah. Um line 1?
erin_hannon Line 2.
andy_bernard Hi.
darryl_philbin It's Darryl. Erin told me to pretend to be a cop and say your mom died.
andy_bernard Ooh, gosh!
darryl_philbin Dude.
andy_bernard Officer.
darryl_philbin Look man this is a bad idea.
andy_bernard Did she have any last words or?
darryl_philbin Really? That is messed up man.
andy_bernard Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.
darryl_philbin You're a bad man Andy Bernard.
andy_bernard That is so mom.
darryl_philbin That stuff can come back to get you. It's called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle...
andy_bernard Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?
pam_beesly Hey Cathy.
cathy_simms Hi.
pam_beesly How's it going? Everything make sense?
cathy_simms I think everything is under control.
pam_beesly Great.
cathy_simms You should sit down.
pam_beesly Oh no, I'm fine.
cathy_simms No I should go fill out my paperwork.
pam_beesly Ok Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.
dwight_schrute Oh we know.
pam_beesly I'm training a temp to be my replacement while I'm on maternity leave. Oh I should've mentioned I'm pregnant. You probably didn't notice because it's impossible to tell I'm so small. But yeah I'm pregnant. Oh come on!
ryan_howard Hey – asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
jim_halpert Hmm. Doubt it.
ryan_howard Yeah me too.
pam_beesly You doubt it?
jim_halpert What's that?
pam_beesly Why do you doubt that she's single?
jim_halpert Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right?
darryl_philbin What are you doing with my lunch?
andy_bernard I'm delivering it from the fridge. It's like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?
darryl_philbin It's not pizza.
andy_bernard Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
darryl_philbin I like the sound of that. Is Kevin in?
andy_bernard Uh you tell me
ryan_howard So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
gabe_lewis Well he's probably a drug dealer. That's the best way to land a hot girlfriend. You just uh get her hooked on blow.
toby_flenderson It's going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
oscar_martinez Yeah aesthetically speaking she adds a nice presence.
Offscreen#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode07 Good energy
pam_beesly It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh?
oscar_martinez No, no. Not even.
pam_beesly I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing.
oscar_martinez Pam you look more beautiful now than ever.
toby_flenderson Radiant.
pam_beesly Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.
phyllis_vance Yeah you have this sexy glow.
gabe_lewis It's one of the most common fetishes.
pam_beesly Really well thank you all.
toby_flenderson You know it's not just pregnant women who don't get their due. You know who's gorgeous? Helen Mirren.
ryan_howard Yes! Have you seen her in a bikini? Amazing?
toby_flenderson You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It's a pregnant Helen Mirren.
dwight_schrute Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
oscar_martinez In this case yes.
dwight_schrute No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
phyllis_vance No we're not.
dwight_schrute Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
andy_bernard Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.
darryl_philbin Nice scatting, man.
andy_bernard Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.
val Not bad fellas, you're better than you look.
kevin_malone Hey, screw you!
andy_bernard Hey Robert, are we meeting early?
robert_california Just taking a stroll. What exactly have I stumbled upon here?
andy_bernard Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.
robert_california You're a band.
andy_bernard Thank you.
kevin_malone We're called Kevin and the Zits.
darryl_philbin That was never agreed upon.
robert_california I miss being in a band.
andy_bernard Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!
kevin_malone I have a tambourine.
robert_california Tambourine? You know I'm the CEO, right?
andy_bernard CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.
robert_california I play harmonica. I think I have one in the car.
andy_bernard Great!
kevin_malone Nice guys, Robert is going to be a Zit!
darryl_philbin Again, never agreed upon.
andy_bernard I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!
darryl_philbin Usually that life is short and tragic. That's okay, right?
andy_bernard Yeah, even cooler.
kevin_malone We all got to go sometime.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Helen Mirren. Hot?
jim_halpert Yeah. Super pretty.
pam_beesly Huh. What about Cathy?
jim_halpert The temp?
pam_beesly Yeah. Do you think she's hot?
jim_halpert Nope.
pam_beesly I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?
jim_halpert And I'm telling you, I don't.
pam_beesly You don't find Cathy attractive?
jim_halpert No, I don't.
jim_halpert No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.
pam_beesly Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.
jim_halpert Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good?
dwight_schrute That's just absurd.
pam_beesly Yes, because she's hot, right?
dwight_schrute Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
pam_beesly The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
pam_beesly Dwight, am I hot right now?
dwight_schrute Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
pam_beesly What about before? Was I attractive before?
dwight_schrute Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
pam_beesly Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
dwight_schrute You think Jim's lying? That's so cute. I know he's lying.
pam_beesly Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
dwight_schrute Done. I never touch a pregnant woman.
pam_beesly Yep, that's the Dwight I need.
dwight_schrute If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
pam_beesly Okay.
dwight_schrute Rule one our only loyalty is to the truth.
pam_beesly I think so. Okay.
dwight_schrute Rule two we stop at nothing.
pam_beesly Well, what does that... is that... okay.
dwight_schrute Rule three Don't fall in love.
pam_beesly Yep, good.
dwight_schrute We're gonna bust this guy.
pam_beesly Honesty is very important to me.
dwight_schrute So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
pam_beesly Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
kelly_kapoor Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
dwight_schrute None taken. What do you got?
kelly_kapoor It is called the matchmaker test, and it is very powerful. Basically we have Pam ask Jim which of his friends he would set up with Cathy. If Jim picks a really hot friend, then we know that he thinks that Cathy's hot.
pam_beesly Hmm.
robert_california Hey, you found us!
curtis_dorough You guys sound great, man.
robert_california Darryl, Andy, Kevin, this is Curtis Dorough, local musician and the officiate at my wedding.
darryl_philbin Local musician? Local legend! I used to come hear you play every week at the Deerhead.
kevin_malone Dude, you're on TV! You're the sportscaster on channel seven.
drummer Go Eagles!
kevin_malone You do that on TV!
robert_california You guys mind if they join us?
andy_bernard Yeah, absolutely!
kevin_malone Guys, I've got some instruments right here.
darryl_philbin Hey, why don't you and me play those?
kevin_malone Yeah? Okay, this is awesome.
robert_california What should we play?
kevin_malone Maybe we should warm up with some scales?
robert_california Midnight Rambler?
curtis_dorough Yeah.
andy_bernard Midnight what?
curtis_dorough Have you heard about the midnight rambler? Hey, come on in, baby. Yeah!
pam_beesly Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.
jim_halpert Oh, I stand corrected.
pam_beesly I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?
jim_halpert Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
pam_beesly Mike Tibbets, really?
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
ryan_howard Hey, who's this Mike Tibbets guy? What kind of car does he drive?
jim_halpert Not his mom's car.
ryan_howard Yeah, 'cause his mom's car's probably not a Nissan Z.
jim_halpert Touche?
kelly_kapoor Eww!
pam_beesly Kelly, calm down.
kelly_kapoor I mean, I guess he'd be okay with hair. Okay, you should see if he'll get hair plugs.
pam_beesly I don't think Jim cares about his hair.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
dwight_schrute I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
pam_beesly Jim's on to me.
dwight_schrute Hmm?
pam_beesly Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
dwight_schrute Just ugly enough to have deniability.
pam_beesly Yep.
jim_halpert Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
dwight_schrute Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
kelly_kapoor I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
pam_beesly No, Kelly, don't.
dwight_schrute The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
pam_beesly and Kelly With the crotch?
dwight_schrute With the crotch.
kevin_malone Whoo!
dwight_schrute Psst. We're not here.
creed_bratton Who said that?
dwight_schrute Exactly.
creed_bratton How'd I get this long triangle?
dwight_schrute Okay, just shut it.
pam_beesly Is he puffing out his chest?
dwight_schrute I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
pam_beesly No. Maybe he just said something funny.
dwight_schrute Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
pam_beesly I think he's just making her laugh.
dwight_schrute Time for me to find out.
pam_beesly Why's he making her laugh so much?
dwight_schrute Just going to walk over here- whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!
jim_halpert Dwight!
cathy_simms Are you okay?
dwight_schrute I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
jim_halpert Dwight! Dwight!
dwight_schrute Yes? Wha- Jim.
jim_halpert Sorry about that.
dwight_schrute Aw, cramp, I'm just-
jim_halpert Dwight! Why?
dwight_schrute I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
jim_halpert Leave.
dwight_schrute Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft pen1s for nothing.
pam_beesly Why was he making her laugh so much?
pam_beesly Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.
cathy_simms Yeah, take your time.
pam_beesly Okay.
cathy_simms Oh, that line from Zoolander?
jim_halpert Mm-hmm?
cathy_simms It was from a deleted scene so we were both right.
jim_halpert Told you.
cathy_simms Um, do I hand in my expense reports to a particular accountant or-
pam_beesly Oscar, Cathy has a question!
cathy_simms Sorry, um, I'll just go ask Oscar.
pam_beesly Yeah?
jim_halpert You okay?
pam_beesly Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.
jim_halpert Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
pam_beesly Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.
dwight_schrute She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
pam_beesly Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.
dwight_schrute And she called it nuts?
darryl_philbin Seriously, that was hot. Feel like you and the newsman had a groove going.
kevin_malone Mm-hmm.
andy_bernard Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?
kevin_malone Are you serious? From Star Trek?
darryl_philbin Hey, you caught some of that?
val I caught it.
darryl_philbin What, you don't like the blues?
val I might enjoy seeing you guys play the blues.
andy_bernard Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us.
val I think the music left without you.
dwight_schrute Come on.
jim_halpert Stop shoving me.
dwight_schrute Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my pen1s. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.
old_man Man Uh, are you all in line?
dwight_schrute Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
jim_halpert Si.
pam_beesly Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?
dwight_schrute We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
old_man Man You have to share the machine with others.
dwight_schrute Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
jim_halpert Okay, Dwight, come on. You can go first.
old_man Man Thank you.
dwight_schrute Jim, are you serious?
jim_halpert Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
andy_bernard Maybe we could switch instruments.
kevin_malone Yeah.
andy_bernard 'Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.
darryl_philbin Yeah, maybe everyone move one instrument to the right?
andy_bernard We had to leave because of creative differences.
darryl_philbin Yeah they kind of had a specific sound that didn't really fit in with our thing.
kevin_malone Guys, this means they're Kevin and the Zits now.
darryl_philbin No man, we are.
andy_bernard Well-
darryl_philbin No, no, no.
dwight_schrute Okay, you're done.
old_man Man I have a new heart, you know.
dwight_schrute Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
jim_halpert No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.
dwight_schrute Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Yep, he's lying.
pam_beesly Ah, see, was that so hard?
jim_halpert I am not lying.
pam_beesly Really?
jim_halpert Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
dwight_schrute I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
pam_beesly Wait, what?
dwight_schrute Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
pam_beesly Jim, you have high blood pressure.
dwight_schrute Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
pam_beesly Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?
jim_halpert Yeah, but I don't smoke.
pam_beesly When was the last time you went to the doctor?
jim_halpert I don't know.
dwight_schrute It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
pam_beesly Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?
jim_halpert Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
dwight_schrute It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.
dwight_schrute Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
pam_beesly Just go home. It doesn't matter.
dwight_schrute But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.
jim_halpert Thank you.
andy_bernard and Darryl Oh baby I love your way.
darryl_philbin Every day.
andy_bernard and Darryl Wanna be with you night and day.
darryl_philbin and Kevin And day.
andy_bernard and Darryl Oh baby I love your way.
andy_bernard Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.
