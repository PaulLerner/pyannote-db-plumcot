michael_scott Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. Jan made me breakfast this morning... well she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours.
michael_scott This is going to be a very good year. Very good. Jan is at home. Jim is back. My protege Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um... Andy and Dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed.
sadiq Tech Guy You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer?
pam_beesly It was for a video.
sadiq Tech Guy Yeah, what kind of video?
pam_beesly A celebrity s*x tape.
jim_halpert Really, what kind of celebrity?
pam_beesly Not relevant.
jim_halpert How much did you pay for it?
pam_beesly Not relevant.
jim_halpert You paid for it?
pam_beesly It all happened so fast.
jim_halpert I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh... it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
pam_beesly Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
kevin_malone Are you kidding me, Pam and Jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right?
oscar_martinez I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
kevin_malone Are you kidding me?
pam_beesly And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
jim_halpert Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
pam_beesly Cool.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Well have fun with that.
michael_scott Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute Where?
michael_scott It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
stanley_hudson What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
oscar_martinez So she's really going to be fine?
michael_scott Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
pam_beesly Thank God you were there.
michael_scott Yeah.
andy_bernard Did you see who did it?
dwight_schrute No need we can just check the security tapes.
michael_scott Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
jim_halpert Who was driving?
pam_beesly Oh, Michael.
jim_halpert One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
dwight_schrute It's only Meredith.
michael_scott Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
dwight_schrute Hey... Why did you do it?
michael_scott It was an accident.
dwight_schrute Was she talkin' back?
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
pam_beesly Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
kevin_malone Who's we, you and Jim?
pam_beesly No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.
kevin_malone Oh, I bet Jim goes too.
pam_beesly Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.
kevin_malone Oh, I bet you ask?
pam_beesly I was planning on it.
kevin_malone I bet you were.
pam_beesly Angela?
oscar_martinez Subtle.
kevin_malone What
pam_beesly Are you coming?
angela_martin I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
angela_martin She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks... about Sprinkles.
angela_martin I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
pam_beesly Can't your other cats keep her company.
angela_martin There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
pam_beesly Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
angela_martin All right!
michael_scott My lord my liege.
ryan_howard Yes Michael?
michael_scott So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
michael_scott So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
ryan_howard Back? Why is that Michael?
michael_scott Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
ryan_howard Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
michael_scott No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
ryan_howard Did this happen on company property?
michael_scott Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
ryan_howard I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
michael_scott Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is we are fine?
ryan_howard
ryan_howard People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but... it's a weird word.
angela_martin Hey D.
dwight_schrute Hey monkey, what's up?
angela_martin Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
dwight_schrute Sure.
angela_martin I have to visit the alchy.
dwight_schrute Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
angela_martin I wouldn't put it past her.
dwight_schrute So what do you need me to do?
angela_martin I wrote it out.
dwight_schrute Mm-hmm.
angela_martin There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um... and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
michael_scott Ok, I have an announcement.
oscar_martinez You pushed Darryl out the window?
michael_scott No.
phyllis_vance You shot Dwight?
michael_scott No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
jim_halpert Oh good, so we don't have to work.
pam_beesly OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
michael_scott So, like a freedom tree.
pam_beesly I can take 3 people.
jim_halpert I can also take 3 people.
oscar_martinez Separate cars.
michael_scott Pam.
pam_beesly Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
michael_scott Pam.
pam_beesly Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
michael_scott Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
pam_beesly I...
michael_scott Excellent!
pam_beesly I was thinking that we...
michael_scott Good work Pam.
pam_beesly But...
michael_scott Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
stanley_hudson You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
michael_scott Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
michael_scott Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.
michael_scott Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.
kelly_kapoor She looks awful.
michael_scott No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
jim_halpert I think she's awake.
michael_scott No... She's in a coma.
nurse No.
michael_scott OK... Meredith, Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
meredith_palmer At the same time.
michael_scott Yeah.
stanley_hudson Hello Meredith.
meredith_palmer This is weird.
michael_scott Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
kevin_malone Whoa!
michael_scott Nurse.
meredith_palmer No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
michael_scott I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
jim_halpert I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
nurse What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.
meredith_palmer Thanks.
kevin_malone
phyllis_vance Does it hurt terribly?
meredith_palmer No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
creed_bratton Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What...
meredith_palmer I have no idea.
creed_bratton Oh.
meredith_palmer Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
michael_scott Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
meredith_palmer Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
michael_scott Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
angela_martin No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
michael_scott Well, just shhhh... just just...
meredith_palmer You cracked my pelvis
michael_scott Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
meredith_palmer You're not forgiven.
michael_scott Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
pam_beesly Michael! Michael!
meredith_palmer
michael_scott Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
angela_martin Hey.
dwight_schrute Hey monkey.
angela_martin Any problems?
dwight_schrute Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
angela_martin What!?
dwight_schrute Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
angela_martin Sprinkles.
dwight_schrute That was the sick one, right?
angela_martin Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
dwight_schrute No.
angela_martin Did she look... When you saw her how was she looking?
dwight_schrute Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
angela_martin
dwight_schrute So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
angela_martin Alright.
dwight_schrute Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
angela_martin
pam_beesly It's gonna be OK.
michael_scott OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
pam_beesly Michael, Angela's cat died.
michael_scott Sprinkles?
angela_martin
michael_scott Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the p0rn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
michael_scott Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.
michael_scott Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
oscar_martinez Like what?
michael_scott Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
toby_flenderson No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so... uh, I got a week of free pies.
pam_beesly That's cool.
toby_flenderson Yeah.
michael_scott Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
angela_martin Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
dwight_schrute She's only a cat.
angela_martin You never... you don't like them.
dwight_schrute Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
oscar_martinez Dwight please!
michael_scott Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
dwight_schrute No, I have not.
michael_scott Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
dwight_schrute I do not respect her, but I will go.
michael_scott Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
toby_flenderson Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
michael_scott Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
toby_flenderson Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
michael_scott Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
stanley_hudson I'm... um, Catholic.
michael_scott OK.
darryl_philbin Presbyterian.
michael_scott Alright.
pam_beesly Oh me too.
darryl_philbin Oh?
pam_beesly Same religion.
darryl_philbin Alright!
phyllis_vance I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
angela_martin That's why we're cursed.
creed_bratton I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
michael_scott Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
kelly_kapoor That's Buddhist.
michael_scott Are you sure?
kelly_kapoor No.
michael_scott What are you?
sadiq Tech Guy Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.
michael_scott OK, 1 Sikh, and...
dwight_schrute As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
dwight_schrute Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
meredith_palmer Don't pull any plugs.
doctor How are you doing Ms. Palmer?
meredith_palmer Better.
doctor Excellent.
dwight_schrute Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
doctor Um... I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but...
dwight_schrute Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
doctor Ah, so uh... so that is where her uterus went... Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?
meredith_palmer Yes. Dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
dwight_schrute Just doing my job.
doctor It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?
meredith_palmer And a rat. Separate occasions.
michael_scott You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.
kelly_kapoor If there was a God then Ryan and I would be married by now.
michael_scott Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
jim_halpert I will do some research.
pam_beesly I can help you with that.
dwight_schrute So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
michael_scott Oh God, Rabies?
dwight_schrute Mm-hmm.
michael_scott I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
dwight_schrute No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
michael_scott This place is so cursed.
dwight_schrute Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
michael_scott I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
jim_halpert Six of one, really.
michael_scott Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
michael_scott Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?
kevin_malone Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&J. Pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
pam_beesly I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
pam_beesly Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
michael_scott Pro-Am.
pam_beesly Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.
michael_scott A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
stanley_hudson No, rabies... Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
michael_scott Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
stanley_hudson Zero.
michael_scott Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
andy_bernard Isn't that your money?
michael_scott That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
phyllis_vance Oh, it's coming.
michael_scott Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
kevin_malone Michael?
michael_scott Yes.
kevin_malone You cannot make me run.
michael_scott OK.
kevin_malone It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
michael_scott Alright, alright.
kevin_malone You didn't run for me...
michael_scott Shhh...
kevin_malone ...when I thought I had skin cancer.
michael_scott I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
kevin_malone No.
michael_scott OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
kevin_malone I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
michael_scott Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
andy_bernard I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions.
andy_bernard Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat.
angela_martin This is Sprinkles. She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, just a couple of kittens out on the town.
angela_martin Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
pam_beesly What's wrong?
angela_martin I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe Dwight killed my cat.
pam_beesly Hmm...
angela_martin When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
pam_beesly Ah.
angela_martin Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
pam_beesly Angela, I'm sorry.
angela_martin Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
pam_beesly I'm more of a dog person.
angela_martin
jim_halpert So what's your strategy for this race?
pam_beesly Well I'm gonna start fast.
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
pam_beesly Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Then I'm gonna end fast.
jim_halpert Why won't more people do that?
pam_beesly Cause they're just stupid.
jim_halpert What?
jim_halpert Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...
pam_beesly Yeah... That was um...
jim_halpert I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
pam_beesly Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...
jim_halpert Right!
pam_beesly ... We're dating.
jim_halpert Wow! There it is.
pam_beesly Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. Right?
jim_halpert It is going really great.
dwight_schrute Oww!
angela_martin Shut up.
dwight_schrute You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
angela_martin Oh, really?
dwight_schrute You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
angela_martin I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
michael_scott We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
pam_beesly Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
michael_scott Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
jim_halpert Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
pam_beesly Giant check it is.
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Yep.
dwight_schrute Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
jim_halpert Bat birth control
dwight_schrute Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
michael_scott You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
pam_beesly Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
jim_halpert Which we are.
pam_beesly And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
michael_scott What about a rabies nurse?
pam_beesly I don't think so.
jim_halpert You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
michael_scott That's possible. Look into that.
jim_halpert Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
dwight_schrute Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
michael_scott Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
pam_beesly Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles.
michael_scott Come in.
pam_beesly Hey.
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey
pam_beesly Oh my God.
michael_scott What are you doing?
pam_beesly You said come in!
michael_scott No I didn't, just please don't...
pam_beesly Oh my God.
pam_beesly So I closed the door but the image of his...
jim_halpert Baquette.
pam_beesly ... dangling participle...
jim_halpert Eww.
pam_beesly ... still burned in my eyes.
jim_halpert I can imagine.
pam_beesly Come in.
michael_scott May I enter the room?
pam_beesly Yes. Or come in.
michael_scott See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
jim_halpert You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
michael_scott Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
pam_beesly On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
michael_scott European offices are naked all the time.
pam_beesly They're so not.
michael_scott Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
pam_beesly I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
jim_halpert Gross.
michael_scott That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
jim_halpert Alright.
pam_beesly They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.
jim_halpert Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
jan_levinson OK, name please.
creed_bratton Creed Bratton, 75 plus division.
jan_levinson You're over 75 years old?
creed_bratton 82 November first. How much is the prize money?
jan_levinson There's no prize money.
creed_bratton What, is any of this real?
michael_scott Check that out. Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?
jan_levinson So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
pam_beesly What? Look, no it was not...
jan_levinson I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
michael_scott OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
darryl_philbin I'm giving him a peanut.
michael_scott No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
darryl_philbin Look how happy he is.
michael_scott He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? This is the reason we're here.
elizabeth_the_stripper Hello Michael.
michael_scott Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
elizabeth_the_stripper Yeah.
michael_scott Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
elizabeth_the_stripper Great.
michael_scott You got it?
dwight_schrute Mm-hmm.
michael_scott OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
michael_scott Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
dwight_schrute On your marks, get set...
michael_scott Beow!
toby_flenderson Hey!
michael_scott On your left!
oscar_martinez You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
creed_bratton That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
michael_scott I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.
stanley_hudson Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
andy_bernard I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance.
pam_beesly Yeah. Oh we're in last place.
jim_halpert Oh, would you look at that.
pam_beesly Darn it.
jan_levinson Water? Water? Water babe?
michael_scott No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
jan_levinson Michael that's irrational.
michael_scott Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
andy_bernard Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.
creed_bratton Can we get another round?
Waitress#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode01 OK.
creed_bratton Thanks.
stanley_hudson So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
oscar_martinez More or less.
stanley_hudson Hmmm...
michael_scott That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
dwight_schrute You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
michael_scott Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
toby_flenderson I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
jim_halpert Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
pam_beesly I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
jim_halpert OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
pam_beesly Mmm... Yes.
jim_halpert That's what I thought.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Right. Let's do some good.
ryan_howard for the cure... leave a message" Ryan hangs up]
michael_scott Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch.
andy_bernard Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
kevin_malone Back off me.
dwight_schrute How ya feeling, better?
angela_martin No.
dwight_schrute Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
angela_martin The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
dwight_schrute I am a farmer Angela.
angela_martin What does that mean?
dwight_schrute OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
angela_martin You did kill her!?
dwight_schrute I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
angela_martin You put her in my freezer.
dwight_schrute It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
angela_martin Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
dwight_schrute Well I'm not responsible for that!
angela_martin You!
dwight_schrute Hey, Oww! It's OK.
angela_martin It's OK.
dwight_schrute It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
angela_martin It's nothing.
dwight_schrute It's fine. What?
angela_martin How could you do that without telling me?
dwight_schrute I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
angela_martin Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
dwight_schrute I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
angela_martin You don't understand.
michael_scott Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
dwight_schrute Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
angela_martin Don't touch me Dwight!
pam_beesly You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.
jim_halpert Oh, and I get to carry it.
toby_flenderson And the winner is Toby Flenderson.
kelly_kapoor Have a seat, I'll write it down.
toby_flenderson Where are we?
kelly_kapoor I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
toby_flenderson He couldn't have made it a circle?
michael_scott I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.
jim_halpert ...talk about it.
pam_beesly Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
jim_halpert What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
michael_scott I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
jim_halpert Well, you're probably dehydrated.
michael_scott What do you want me to do Jim?
jim_halpert Glass of water would be a start.
michael_scott No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
jim_halpert Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
pam_beesly I'm still having a nice day.
jim_halpert You are?
pam_beesly Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.
michael_scott That's a good deal.
pam_beesly And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.
michael_scott Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
pam_beesly Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
michael_scott You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
pam_beesly I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
michael_scott You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my pen1s. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k No, no!
michael_scott Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.
meredith_palmer Hey Michael.
michael_scott Hey Mer. How ya doing?
meredith_palmer Better.
michael_scott It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
meredith_palmer I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
michael_scott Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. Wanna share?
meredith_palmer Sure.
michael_scott I'm not really sick. Nah, I'm good.
