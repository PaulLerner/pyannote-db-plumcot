oscar_martinez Not again.
dwight_schrute Bow down before Recyclops.
jim_halpert Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.
dwight_schrute Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
jim_halpert The next year he really stepped things up.
dwight_schrute Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
jim_halpert A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.
dwight_schrute Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
jim_halpert Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.
dwight_schrute Recyclops will have his revenge.
jim_halpert I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.
pam_beesly Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.
dwight_schrute Recyclops destroys!
stanley_hudson Oh, is today Recyclops Day?
dwight_schrute Yes.
stanley_hudson I thought you were killed by Polluticorn.
dwight_schrute Polluticorn wishes.
andy_bernard That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.
dwight_schrute Humans are terrible for the environment.
pam_beesly The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.
jim_halpert Mmm.
pam_beesly A world where you truly can be anything you want.
jim_halpert God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.
michael_scott Ok. Ok. How 'bout this?
pam_beesly That's great.
michael_scott I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.
pam_beesly Sure.
michael_scott Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.
meredith_palmer And it looks like you're taking a dump.
michael_scott Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.
andy_bernard Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott.
pam_beesly Don't do the twirl.
phyllis_vance Lose the twirl.
dwight_schrute The twirl sucks.
kevin_malone Michael, I hated the twirl.
andy_bernard Hate the twirl!
michael_scott Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
phyllis_vance Yeah, good. Don't do it.
michael_scott I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.
oscar_martinez The long term problem is bad investments that they need to dump. The short term problem is the company has no cash and there's no where to get it.
michael_scott Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
oscar_martinez Those are the bullet points.
michael_scott Well, could you condense it please?
oscar_martinez That's as simple as I can make it.
erin_hannon Michael? The limo's here for you.
michael_scott It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
erin_hannon He said limousine, so...
kevin_malone Check it out, guys. There's a limo down here. Michael, look. Oh, man.
michael_scott They sent a limo.
michael_scott Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.
michael_scott Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
dwight_schrute What kind of mileage does this baby get?
erin_hannon It's like what high school kids take to prom on tv shows.
oscar_martinez This is so typical of management to spend money on this. Ugh. Bunch of boobs.
michael_scott Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
dwight_schrute Calves. Calves all the way.
andy_bernard I'm so jealous right now.
michael_scott Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
Limo#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 Driver Car seats eight.
michael_scott What?
Limo#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 Driver The car seats eight.
michael_scott The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
jim_halpert & Pam No thanks.
ryan_howard I'll use it when you're done.
michael_scott Mmm... whoa.
oscar_martinez The Dunder Mifflin stock symbol is DMI. Do you know what that stands for? Dummies, morons and idiots. Because that's what you'd have to be to own it. And, as one of those idiots, I believe the board owes me answers.
michael_scott I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.
andy_bernard Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had s*x in here?
michael_scott Definitely.
dwight_schrute Smells like it.
michael_scott Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
dwight_schrute Word.
andy_bernard Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
michael_scott Who's playing with the button?
jim_halpert Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?
ryan_howard Uh, it doesn't seem like there's much of a point if the company's going under.
jim_halpert But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
ryan_howard The company's probably going under, though.
jim_halpert Could go either way.
ryan_howard Seems like it's leaning one way.
jim_halpert Maybe we should just wait and find out.
ryan_howard Definitely.
jim_halpert Ok.
ryan_howard So should we wait to find out before we start doing all this stuff?
jim_halpert Nah. Might as well do it now.
andy_bernard Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?
michael_scott I will have to answer.
dwight_schrute I'll ask you a question.
andy_bernard Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
dwight_schrute Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
michael_scott No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' I won't say that. I'll something like that.
andy_bernard This is your big day. Come on.
michael_scott Oh, my god. This is it.
laurie Mr. Scott?
michael_scott Yes.
laurie I'm Laurie.
michael_scott Oh, hi.
laurie Thank you for joining us. Come with me.
michael_scott Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
laurie Ok. If you just want to follow me I'll take you up to the lounge.
michael_scott Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
andy_bernard Kay.
dwight_schrute Good luck, Michael.
michael_scott See you later.
michael_scott Officers. Thank you.
laurie After you, Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Thank you.
david_wallace Michael.
michael_scott Hello.
david_wallace So glad you could make it.
michael_scott Thank you.
david_wallace How was the ride?
michael_scott Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
david_wallace I'm glad. I want to introduce you to everyone. First we'll start with Alan Brand. Alan? CEO. Michael Scott, Branch manager, Scranton.
alan_brand It's nice to meet you, Michael.
michael_scott It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.
david_wallace Seated, we have the former congressman, Chris O'Keefe.
michael_scott Ah. Your eminence.
Registrar#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles.
dwight_schrute Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Ah. Damn it. Wha- okay
dwight_schrute I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
oscar_martinez Can you believe this? The money they spent on this convention hall. Excuse me, miss. I just want to take the stupid board of directors by their necks. This is so simple.
andy_bernard Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.
oscar_martinez Oh, what a great idea and lose my job. No thank you.
andy_bernard Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?
dwight_schrute How is he gonna have grandkids?
michael_scott You guys ever protect the president?
Security#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 No.
michael_scott What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
Security#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 Not supposed to talk about it. Nelly Furtado.
alan_brand Alright, guys. You ready?
michael_scott Rock and roll.
alan_brand Dunder Mifflin is still a strong company. We are poised to come through this more streamlined and profitable than ever.
michael_scott This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
david_wallace It was fun when we weren't on the brink of bankruptcy.
michael_scott We're going bankrupt, you think? They are really angry.
alan_brand The shareholders need to empower our leadership -
albany_employee in line I'm just gonna run to the bathroom. Will you save my place?
angela_martin in line Sure.
dwight_schrute No. You will not.
albany_employee in line Excuse me?
dwight_schrute Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
albany_employee in line It'll just be a second.
dwight_schrute Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
alan_brand ... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager.
dwight_schrute Yes.
alan_brand In these uncertain times, Michael has managed to maintain steady profits from his Scranton branch. We all thank you, Michael. Another bright spot in the Dunder Mifflin landscape, our new waste pulp re-purposing plant in Milford.
jim_halpert Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?
phyllis_vance Bob took me to Capello's. We got a little tipsy.
jim_halpert Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
phyllis_vance Oh, it's ok. Michael doesn't really care about these things.
jim_halpert I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
stanley_hudson That doesn't make you a boss.
phyllis_vance It's not like you can fire people or anything.
jim_halpert Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
phyllis_vance Ryan.
stanley_hudson Can't say.
phyllis_vance Sorry. Plastered.
jim_halpert Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?
pam_beesly Stuff gets around. I don't participate.
jim_halpert Who here heard it from Ryan?
kevin_malone Does and email count?
jim_halpert Yes.
kevin_malone Yeah.
jim_halpert I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright? Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?
pam_beesly I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.
oscar_martinez These questions are bush league.
andy_bernard You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. Don't be a wuss.
andy_bernard I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .
david_wallace Believe me everyone is working very hard, working weekends, struggling, trying to right the ship.
Shareholder#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 You're a criminal.
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 Shareholder Limousine?
michael_scott Yes.
kelly_kapoor Shareholder You're all corrupt. You should be in jail.
alan_brand Quiet! Quiet, please! Please, quiet! Quiet, please. We want to hear your questions.
ryan_howard Do you love her or do you love the idea of her?
creed_bratton I don't know, man. I just don't know.
jim_halpert I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?
pam_beesly Can you actually fire people?
jim_halpert To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.
pam_beesly Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.
jim_halpert Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
pam_beesly Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.
jim_halpert Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.
pam_beesly Well, you'll figure it out.
alan_brand Ok. We're gonna take a 15 minute break and then we're gonna answer more questions.
Third#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 Shareholder You haven't said anything yet and we're headed for bankruptcy.
michael_scott Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -
Fourth#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode11 Shareholder How are you gonna fix the company?
michael_scott Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. And you can take that to the bank. And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. I love you, New York! You. You.
jim_halpert Hey, Ryan. How's it going?
ryan_howard Here's the thing. Um, I've tried it like five different ways in my head and - Oh, got one. Um, I'm such a perfectionist...
jim_halpert Mmm-hmm.
ryan_howard That I'd kinda rather not do it all then do a crappy version.
jim_halpert Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
ryan_howard Sounds like you have a really specific vision for it. Do you wanna maybe just take a whack at it?
jim_halpert You know what?
ryan_howard What?
jim_halpert I think I know the problem.
ryan_howard Great.
jim_halpert I think you seem distracted.
ryan_howard Yep, that is a problem.
jim_halpert But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
ryan_howard Well, I'm glad you're finally being proactive, Jim.
jim_halpert I am, too. Let me show you.
michael_scott Wow. Things are really picking up.
chris_okeefe What was that about?
michael_scott What?
alan_brand You were supposed to wave.
michael_scott I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
david_wallace What are we supposed to tell them now? Ok? You've dug us quite a hole.
michael_scott We tell them the plan, right?
david_wallace There is no plan.
michael_scott Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
chris_okeefe Excuse me?
michael_scott Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
chris_okeefe Who the hell is this guy?
michael_scott I am the guy who roused that crowd.
david_wallace Yes.
michael_scott Got them on their feet.
david_wallace Yes.
michael_scott They were so happy down there.
david_wallace Yes.
alan_brand Who cares?
michael_scott Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
david_wallace No. No. No. No. No. No. Don't call anybody, Michael.
michael_scott Well, I'm texting him, so.
david_wallace Please do not text anybody, now, Michael.
michael_scott It's done.
michael_scott Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away.
jim_halpert I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.
ryan_howard Mmm-hmm.
jim_halpert Let me show you what I mean. Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.
ryan_howard I will, uh, I will do my work right now. I will stay late tonight.
jim_halpert Right.
ryan_howard Uh, I'm very sorry... about everything.
jim_halpert You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it.
ryan_howard Is there internet?
oscar_martinez Ummm...
michael_scott Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
oscar_martinez Ok
michael_scott Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
oscar_martinez Um..
michael_scott It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
oscar_martinez I feel, as does Mr. Scott, that we are in the best of hands. Capable hands.
michael_scott That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
oscar_martinez I think this has gone very well and I thank you.
michael_scott O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. What are you doing?
oscar_martinez Michael, I didn't ask to come up here.
michael_scott Wow, man. That -
oscar_martinez What?
michael_scott That was embarrassing.
oscar_martinez For me.
michael_scott For me, too. You embarrassed me.
oscar_martinez You -
michael_scott Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
chris_okeefe He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron?
michael_scott Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.
michael_scott
michael_scott Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.' That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks. Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.
chris_okeefe He can take the bus. He's had his limo ride.
michael_scott Oscar! Oscar! Come on! There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!
alan_brand The gentleman in the, uh, glasses.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
alan_brand Thank you. Thank you for your suggestions.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
