jim The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
andy That's the other thing you got to watch out. Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, michael Scott.
jim Yeah.
andy So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
jim You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
andy Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
jim Sounds good Andy.
karen This is going to be an adventure.
jim Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
karen Right on. Hey is that Josh's computer?
andy What?
pam Hey!
toby Hey.
pam How'd the run go?
toby Ah, pretty good. I finished.
pam That's great!
dwight Psh, why is that great?
pam Because he accomplished something.
dwight What was your mile time?
toby About seven.
dwight I could beat that on a skateboard.
toby Well, that has wheels.
dwight Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
pam Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
dwight Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
pam Really?
dwight I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
dwight Man, what is taking toby so long?
pam Oh, I'll just time him later.
dwight And you'll compare the times?
pam Yeah. Are you ready?
dwight No, my groin.
pam Set
dwight . is really tight.
pam Go!
dwight I can't.
pam Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
dwight Aaaaah!
pam I should probably get back to work.
michael Here. Who's here?
dwight Nametag?
michael Yes, please.
dwight karen Filippelli.
michael karen Filip. Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
dwight Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
michael Okay.
michael My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus.
michael Who's next?
dwight That's andy Bernard.
michael andy Bernard.
dwight If I were you.
michael Saint Bernard.
dwight . I would fire Anthony Gardner.
michael What?
dwight . before noon.
michael I'm not.
dwight . to consolidate power.
michael I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
dwight No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
dwight The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
pam Good morning!
michael Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do. set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
pam Okay.
pam Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy. to have an old friend back.
hannah Hello?
michael Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is hannah Smoterich-Barr.

karen Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
michael Mmm. dah. I am actually your boss, michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G. I. or uh?
andy I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
andy Hello.
michael Ah! You must be andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
andy And you must be michael Scott. Aloha and. hello.
michael A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.

michael You know who I really like? Is this guy andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
martin . which is why they need a passing game.
jim Right.
michael No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
jim Okay.
michael How are you? martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
martin Oh! Thanks.
michael Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. Not. so, your desk is.
jim Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
pam Oh my god! It's really you!
jim Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met.
pam I know. I don't care.
jim Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
pam It's really good to see you.
jim You, too.
jim Where do I stand with Pam? Um. no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um. . that is where we stand.
dwight Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
jim Hey, Dwight.
dwight Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
jim Okay. Sounds good.
dwight What are you doing?
jim I don't know what you're talking about.
dwight I have a smudge on my forehead?
jim No. Looks good.
dwight Why are you looking at my forehead?
jim I'm not.
dwight Meet my eye line, Jim!
jim I am.
dwight Stop acting like an idiot!
jim Okay.
ryan Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
jim Hey! How are you man? Good to see. you.
ryan I'm good! How are you? So.
jim Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
ryan Yeah.

ryan Cool, thank you.
jim Let me get that for you.
ryan Yuh.
jim This one taken? No. Good.
ryan Yeah. jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
toby Hey, this came with the Stamford book. Can you take care of it?
kevin Oh, yes I can.
kevin In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
andy michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
michael Right.
dwight Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
andy andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
dwight So you'll be reporting to me, then.
andy Umm, on the contrary.
dwight My title has 'Manager' in it.
andy And I'm a director.
dwight Oh.
andy Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
dwight I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
andy Congratulations.
jim Hey, Toby!
toby Hey, Jim!
jim How are you, man?
toby Oh, really good.
jim I just wanted to say hi.
toby How are you? Hey. Welcome back.
jim Oh. Is that like your new thing?
toby No, I'm sorry, it's.
jim No. It's cool.
toby No, it's nothing. We'll just.
jim All right. Good to be back.
toby So. okay.
jim All right.
toby All right. sorry. sorry about that.
jim No problem.
toby It was just.
jim . what?
toby Nothing.
kevin This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred. a credit card. It will shred. oh! Shoot.
michael I present the orientation video.
dwight We need to talk!
michael Not now.
dwight Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
michael I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
dwight Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
michael It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
dwight Ok. Who reports to who?
michael I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
dwight And then if I want.
michael Work it out amongst your selves!
dwight I.
michael Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
dwight I.
michael Will you?
dwight One.
michael Please?
kelly Jim!
jim Kelly!
kelly Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
jim Really?
kelly Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
jim Great. What's new with you?
kelly I just told you.
michael Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For. drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
michael Yoko shack. Male
voice . thank you James.
meredith Hey, champagne.
michael Nope, no. Guests only.
kelly Looks like salmon.
michael Nope. Um. for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
kelly I eat beef.
michael Well, then. consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
kevin The beef is poisoned?
michael No, it's not beef. just. sit down, please. Welcome. Help yourself.
toby Um. You might want these orientation materials.
michael Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
jim Oh, this looks promising.
pam You won't be disappointed.
michael Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
video 
michael Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man dwight just to see what was shakin'.
dwight Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
michael So check out how we live michael &amp;
dwight in the Electric City!
michael They call it Scranton.
dwight What?
michael The Electric City. Scranton.
dwight What?
michael The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
dwight But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
jim It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
michael I am so scared. when people don't label their personal food.
video 
michael You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
dwight But the little cars go in the compact spot michael and
dwight Spot, spot, spot, spot . . push;
michael Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
michael Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.
karen This is karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
jim Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
karen This is karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
jim Not bad, but you are Italian so. try it more Italian.
karen Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
jim You feel good?
karen Mm-hm.
jim All right.
karen karen Filippelli.
andy Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
dwight Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
andy Sure thing, buddy.
andy Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
andy Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
angela Oh.
andy Do you like it?
angela I do like it, actually.
andy Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
angela Thank you.
andy You're welcome.
pam Hey.
jim Hey!
pam What happened to grape soda?
jim Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
pam Oh. You've changed so much.
jim Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
pam So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or. you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
jim Oh! Um. tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
pam Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
jim Okay.
michael Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I.
jim Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm.
michael All right.
jim Don't.
michael Okay.
jim All right. I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
pam Yeah. I know, me too.
jim All right!
pam The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
hannah Take a picture. It'll last longer.
ryan I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
creed Ditto that, my brother.
hannah Look what's on his computer.
michael What is that? A squid's eye or.
hannah It's my left breast.
michael How did you.
creed Right place at the right time.
karen Uh, what's that smell?
phyllis What smell?
karen Must be an. air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
phyllis Oh, I'll help you find it.
karen Oh, you know. Never. . never mind.
phyllis What is it?
karen I. I. I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
phyllis My perfume?
karen It's just my crazy nose. I'm. uh, used to different smells.
phyllis Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
karen Who's Bob Vance?
phyllis You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
stanley I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
michael People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
michael I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work. ' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night. at. the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's. I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
dwight Do you have batteries?
michael Ssshh stupid! Um.
andy 
michael That's it!
andy What is love?
michael Yes, yes! Okay!
andy Baby, don't hurt me.
michael Okay, here we go. andy &amp;
michael Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!
michael Oh!
andy Baby, don't hurt me!
michael Oh! Oh! Oh!
andy Whoa-oh-oh-oh
michael Scuse me! Scuse me! andy &amp;
michael Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh.
michael You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
andy Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
michael You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
andy Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
michael Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
dwight Very funny, Michael!
michael Okay! Okay!
dwight Really funny, Michael!
michael All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
michael Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
karen Shouldn't we be equals?
michael Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
tony Uh. this is difficult, for me.
michael I understand. We're all friends.
tony No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.
michael Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
tony 
michael You know what? I'll help. I will.
tony No, please. No.
michael Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
dwight Do this. Come on. Ready?
michael Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
dwight On three. One. two. three.
michael Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this. I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
tony All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
michael We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
tony Let me go!
michael I'm right in your crack!
tony Put me down right.
michael Up and over.
tony Put me down!
michael Up and over.
tony Put me down right now!
michael You've got it.
tony I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
michael You've got it, you've got it.
tony PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!
michael Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
dwight Hey, hey. Easy.
michael Easy.
tony I'm sorry!
michael Don't.
tony It's just not going to work for me.
michael What.
tony I have to go.
michael I don't understand.
tony I was on the fence about this and. it's just not a good fit.
michael Well, we'll squeeze you in.
tony I can't work here. I have to quit.
michael You can't quit! On the first day. That's heresy, my friend! Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what. Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's. what?
tony No. toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.
michael My management style? So. didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
tony No. Was it supposed to be funny?
michael Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
tony Excuse me?
michael You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
tony But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.
michael Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
dwight That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
michael Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
dwight And what advice has andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
andy dwight may have won the battle. But I will win. the next battle.
hannah tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
angela Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
michael Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
stanley Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
michael No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
michael The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
michael Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
dwight What!
michael Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
karen Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
jim Does he ever.
michael Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
dwight YEAH!
michael Yeah.
toby I don't. I don't think we can do that.
michael Go home, Toby. Just.
martin Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?
michael Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
hannah For crying out loud.
michael No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh.
martin What's up with this guy?
stanley Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
michael THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
stanley Trust me. It only gets worse.
martin Is he always like this?
ryan Sometimes he brings more costumes.
hannah When do people work?
phyllis Oh, we find little times during the day.
karen How are we going to get home?
phyllis Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
karen Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
michael See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. Jell-o!
jan Michael!
michael Hi, Jan!
jan Did you fire tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
michael I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
jan Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
michael Yes.
jan You do?
michael But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
jan What? No. No. No, jim is your Number Two.
michael What?
jan He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
michael Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
michael So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make jim my new Number Two.
dwight If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
jim Yeah, it does, actually.
dwight So who will be your new Number Three?
michael Uh. that I have not decided yet.
andy Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
michael Thank you, Andy. That's. very kind. Thanks.
dwight And I have to say your leadership.
michael Shut it.
dwight has brought.
michael Shut it! That's. suck up!
jim Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
karen I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
jim What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
karen Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
jim Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I. . Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
karen Yeah.
jim Ok, thanks.
karen Ok.
jim Hey.
pam Hey!
jim I thought you had already. left.
pam Uh. no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
jim Oh. Good.
pam What's up?
jim Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today. or something.
pam What do you mean?
jim I just think I should tell you that. I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh.
pam Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
jim O. ok. Um. good.
pam We're friends. We'll always be friends.
jim Right.
pam It's good to have you back.
jim Yeah. Good to be back.
meredith Where'd you get that salad?
kevin Staples.
andy Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
dwight Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
andy Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
dwight Xterra's not even a real word.
andy Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth. "
dwight Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
andy Yeah.
dwight That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
andy Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
dwight Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
andy Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
dwight Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
andy Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
dwight Idiot!
andy If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
dwight If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
andy Idiot!
dwight You're the idiot!
andy Nice comeback!
dwight I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. Totally got the best of that interchange.
