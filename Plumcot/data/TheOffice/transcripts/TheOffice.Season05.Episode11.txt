pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
michael_scott Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
pam_beesly Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
dwight_schrute Aah!
phyllis_vance Wow, thirteen!
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott No. No, no. There was wind.
dwight_schrute I was just jogging.
michael_scott Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
jim_halpert No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
michael_scott I want another try. Here we go! Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
stanley_hudson There was a car.
michael_scott I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
oscar_martinez Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
michael_scott Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
oscar_martinez That's impossible.
michael_scott Beat it!
michael_scott Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
pam_beesly Quick announcement new year, new candy.
kevin_malone Whoo-hoo!
pam_beesly Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
kevin_malone Hot tamales.
pam_beesly Yeah.
kevin_malone Uh oh.
pam_beesly So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
andy_bernard Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
michael_scott Wait, you still don't know...
jim_halpert No, no. Nope.
andy_bernard Hmm?
jim_halpert Nothing.
michael_scott You still don't know.
jim_halpert Why don't... Let's...
michael_scott What are you doing?
jim_halpert How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
michael_scott Andy.
jim_halpert Ahh!
andy_bernard No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
michael_scott No, what I'm saying is...
jim_halpert No, no.
michael_scott No, that's not it.
jim_halpert I know.
jim_halpert Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
michael_scott How can he still not know?
jim_halpert We can't figure that out.
michael_scott I can't take it anymore.
dwight_schrute Wait, what? You can't take what?
michael_scott I am telling Andy.
dwight_schrute No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
michael_scott Who should it come from, then?
all@ Angela.
michael_scott Are you still having intercourse with her?
oscar_martinez What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
michael_scott Did you ever have intercourse in this office?
oscar_martinez Are you serious? Ugh. Where? Where? Where, Dwight?
dwight_schrute Seems like you already know where.
angela_martin Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
kevin_malone Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
angela_martin That's enough.
kevin_malone Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form... What?
oscar_martinez That was good... It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
kevin_malone How about, "I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?"
oscar_martinez There you go.
andy_bernard That cannot be true! You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...
dwight_schrute Trade seats with me.
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
jim_halpert Please stop.
dwight_schrute I need a soup spoon.
dwight_schrute Rule 17 don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep.
dwight_schrute
angela_martin What is it?
dwight_schrute You've got to tell Andy about us.
angela_martin That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
dwight_schrute Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
angela_martin You're expanding on your worst idea.
dwight_schrute Do you love me or not?
angela_martin I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
dwight_schrute Because you're engaged to Andy.
angela_martin
michael_scott Well?
dwight_schrute Not yet.
jim_halpert When?
andy_bernard When what? When what?
michael_scott You know this can't go on.
andy_bernard What can't go on?
michael_scott We have to put an end to this.
andy_bernard Seems like...
michael_scott Come on.
andy_bernard You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.
jim_halpert This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
dwight_schrute Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
michael_scott When will she be ready?
dwight_schrute I don't know.
michael_scott Is she crazy in bed?
dwight_schrute Yes.
jim_halpert Stop. What?
michael_scott How so, specifically?
jim_halpert Okay, listen.
dwight_schrute Eager.
jim_halpert This shouldn't happen at work.
dwight_schrute And flexible.
jim_halpert And!
michael_scott Really?
jim_halpert This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
michael_scott It's too late.
jim_halpert Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
michael_scott I am already walking.
dwight_schrute Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
michael_scott Okay, what does that mean?
dwight_schrute Might get ugly.
michael_scott Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
jim_halpert But you're leaving...
dwight_schrute Have a good trip.
michael_scott Thanks. Andy?
andy_bernard Yeah.
michael_scott Walk with me.
andy_bernard Will do, boss-man.
michael_scott Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...
andy_bernard You're not making any sense.
michael_scott Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
andy_bernard All righty.
michael_scott Which will be fine. I am off!
andy_bernard Have a good meeting!
michael_scott Thank you!
andy_bernard Kick Wallace's ass!
michael_scott Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
andy_bernard I can't hear you through the glass
michael_scott Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
andy_bernard What?
michael_scott All right. See you later. Ahh.
andy_bernard Are you serious?
michael_scott Yep.
meredith_palmer I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
oscar_martinez You said that yesterday.
meredith_palmer Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.
jim_halpert What are you standing for?
dwight_schrute If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
jim_halpert You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
dwight_schrute If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
jim_halpert Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
andy_bernard I need to talk to you.
angela_martin We can talk right here.
andy_bernard I need to talk to you in private.
kevin_malone We're not listening.
andy_bernard Let's go to the conference room.
andy_bernard Is it true?
angela_martin What have you heard?
andy_bernard That you're sleeping with Dwight.
angela_martin That doesn't sound like me.
andy_bernard Is it true?
angela_martin Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake...
andy_bernard Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
angela_martin A little bit.
andy_bernard How long has it been going on?
angela_martin I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and... I don't know exactly when we started up again.
andy_bernard Who else knows about it?
angela_martin Michael.
andy_bernard Who else?
angela_martin Let me think about it... I, um... there...
andy_bernard Oh God. Come on!
david_wallace So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but... what are you doing right?
michael_scott Right what?
david_wallace Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing... is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
michael_scott David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
michael_scott Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
michael_scott This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.
david_wallace Here's the thing. Michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
michael_scott Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
david_wallace What say we do.
angela_martin Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
andy_bernard So like, missionary...
angela_martin I said nothing fancy.
andy_bernard Do you love him?
angela_martin I love you.
andy_bernard Why should I believe that?
angela_martin Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
andy_bernard Who says that?
angela_martin Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
andy_bernard Where's Dwight?
jim_halpert You okay, man?
andy_bernard No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.
creed_bratton You are welcome.
andy_bernard Dwight.
dwight_schrute Andy.
andy_bernard It's over.
dwight_schrute Oh good. She broke up with you.
andy_bernard No. It's over between you two.
dwight_schrute Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
andy_bernard You have to.
dwight_schrute No I don't.
andy_bernard She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
dwight_schrute Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
andy_bernard Angela Bernard.
dwight_schrute Will never be her name.
andy_bernard It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
dwight_schrute I don't think so.
jim_halpert Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
andy_bernard I'm telling you to back down.
dwight_schrute And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
andy_bernard Then I'll make you.
dwight_schrute Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
andy_bernard Through the use of force.
dwight_schrute That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
andy_bernard I will fight you.
jim_halpert Nope.
dwight_schrute Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
andy_bernard Fine!
dwight_schrute Fine!
oscar_martinez This is nuts.
dwight_schrute What is your weapon?
jim_halpert Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
dwight_schrute Hey, this is none of your business.
jim_halpert Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
andy_bernard Guess what? Not happening at work.
dwight_schrute Yes!
andy_bernard We're gonna do it outside.
dwight_schrute Outside of work.
andy_bernard None of your business.
dwight_schrute None of your business then. Good. So what weapon?
andy_bernard My bare hands.
dwight_schrute That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
andy_bernard Then I'll get something too.
meredith_palmer I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
pam_beesly Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
angela_martin I will respect the results of the duel.
pam_beesly Of course you will.
meredith_palmer I call loser!
andy_bernard I will be taking my break at 4 00 in the parking lot.
dwight_schrute I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
andy_bernard What a coincidence.
dwight_schrute Mm.
jim_halpert So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute How'd that get there?
meredith_palmer There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
jim_halpert Thanks Meredith.
michael_scott So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket." And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need!... The need for tweed."
david_wallace It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. And thanks for coming in.
michael_scott Oh, thank you.
david_wallace Yes.
michael_scott I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
david_wallace Yeah.
michael_scott Okay.
david_wallace Yeah, finish up.
dwight_schrute Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
angela_martin I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
kelly_kapoor I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
dwight_schrute Come on!
meredith_palmer Hey, has anything happened yet?
dwight_schrute Where are you?
oscar_martinez Mm-mm. It's 4 10, I don't think he's gonna show.
kevin_malone Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
dwight_schrute Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... "From the desk of Andrew Bernard." A note. Pathetic. "Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested." True. "The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly..."
kelly_kapoor There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
phyllis_vance Why isn't Dwight turning around?
oscar_martinez The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
creed_bratton Yeah.
dwight_schrute Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
pam_beesly Oh my God!
stanley_hudson What's happening?
phyllis_vance Andy's running over Dwight with his car.
dwight_schrute Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
andy_bernard Yeah.
all@ watching Oh!
dwight_schrute Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
andy_bernard You give up?
dwight_schrute Never! Get out and face me like a man!
andy_bernard I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
dwight_schrute You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! All you do is dress fancy and sing. "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
andy_bernard Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
dwight_schrute Last year, idiot!
jim_halpert Dwight! Are your legs broken?
dwight_schrute No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
jim_halpert Andy, are you all right?
andy_bernard Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!
dwight_schrute Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that!
andy_bernard What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
dwight_schrute I sa-
andy_bernard What? You stupid idiot! You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods...
dwight_schrute Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
andy_bernard I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
dwight_schrute What?
andy_bernard What!
dwight_schrute She's sleeping with you?
andy_bernard I'm her fiance.
dwight_schrute She said she was only sleeping with me.
andy_bernard Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.
dwight_schrute
andy_bernard Thank you.
michael_scott Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. Ahh!
dwight_schrute
