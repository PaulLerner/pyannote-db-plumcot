ryan_howard What?
jim_halpert Oh, nothing.
jim_halpert Pam's on vacation and she gets back tomorrow, so it'll be nice to see her. It'll be nice, and, uh, she set a date for the wedding with Roy. Uh... June. Summer. So, that'll be nice. And that's that.
ryan_howard What?
jim_halpert Oh, nothing.
ryan_howard Jim's been looking at me kind of a lot all week. I would be creeped out by it, but it's nothing compared to the way Michael looks at me.
michael_scott Spamster!
pam_beesly Um, Pam plus Spam plus...?
michael_scott Hamster.
pam_beesly Right.
michael_scott Welcome back! How was your vacation?
pam_beesly It was great.
michael_scott Yeah?
pam_beesly Mm-hm.
michael_scott Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink!
pam_beesly Roy and I just got back from the Poconos. I get ten vacation days a year, and I try to hold off taking them for as long as possible, and this year I got to the third week in January.
michael_scott I am Pam. Spicoli guy. Oh, God. Names, numbers. Okay. Whoa! God! Yuck, yuck. Yuck. Yuck!
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott Wow! What happened in there?
pam_beesly I don't know.
michael_scott There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that?
pam_beesly Oh... I don't know.
michael_scott Is it a bird?
pam_beesly No, I don't think it's a bird.
michael_scott Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
kevin_malone What's goin' on?
michael_scott Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
kevin_malone I don't think that's vomit.
michael_scott Check it out.
kevin_malone Me?
michael_scott Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.
kevin_malone Oh, that's ridiculous.
michael_scott What is it?
kevin_malone Michael.
michael_scott What is it? No, just tell me what it is.
kevin_malone Michael, I ... I ... I gotta get outta here. I can't hold my breath that long.
pam_beesly Open the door up!
kevin_malone It smelled terrible.
pam_beesly and others Phew. Oh! No, mm-mm.
michael_scott I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
toby_flenderson That's no burst pipe.
michael_scott How do you know that? What is it, then?
creed_bratton Hi guys. Somebody makin' soup?
michael_scott Here she comes. All cleaned? Great.
dwight_schrute It's still stinky.
michael_scott That is worse.
dwight_schrute She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation.
michael_scott I am a big Fear Factor fan. I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape. Um... I can't stand it , I can't stay in here another second. No!
jim_halpert Hey! Welcome back!
pam_beesly Thanks!
jim_halpert So, how was the resort? Did you ski a lot?
pam_beesly A little.
jim_halpert Good! What's goin' on here?
jim_halpert What? I did not do that. That sounds disgusting.
ryan_howard It wasn't me. Um... it wasn't me. It was not me.
jim_halpert Oh. Wow.
pam_beesly
michael_scott Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
jim_halpert That might be a little difficult with the one computer.
michael_scott Oh... It's ...
jim_halpert But there's definitely a desk open in the back.
michael_scott Yeah ...
jim_halpert ...which I guess I'll be taking.
michael_scott No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
jim_halpert No, no, no, seriously, I'll be in the back.
jim_halpert Hey, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor Are you moving back here?
jim_halpert Um, just for the day while Michael's at my desk.
kelly_kapoor Because Toby used to sit there, but he had to move over there because of an allergy.
jim_halpert Allergy to... the desk?
kelly_kapoor Weird.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen.
dwight_schrute Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
michael_scott Don't ape me.
dwight_schrute Okay.
michael_scott This is great.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott The pressures of my office are insane.
dwight_schrute Mm.
michael_scott I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here.
dwight_schrute No way!
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute And who had your office?
michael_scott Ed Truck. Ed Truck was the manager before me. Horrible. He hated fun. It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us. Stop having fun. Start pretending to do work." What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.
kelly_kapoor I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...
michael_scott You know who used to sit at that desk?
dwight_schrute That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
michael_scott Mm-mm. Todd Packer.
dwight_schrute No!
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute I thought he was out on the road.
michael_scott He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
dwight_schrute Ah.
michael_scott When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office . Packer and I once spent the whole day with our pants off, and when people noticed, we convinced them that they were crazy.
michael_scott I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
stanley_hudson Excuse me one second, please. What is it that you need right now that you can't wait until I'm off the phone with a customer?
michael_scott Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. Okay.
michael_scott Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired.
creed_bratton What did you hit me for?
michael_scott Charley horse!
creed_bratton What?
michael_scott Charley horse!
creed_bratton You shouldn't have hit me, Michael.
michael_scott Oh, okay. Gah.
michael_scott Once, as a joke, Packer banged every chick in the office. It was hysterical.
kelly_kapoor Beyonce, pink the color, Pink the person, hot dogs, basically anything that is awesome. Snow cones...
ryan_howard Hey Jim, Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair.
jim_halpert It's the lever on the side.
ryan_howard That's what I told him. Thanks.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, he is so cute! Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me?
jim_halpert No, I don't think I can...
kelly_kapoor Oh, please Jim? Please, please, Jim. Please, please, please? He's so cute. I like him so much. And I would do it, but I'm too shy. Please, Jim, please, please, please, please, Jim. Please, please, please...
michael_scott Dwight.
dwight_schrute Michael.
michael_scott Let's send up Accounting.
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead.
michael_scott Hey guys.
oscar_martinez Hey, Michael.
michael_scott Ahem. What's up?
oscar_martinez Hey, Dwight.
michael_scott and Dwight Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules!
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott Yeah! Oh ho ho
dwight_schrute Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
michael_scott No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.
dwight_schrute Okay.
michael_scott Watch out, Pam. You're next!
pam_beesly You're gonna throw my things on the ground?
michael_scott Maybe!
oscar_martinez What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it , it makes sense But it... it was still wrong.
michael_scott Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.
michael_scott You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.
dwight_schrute Hello, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
michael_scott Stop.
dwight_schrute Jethro Tull...
michael_scott Stop it. Stop. It. Don't. Don't.
dwight_schrute I need to make a sales call. Please?
michael_scott All right.
dwight_schrute Am I the 107th caller?
pam_beesly ...back so soon.
roy_anderson We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.
pam_beesly Yeah, right.
roy_anderson Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.
pam_beesly Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend.
kelly_kapoor But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it. 'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9 30.
pam_beesly Are you kidding?
roy_anderson No.
michael_scott Hi, guys.
angela_martin We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.
michael_scott I'm just walking around.
angela_martin Were you?
michael_scott Well, yeah.
oscar_martinez It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.
michael_scott Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ... ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
phyllis_vance You're gonna compete against us?
michael_scott Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
dwight_schrute It is so on!
michael_scott God, this is gonna be fun.
dwight_schrute Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
michael_scott So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you. Yes! Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that! Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale!
darryl_philbin What... What's that? Whatcha doing?
michael_scott Nothing.
roy_anderson I think he's dancing.
michael_scott No. Just ...
darryl_philbin That was definitely not dancing.
michael_scott You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just...
darryl_philbin Paper business.
michael_scott Yeah, paper business. Is this done?
roy_anderson Nope.
michael_scott Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
pam_beesly Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.
creed_bratton Who do you think did it?
oscar_martinez Are you kidding? I thought it was you.
creed_bratton Really? I thought you.
michael_scott This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.
michael_scott You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.
pam_beesly That doesn't seem fair.
michael_scott You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
dwight_schrute But you're the one who picked today.
michael_scott I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
stanley_hudson That's not what a hate crime is.
michael_scott Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done . Very well. Then you are all punished.
pam_beesly What's our punishment?
michael_scott You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly. No. NO!
jim_halpert Hey!
ryan_howard What's up?
jim_halpert Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward.
ryan_howard What?
jim_halpert What do you think of Kelly?
ryan_howard I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ... Umm... She's really cool.
jim_halpert Are you interested in her?
ryan_howard Yeah, totally.
jim_halpert Really?
ryan_howard Did she say something?
jim_halpert She said lots of things.
ryan_howard Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?
jim_halpert I have no idea.
ryan_howard Can you find out?
jim_halpert Yeah. Sure.
kelly_kapoor Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?
michael_scott Do you remember Ed Truck?
creed_bratton Sure. He hired me. How's he doing?
michael_scott How would I know?
creed_bratton I thought you might.
michael_scott My biggest fear is turning into him.
creed_bratton Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.
michael_scott I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?
michael_scott Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.
ed_truck Yeah. Should we go upstairs?
michael_scott Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.
ed_truck So, what's the problem with my pension?
michael_scott Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
ed_truck Well, what was done?
michael_scott I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
ed_truck Yeah, somebody once did that in my office.
michael_scott Really?
ed_truck Yeah.
michael_scott Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?
ed_truck You can't expect to be friends with everybody.
michael_scott Well... s-sure I can.
ed_truck No. They'll always think of you as a boss first.
michael_scott Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.
ed_truck I'm not sure that ever happens.
michael_scott Well, okay. Different management styles.
ed_truck Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?
michael_scott Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, "Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney."
jim_halpert Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
kelly_kapoor You just asked a girl out on the phone!
jim_halpert Yep.
michael_scott Yes.
todd_packer Packer Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.
michael_scott Who is this? How did you get this number?
todd_packer Your mom, you gay nerd!
michael_scott Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?
todd_packer Hey, did you get that package I left for you?
michael_scott Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it?
todd_packer It was pretty big.
michael_scott Really?
todd_packer Yeah.
michael_scott Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?
todd_packer Left it in the middle of your office.
michael_scott Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
roy_anderson You mean the thing?
todd_packer
michael_scott Are you kidding me? Oh!
todd_packer Special delivery!
michael_scott That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you.
todd_packer Sit on the throne, Michael.
michael_scott Oh. Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!
michael_scott It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun. We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.
Jim's#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode14 voicemail You have seven unheard messages.
pam_beesly Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back!
pam_beesly Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.
pam_beesly Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.
pam_beesly I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.
pam_beesly Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.
pam_beesly Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.
pam_beesly Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk.
