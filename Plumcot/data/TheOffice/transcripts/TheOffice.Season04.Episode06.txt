rolando Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call.
karen_filippelli Yeah.
rolando Karen? He's on line one.
karen_filippelli Thanks Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton?
karen_filippelli I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
karen_filippelli Look, All I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye.
karen_filippelli Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
michael_scott This is perfect.
dwight_schrute He looks like your twin.
michael_scott This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
dwight_schrute I will know.
michael_scott But, you will not tell anyone.
dwight_schrute I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.
michael_scott Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
stanley_hudson I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
michael_scott Just go out, and come back in.
stanley_hudson I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
michael_scott What?
michael_scott Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
all@
michael_scott No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
jim_halpert Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
michael_scott Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
stanley_hudson I think it's because of my sales record.
michael_scott That could not possibly be it.
michael_scott You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.
michael_scott How can I get you to stay?
stanley_hudson Money.
michael_scott Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.
stanley_hudson Money.
michael_scott Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-
stanley_hudson Money.
michael_scott Pssh, kay.
pam_beesly Oscar, did you bring it?
oscar_martinez To be Edwardian. His best work.
pam_beesly Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
oscar_martinez Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
pam_beesly Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive.
oscar_martinez Besides having s*x with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
jim_halpert So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
pam_beesly Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
jim_halpert Oscar?
pam_beesly Some people.
karen_filippelli Hello?
michael_scott Fillipellers, how's it hanging?
karen_filippelli Michael...
michael_scott To the left?
karen_filippelli Listen, I-
michael_scott To the right?
karen_filippelli I'm-
michael_scott Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
karen_filippelli You called me.
michael_scott Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
karen_filippelli I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
michael_scott No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.
karen_filippelli Toby's not a salesperson.
michael_scott You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
karen_filippelli Oooh. Good-bye Michael.
michael_scott Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one?
pam_beesly I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
michael_scott Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
meredith_palmer Hi Michael.
michael_scott I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
meredith_palmer Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?
pam_beesly
michael_scott Get out. Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
meredith_palmer Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?
michael_scott No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
meredith_palmer Seriously?
michael_scott What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House.
dwight_schrute Found him!
michael_scott Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
jim_halpert So what are you going to do?
michael_scott What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.
jim_halpert Did they?
michael_scott Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
pam_beesly It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
michael_scott That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words.
jim_halpert We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
michael_scott What? What? We did?
dwight_schrute and Michael Surprise! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
michael_scott Look at his face! Look at his face!
jim_halpert What are we doing?
dwight_schrute Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
michael_scott What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
dwight_schrute Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
michael_scott We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
jim_halpert We're going to Utica?
michael_scott Uh-huh.
jim_halpert I'm not going to Utica right now.
michael_scott Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim.
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
michael_scott and Dwight Utica! Utica! Utica!
michael_scott and Dwight Utica! Utica!
michael_scott In your face
dwight_schrute Yow!
jim_halpert I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
michael_scott Are you calling Karen?
jim_halpert No, I'm not calling Karen.
dwight_schrute He's lying.
michael_scott Yep, get it.
jim_halpert What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Gah-ah-hah-ha!
jim_halpert Are you kidding me?
dwight_schrute No communication with the outside world Jim.
michael_scott It had to be done, it had to be done.
jim_halpert Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
dwight_schrute Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Hey Dwight, he found it.
jim_halpert You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.
michael_scott Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
jim_halpert Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?
michael_scott Do you really wanna know?
jim_halpert Oh, God.
michael_scott Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
dwight_schrute Or real bombs.
michael_scott No, no, not real bombs.
dwight_schrute Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
michael_scott Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott It could be badass. Yeah, it will.
jim_halpert No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
dwight_schrute Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
jim_halpert Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
michael_scott Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
jim_halpert So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache.
michael_scott So, why did you and Karen break up? Was it the s*x?
jim_halpert What?
michael_scott I can't imagine the s*x being bad, I mean her body is...
jim_halpert Okay, you know what?
michael_scott ...awesome.
jim_halpert Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
michael_scott Okay, I will start. Um, "A." "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um...
jim_halpert It doesn't matter.
michael_scott I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
jim_halpert Doesn't matter.
michael_scott Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something?
jim_halpert That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
michael_scott What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?
dwight_schrute I'm peeing in this empty can.
jim_halpert Oh my God!
michael_scott Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
dwight_schrute Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
jim_halpert Michael, watch the road!
dwight_schrute Hey, you're making me spray!
michael_scott I'll kill you man!
jim_halpert Michael! Michael, pull over!
michael_scott That is just so disgusting!
jim_halpert Pull over, pull over!
dwight_schrute I think I cut my pen1s on the lid!
oscar_martinez Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
toby_flenderson I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
pam_beesly And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
andy_bernard Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
oscar_martinez What are you doing?
andy_bernard Just came to discuss my favorite E.M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
pam_beesly Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
andy_bernard The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
andy_bernard Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
toby_flenderson Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
andy_bernard Why can't I be in the club?
jim_halpert I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
dwight_schrute Believe it.
michael_scott Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
jim_halpert No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car.
michael_scott Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-
jim_halpert Guy's going by. Shh.
michael_scott You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
dwight_schrute And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
jim_halpert No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
dwight_schrute Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
jim_halpert Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
dwight_schrute Okay, Jim.
jim_halpert Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
dwight_schrute Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
jim_halpert Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
pam_beesly I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention.
kevin_malone Damn it!
pam_beesly It just- To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh...
oscar_martinez Yes.
kevin_malone Damn it!
pam_beesly Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
oscar_martinez Very brave.
pam_beesly Very brave choice also, I thought.
oscar_martinez And George, his- his youthfulness. His, um, freedom. Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um... What are you microwaving!?
phyllis_vance Popcorn.
pam_beesly Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
phyllis_vance Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn.
andy_bernard So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
stanley_hudson Yep, looks that way.
andy_bernard I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch.
michael_scott We are in a stairwell.
dwight_schrute We are climbing some stairs.
dwight_schrute I'm breathing heavily.
jim_halpert Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
dwight_schrute Well...
michael_scott There's a guy, there's a guy.
dwight_schrute There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?
michael_scott Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
dwight_schrute I can see the security guard's eyes.
jim_halpert No, no, don't do anything to them.
dwight_schrute I have to do something to his eyes.
dwight_schrute The eyes are the groin of the head.
jim_halpert Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
michael_scott We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.
jim_halpert Isn't that thing huge?
michael_scott It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
jim_halpert No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
michael_scott Aha!
dwight_schrute My hip bone!
michael_scott We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.
dwight_schrute Don't leave us!
michael_scott Save yourself!
dwight_schrute Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
jim_halpert Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-
michael_scott Dwight, you gotta move!
jim_halpert Damn it guys!
michael_scott Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
dwight_schrute I'm losing control of my bladder.
jim_halpert Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
dwight_schrute Did you say Karen?
michael_scott Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
jim_halpert No, I'm not doing that.
michael_scott Just say you wanna get back together.
jim_halpert No, I'm not doing that!
michael_scott It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
karen_filippelli Jim?
jim_halpert Hey Karen.
karen_filippelli Uh, what are you doing here?
jim_halpert First of all, hi.
karen_filippelli What are you doing here?
jim_halpert You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
dwight_schrute Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
jim_halpert Copy that.
karen_filippelli I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
karen_filippelli Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
dwight_schrute Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
karen_filippelli I'm taking Stanley.
dwight_schrute Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
michael_scott Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground.
karen_filippelli Jim, hang on a second?
jim_halpert Yes?
karen_filippelli So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
jim_halpert Yeah, trying to quit though.
karen_filippelli If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
jim_halpert Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you...
karen_filippelli
jim_halpert I mean, it's just that- You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
karen_filippelli Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
jim_halpert Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
karen_filippelli Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
jim_halpert I... will...
michael_scott We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.
michael_scott Um, wanted middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart. I can't do this.
stanley_hudson Michael? A word?
michael_scott Of course.
stanley_hudson I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
michael_scott Really?
stanley_hudson I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did Michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? Sometimes I say crazy things.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly I'm so sorry, Rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility.
jim_halpert Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
pam_beesly
andy_bernard Oh-oh, come on!
jim_halpert Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
oscar_martinez Okay, did you get it out of your system.
jim_halpert Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read.
toby_flenderson Fun?
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
toby_flenderson Really?
jim_halpert Yeah.
toby_flenderson What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins?
jim_halpert No, that wasn't fun.
toby_flenderson Did you even read it?
jim_halpert Of course I read it.
oscar_martinez How does it end?
toby_flenderson Who was the main character?
jim_halpert Angela. Nope. The ashes.
