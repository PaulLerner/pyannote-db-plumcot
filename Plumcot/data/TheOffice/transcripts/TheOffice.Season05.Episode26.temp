kevin At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own Ancho chilies. It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations. It's probably the thing I do best.
michael Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it?
ryan Who is it?
pam Who is it?
michael It's michael Scott. Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes.
michael Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and pam and Ryan. And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting.
dwight Wh--what are you doing?
michael If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
angela Okay.
michael Yes.
angela People are dressed inappropriately.
michael Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different.
jim Can you give us a hint?
michael When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
michael Oscar, what were you going to say?
oscar Nothing. I didn't say anything.
michael All right.
erin Do I still have a job here?
michael Not important. Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because ryan and pam are starting with us as salesmen.
dwight Wait, what?
stanley How is that going to work?
michael It's going to work very smoothly, because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from michael Scott Paper Company and--
phyllis You mean the clients you stole from us.
dwight Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
michael No, you lost those clients.
andy I call foul, sir.
michael Okay.
dwight You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
michael Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can.
meredith Don't fall in love with me, kid.
pam Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
phyllis It sure looked good on the mannequin.
pam Well, you have good taste.
phyllis Well, thanks. I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
pam What?
phyllis Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didn't have enough time for them?
pam Oh, I, um.
phyllis Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout.
angela The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
toby Can't you just not look at his feet?
angela Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet. Do your job!
toby Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have s*x with this girl, Cathy. Followed her to Scranton. Took the first job I could find in H. R. Later she divorced me. So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H. R.
michael There you are, my friend.
ryan Oh, thanks, man.
michael Pamela.
pam Thank, Michael.
michael Yep.
dwight Fresh hot ink.
stanley "New File System".
dwight Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
stanley I am not changing the way I do my files.
dwight No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
dwight When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine.
oscar I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
toby I could loan you a pair of socks.
oscar No.
toby No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
oscar I don't think so.
andy Andrew Bernard.
dwight Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
andy What are you still doing not at your desk?
dwight Did you even read the memo?
andy All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
dwight No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
andy Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
dwight Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing.
dwight We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that michael and pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
jim Can I address that?
dwight No, you're too close.
jim Okay.
dwight Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
stanley It's not right. I don't like it.
dwight He doesn't like it.
phyllis You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary. No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty.
dwight Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?
meredith I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
dwight Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take ryan hostage.
phyllis Those sound too harsh.
dwight No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things.
jim Of course. What is like a hostage?
dwight Excellent question.
andy We could write a strong-worded letter.
dwight Words will never be enough.
jim Strongly-painted picture.
dwight No, pictures are too interpretive.
jim Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to michael directly.
dwight Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs.
jim Great. See you upstairs.
dwight C'mon. Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action--
pam That one's great.
michael I know.
ryan You look so classy in that picture.
michael I do? Well--Where is that bowl?
jim Hey, you have a second?
michael michael Scott Paper Company only.
jim Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
michael Okay, well---
ryan Tough.
michael I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
jim This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now.
michael Against who?
ryan You. Us.
pam What?
ryan It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
michael The old michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with.
michael Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
pam Mm-hmmm.
michael That was us, right there.
pam We were something else.
ryan What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
michael Mm-hmm.
ryan Chiklis style.
michael Yeah, the Commish.
ryan Yes, but Chiklis Shield style. Not Commish style.
michael Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
creed It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
jim I know. Yeah, it's. kinda--
creed Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
jim That's true. That's right. Yeah.
creed Want to play a game?
michael Hey gang. Where you been?
dwight Lunch.
michael Where'd you eat?
phyllis A restaurant.
michael What'd you have, Stanley?
andy I had a salmon salad. With water, no ice. I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it. Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
stanley I had Mexican food.
michael So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you? Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? andy brought some salmon.
ryan That looks great.
michael Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?
ryan I can eat.
michael I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
dwight It's pony.
michael Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
andy Dijonnaise.
michael Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys.
pam Mmm.
toby Hey, Meredith. Can I talk to you privately for a second?
meredith About what?
toby Your outfit.
meredith What? What's wrong with my outfit?
toby You--you might consider pulling it down a touch. It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
meredith A bunch of prudes. You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals, but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes? Is that how it goes?
oscar Meredith, your boob is out.
meredith Fine.
angela Meredith, too far!
kelly Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
meredith It's casual day. Happy? . push;
creed No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
jim Well, what if I just do this?
creed You don't want to do that.
jim I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
ryan I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better?
dwight Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
ryan Exactly.
dwight That's my client.
ryan Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.
dwight Give me the phone.
ryan Things have been generally good.
dwight Give me the phone. Tell him dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
ryan Look, uh, Mr. Bart.
dwight Hi, Mr. Bart.
ryan At these prices with this service.
dwight Hey, it's dwight here. Give me the phone.
ryan You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
dwight dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up.
ryan No, no, no. Sir, don't listen.
dwight I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness. Ryan!
phyllis Ryan, hand the phone over.
ryan Stop flustering me, everybody!
stanley Who let this boy on the phone?
dwight Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years!
pam You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan.
dwight You're a secretary! What do you know?
ryan Okay.
dwight And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone. I'm confiscating this.
michael Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.
dwight We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
michael Who quits?
phyllis Me.
stanley And me.
andy Me too.
michael You guys gotta be kidding.
dwight No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance. stanley Paper Company.
michael I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money. There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one.
stanley You want us to apologize to you?
michael Yes I do.
andy That's completely backwards.
michael It's frontward's.
phyllis Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt. You should be apologizing to us.
stanley That's right.
dwight Right.
phyllis Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us.
michael No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view. 98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy.
michael I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without ryan and pam knowing.
dwight Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?
michael Whatever you guys did earlier.
dwight I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
michael Just do it, okay?
dwight I'll do--
michael Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
dwight I'll do the best I can.
michael Are you kidding me?
dwight Deceit does not come easy to me.
michael Okay, okay, okay.
erin I really love your outfit.
kelly Thank you so much for saying that. I can't believe that toby thinks this is inappropriate.
erin You look like J-Lo.
michael So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
stanley Are you giving us our clients back?
michael If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, "apology accepted", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
stanley Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
michael They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
phyllis Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about.
michael Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
stanley So?
michael Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. However, I rescind my apology.
dwight That's fair.
michael You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
darryl What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
ryan michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and pam to stay on.
pam He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
ryan I think you should get it. You really grew into it.
pam Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
ryan If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you.
pam Yeah.
ryan Thanks.
creed So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
jim Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
creed I thought you were gay.
jim Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
creed I don't know.
michael Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
jim Sure. Let me just finish this turn.
michael And Bingo was his name. Let's go.
creed Challenge.
michael I need your help. This whole Pam/ryan debate is screwing with my head.
jim I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that.
michael You're close with pam too.
jim Eh, she's nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
michael Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
jim Well, that's--
michael I like his hair.
jim Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale.
michael Okay.
jim He definitely stole my iPod.
michael That sounds pretty biased.
jim You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
michael Okay. Pam, pros.
jim Mm-hmm.
michael I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice.
jim That's not true.
michael I don't need to tell you that.
jim I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
michael I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
jim And I won't.
michael Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
jim All right. You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that's not a weird voice.
michael Oh, wow! Whoa!
jim Take it easy.
michael Ho-ho, man! Wow. Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have s*x with you unless you bring out the garba--
michael I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
andy You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
toby All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
dwight Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
toby All right, come. Sit down, Dwight.
dwight No.
toby I'm running this meeting.
dwight That's debatable.
toby It's not. It's not. Sit down or I am writing you up.
meredith Ooh, where has this guy been?
toby Casual Fridays are cancelled. Let's just not do it anymore.
andy You're running from the problem.
toby There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
michael Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat. Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just. drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been--
pam Just tell me.
michael I gave ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--
pam No, okay.
michael I'm sorry, sorry.
pam Okay, I get it. Why are you giggling? Is this a joke? Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
michael Yes, you did.
pam I did?
michael Yep.
pam For real, you're not kidding?
michael No, you--no.
pam I did?
michael No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great.
pam Oh, Michael, thank you. Thank you.
michael Oh, oh!
pam Thank you. You will not be sorry.
michael You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
pam Oh. I really thought I didn't get it.
michael Oh, really?
pam Yeah. 'Cause you said I didn't
michael Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.
pam What about Ryan?
michael I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
pam Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
michael I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here.
pam Thanks, Michael.
michael Oh! What's our receptionists name?
pam Erin.
michael Could you send her in?
pam Erin. michael wants to see you.
michael Hello.
erin Hi.
michael Have a seat.
michael This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go. Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard--
erin Oh, I can go.
michael He will be ushering you out.
erin Oh!
michael Oh, your face! Oh!
erin Is--do the people--
michael No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet.
erin Oh!
michael Oh.
erin Do they not like me, though?
michael I don't know, actually.
erin Okay.
