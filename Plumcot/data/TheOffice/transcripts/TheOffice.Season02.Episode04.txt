michael_scott Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
dwight_schrute That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
ryan_howard I don't want to be like "a guy" here. You know? Like, Stanley is the "crossword puzzle guy". And Angela has cats. I don't want to have a thing... here. You know, I don't want to be the "something guy".
jim_halpert Okay, you know what? I am going to be, uh, setting the agenda here. Okay? Can everybody gather up, please? Important announcement. Very important announcement.

stanley_hudson Ooh.
jim_halpert And, um...
pam_beesly ...Would You Rather?
jim_halpert Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
dwight_schrute Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
jim_halpert Okay, so... three books on a desert island? Angela.
angela_martin The Bible.
stanley_hudson That's one book. You've got two others.
angela_martin A Purpose Driven Life.
jim_halpert Nice. Third book?
angela_martin No.
jim_halpert Okay. Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Um, The DaVinci Code.
angela_martin The DaVinci Code!
jim_halpert Nice.
angela_martin I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
dwight_schrute Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question is there fire wood on the island?
jim_halpert I guess.
dwight_schrute Then I would bring an axe, no books.
jim_halpert Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
jim_halpert Nice. Smart.
dwight_schrute ...hollowed out, inside waterproof matches, iodine tablets, beet seeds, protein bars, NASA blanket, and, in case I get bored, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone. No, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Question did my shoes come off in the plane crash?
michael_scott Rule number four. In business, image is everything - Andre Agassi. This car is an investment. Right? If I have to take out a client or I'm seen around Scranton in it. I love it. I love this car. Do you like it?
ryan_howard Yeah.
jim_halpert Okay. Thought people read more books.
jim_halpert DVDs! Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Yes! Meredith?
meredith_palmer Legends of the Fall, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Legally Blond, Bridges of Madison County...
jim_halpert Wow.
pam_beesly Legends of the Fall?
jim_halpert Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
pam_beesly Well, I kind of liked Legal...
jim_halpert Wait, wait, wait. Pam. No. Do you understand? The... the game is Desert Island Movies, not guilty pleasure movies. Desert Island Movies are the movies you're going to watch for the rest of your life! Forever! Unforgivable.
pam_beesly I take it back.
jim_halpert Unforgivable.
pam_beesly I take it back!
jim_halpert Good.
meredith_palmer ...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
dwight_schrute Is this your car, Ryan?
michael_scott Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
ryan_howard Don't...
dwight_schrute Good shocks.
michael_scott Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...
ryan_howard That's actually a test prep book.
michael_scott ...for Phone. What?
ryan_howard That's a test prep for business school.
michael_scott Um, oh, thinking about business school?
ryan_howard I just got in. I applied, I go at night.
michael_scott Really?
ryan_howard Yeah.
michael_scott So you think you know a lot about business?
ryan_howard No, not yet.
michael_scott Uh huh.
ryan_howard Just started.
michael_scott Yeah. Quiz me.
ryan_howard I... wouldn't even know where to start.
michael_scott Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
dwight_schrute Do it.
michael_scott Quiz me up.
ryan_howard All right, um... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
michael_scott Uh...
michael_scott When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe... lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or Ryan would ever teach me.
ryan_howard Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
dwight_schrute Keep an existing...
michael_scott Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please? Uh, it's equal.
ryan_howard It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
michael_scott Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
dwight_schrute Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
michael_scott Okay, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
michael_scott You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.
dwight_schrute Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
michael_scott For instance, why don't you go to business...
dwight_schrute You should learn from him, right?
ryan_howard I am.
dwight_schrute Right?
ryan_howard I am.
michael_scott Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
dwight_schrute Stupid!
michael_scott I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So... so it's not the same thing. At all.
michael_scott Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
ryan_howard It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
michael_scott You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
jim_halpert Pam? Get us back into it.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Five movies. Go ahead.
pam_beesly Um, Fargo, um, Edward Scissorhands, Dazed and Confused...
jim_halpert Ooh, definitely in my top five.

pam_beesly All time favorite.
jim_halpert Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
dwight_schrute The Crow.
michael_scott I became a salesman... because of people, I love making friends. But then I was promoted to manager, at a very young age. I still try to be a friend first, but... You know? I'm very successful... your coworkers look at you differently. Huu, what do you think?
ryan_howard Maybe we should get some air.
michael_scott Nah, I'm okay.
ryan_howard I'm really uncomfortable.
jim_halpert All right. Let's move on. Let's move on to the main event. Who Would You Do?
kevin_malone Present company excluded?
jim_halpert Um, not neccessari...
kevin_malone Pam.
oscar_martinez Pam.

jim_halpert Who goes to business school?
dwight_schrute The temp.
jim_halpert He does?
dwight_schrute Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
pam_beesly You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
dwight_schrute He doesn't even know that I do that.
pam_beesly You should tell him.
dwight_schrute Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
pam_beesly Dwight.
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
jim_halpert You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
dwight_schrute Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
jim_halpert Yeah. You're right.
dwight_schrute Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
pam_beesly Kay.

jim_halpert Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.
michael_scott Well, I would definitely have s*x with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.
roy_anderson You're all gay.
michael_scott Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...
ryan_howard Hey, no, I can talk, I can talk, I can talk... this is great timing.
michael_scott Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...

michael_scott Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
dwight_schrute Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
michael_scott Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
dwight_schrute That's exactly what I said.
michael_scott Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?

michael_scott I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
