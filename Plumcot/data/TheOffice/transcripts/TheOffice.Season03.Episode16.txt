michael_scott Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
kevin_malone My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
michael_scott Huh?
kevin_malone I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
michael_scott Pop quiz.
kevin_malone ...What?
michael_scott Why is today a special day?
kevin_malone I almost died.
michael_scott Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
ryan_howard You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
michael_scott In business school, Kevin. Business school.
kevin_malone Wow.
ryan_howard If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid not to do it, right?
michael_scott A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
michael_scott Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
dwight_schrute "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.
dwight_schrute Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.
michael_scott Will they throw their hats, you think?
ryan_howard What?
michael_scott A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
ryan_howard Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
michael_scott Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.
ryan_howard ...It doesn't apply.
michael_scott I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! Whoa, hey!
ryan_howard Quit it!
michael_scott We have fun.
roy_anderson I can't for your art show tonight.
pam_beesly Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
roy_anderson I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
pam_beesly Thanks.
pam_beesly I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
roy_anderson Love ya.
pam_beesly You too.
jim_halpert Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
kelly_kapoor I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
pam_beesly Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God. You're so in love now.
pam_beesly Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
kelly_kapoor Oh, art show!
pam_beesly I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
kelly_kapoor ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
michael_scott Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? Whoo!
business_school_student Student ....Dude.
dwight_schrute ...Oh my God. Animal stool.
pam_beesly Dwight, what are you doing?
dwight_schrute Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
karen_filippelli Oh my God!
dwight_schrute BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
stanley_hudson Goooood bye.
angela_martin ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
michael_scott Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
ryan_howard ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
michael_scott I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
dwight_schrute We have... a bat... in the office.
toby_flenderson The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
angela_martin Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
jim_halpert Okay. Thanks. Animal control will be here at six.
dwight_schrute At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
jim_halpert I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
dwight_schrute What? What's so wierd?
jim_halpert The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... Oh well.
ryan_howard And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
michael_scott Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
dwight_schrute This is your job, Halpert.
jim_halpert Ow!
karen_filippelli Oh, what happened?
jim_halpert That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
karen_filippelli But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
jim_halpert What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
dwight_schrute No... no. One crisis at a time.
dwight_schrute If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
michael_scott So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand . Satisfied?
toby_flenderson Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
pam_beesly Oh! No, you should go.
toby_flenderson Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
michael_scott Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
ryan_howard Michael.
michael_scott ...And products!
ryan_howard What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
michael_scott Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
business_school_student Student #1 Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
michael_scott We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.
karen_filippelli Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
jim_halpert Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
karen_filippelli What glare?
jim_halpert The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
dwight_schrute I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
dwight_schrute Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
creed_bratton Sure.
dwight_schrute --to use sudden violence.
creed_bratton Okay.
dwight_schrute Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
creed_bratton What size?
business_school_student Student #2 What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
michael_scott ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
business_school_student Student #2 Has anyone ever come back?
michael_scott ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
business_school_student Student #3 How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
michael_scott Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
business_school_student Student #3 ...What?
michael_scott Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
business_school_student Student #1 By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
michael_scott ...Wait, Ryan said that?
kelly_kapoor What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
creed_bratton Animals can't feel pain.
kelly_kapoor Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
dwight_schrute Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
kelly_kapoor AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
kevin_malone I... am a hero!
michael_scott Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
business_school_student Student #2 But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
michael_scott David will always beat Goliath.
business_school_student Student #1 But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax...
michael_scott Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
business_school_student Student #1 But in the big picture...
michael_scott Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. SO SUCK ON THAT!
ryan_howard ...It wasn't personal.
michael_scott Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
ryan_howard Pack my--?
michael_scott You heard me, pack your things.
meredith_palmer I really want to come out!
creed_bratton Good night, Mary Beth!
jim_halpert So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
dwight_schrute Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
jim_halpert Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
dwight_schrute Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
dwight_schrute Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
pam_beesly ...And it's all from the same series.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode16 Oh.
pam_beesly Called 'Impressions.'
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode16 Oh.
pam_beesly Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode16 Maybe one day.
pam_beesly I hope so.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode16 Mmm.
pam_beesly I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. Hey, babe, how are you?
roy_anderson Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
pam_beesly Hey, Kenny.
kenny_anderson Hey Pam.
roy_anderson How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
dwight_schrute Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!
meredith_palmer Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
dwight_schrute Hold still, woman!
meredith_palmer Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
dwight_schrute ... ... You're welcome.
roy_anderson It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
pam_beesly Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.
roy_anderson To my place?
pam_beesly Maybe, I'm a little tired.
roy_anderson Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
pam_beesly Thank you.
ryan_howard Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
michael_scott Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
ryan_howard To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
michael_scott A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
oscar_martinez You're the one who said we needed more culture.
gil This is culture to you?
oscar_martinez It's her first try.
gil Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.
oscar_martinez Meaning what?
gil Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.
oscar_martinez Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
gil Yeah, exactly. That's why this is... motel art.
Artist#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode16 Thanks for coming.
michael_scott Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
pam_beesly Oh, Michael.
michael_scott Wow! You did these... freehand?
pam_beesly Yep.
michael_scott My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. ... How much?
pam_beesly What do you mean?
michael_scott I don't see a... price.
pam_beesly Um... you wanna buy it?
michael_scott Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
pam_beesly Uh-huh.
michael_scott That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
pam_beesly ... Thank you.
michael_scott What?
pam_beesly Do you have something in your pocket?
michael_scott ...Chunky. Do you want half?
pam_beesly No thank you.
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
ryan_howard It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
kelly_kapoor I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
