andy everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. dwight is no longer with us.
everyone What?! Why is that?
andy He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
angela So, he's alive.
andy Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
angela Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
andy How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
phyllis If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
oscar You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure.
oscar When the team left for Tallahassee, dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
andy I think that dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure.
oscar I am dying to know what's in there.
andy Yeah, I know, oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane.
creed Hi, hello.
andy Now, carefully. open the box.
creed It's a photo of all of us.
pam Aw, that's so sweet!
dwight A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
dwight Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!
nellie Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP. Robert
california I am loving the chemistry between you two.
nellie I am so happy dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George. Robert
california I bet. I'm excited.
nellie Trick. there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
dwight Ah!
nellie I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
dwight You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples.
jim Oh, that reminds me. Little something from all of us.
dwight Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. Four! Oh yeah!
nellie He doesn't even care.
dwight Don't even care!
jim This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh. sweet. Yeah.
darryl Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
andy Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
darryl I'll put you down for shortbreads.
andy Damn it.
toby Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
darryl No. No.
toby What?
darryl I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
toby You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? Or chess club, or?
darryl You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
toby That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.
darryl OK, great.
darryl All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
erin Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo. Elderly
woman Oh, here let me help.
erin I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
erin irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
irene When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.
erin Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida.
irene Thank you. Oh, what kind of tea is this?
erin Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
nellie Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias. Robert
california If I may, try holding the putter. yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here.
nellie Oh. Robert
california That's right. Your little finger.
darryl Would you like to buy some cookies?
kevin Cookies, eh?
kevin Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
darryl It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
kevin I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
toby Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
darryl You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
toby No, no, no. It's not fair. What if kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
kevin I do.
toby See?
darryl That doesn't mean anything. Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
kevin Oh, I definitely do.
darryl Huh. Hit the road, jack.
toby No, you hit the road, jack.
kevin Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
toby You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
kevin No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and. 69ed.
angela Ugh.
kevin Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts. no offence Oscar.
nellie Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
jim All right. So. I guess this is it.
dwight Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But. bye, bye. I win.
jim Goodbye, Dwight.
dwight Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo!
jim Well, he's Florida's problem now. Robert
california I'll let dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.
jim What's that? Robert
california I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.
jim I thought you liked the store? Robert
california Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.
jim Thank you. Robert
california But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us.
jim Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible. Robert
california I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.
dwight Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it! Robert
california Bravo, Dwight! Very good! Shame.
dwight The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre to the power of two.
nellie How did that look?
gabe I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
dwight I told you. Todd
packer When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-
dwight You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
jim All right. There he is.
dwight What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
jim Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
dwight What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'?
jim Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should-
dwight You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. Todd
packer Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?
dwight Silence. Todd
packer Aw, I'm just trying to-
dwight I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. But your face does look like the guy from Operation. Todd
packer That's. that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
dwight Different guy.
jim You know, I just think you should know that-
dwight That you look like the world's tallest hobbit.
jim Well, I tried. You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
erin Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
irene Just open the program and type in his user name.
erin Can you just do it?
irene Here, type in your password.
erin 'Erin123'
irene That's a terrible password. And you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat.
erin All right.
andy Hello?
erin That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. Oh. I fixed it.
andy Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. Oh, there we go. . push;
pam He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
jim No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
pam Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop dwight from doing this.
jim I tried. He will not listen.
pam Did you actually try your hardest?
jim Yes. my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
stanley Don't talk to me.
jim Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
pam If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
jim OK. All right.
darryl What's a skinny guy like toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe toby from two years ago.
phyllis Yeah.
kevin That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
darryl Thank you.
toby I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
darryl Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my chubby daughter?
phyllis Oh.
darryl Baby, if you're watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
kelly Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
pam Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
phyllis Make them kiss each other.
meredith Make them kiss me.
erin Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
andy No.
erin This is a tanned spot.
andy I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
erin Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
andy What?
erin I have a job here. I work for an old lady.
irene Hello!
erin Andy?
andy Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.
kevin This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided. that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
darryl No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
toby No.
kevin No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
darryl Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
kevin Hungrier.
toby 50?
kevin Hungrier.
darryl You're not talking. triple digits?
kevin Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. Again.
dwight Showtime.
jim Dwight.
dwight You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
jim OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
dwight Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
jim Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
dwight Jim, come on.
jim Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
dwight Uh-huh.
jim And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
dwight Wait. He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
jim Yes.
dwight That's two things.
jim Dwight, please.
dwight Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
jim OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
dwight You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
jim Dwight, come o-
dwight Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!
dwight Help! Help!
jim Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
dwight AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
jim Gross!
dwight Ah!
jim What? What, what, what, what, what?
dwight Oh, god! You. oh! My appendix-
jim I'm sorry.
dwight My wound hasn't healed yet.
jim I'm so sorry, I forgot.
dwight Oh, man!
jim You all right? You ok?
dwight Rrrah!
nellie Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
cathy I don't know. He's not picking up. Todd
packer Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.
nellie Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer. Todd
packer Sup?
phyllis What are you doing?
andy I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
oscar We knew. ryan told us.
andy Ryan, why didn't you tell me?
ryan Thought you checker my Tumblr?
andy You never update it.
ryan Well, I updated it.
andy Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
pam We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine.
dwight Huh, huh, huh!
jim What are you doing?
dwight I was trying to go-
jim Get up.
dwight Ok, ok.
jim Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
dwight Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
jim OK. What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
dwight Jackie Chan!
kevin Go.
darryl Hi. This is Alex.
toby And this is Sam.
darryl kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
kevin Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
darryl I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
toby Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
kevin Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
toby Don't make me be your pony, Kevin.
darryl Forget it, man.
kevin What do you mean?
darryl I'm out. And so is Toby.
darryl This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
toby Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
kevin No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. That is. hmph. that's ah. so good.
jim What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
dwight This. Ends. Now.
jim This is dangerous.
dwight Rrahh!
jim Why?
dwight Anything else you need to talk about?
jim Nope. I think that was it.
dwight Once again, it's show time. Robert
california What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution. Todd
packer If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is dwight Shrute. Robert
california I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.
nellie Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes. but not the man. You may not cancel his soul. Robert
california That was never on the table. Todd
packer Are you kidding? She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla! Robert
california And yet Todd, it's you who's fired. Todd
packer What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh?
darryl Hey, hey. They're back.
kelly Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
jim Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
kelly Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
phyllis Hey! Good to have you back.
stanley Good to be back.
pam Hey, stranger!
jim Hey.
pam Aw, I missed you.
jim I missed you.
pam Aw.
andy I'm going to Florida to get Erin. Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
