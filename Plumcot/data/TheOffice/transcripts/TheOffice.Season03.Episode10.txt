dwight_schrute Merry Christmas!
pam_beesly Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
dwight_schrute Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
pam_beesly Dwight, what uh...
dwight_schrute I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
pam_beesly Well, get it out of here.
dwight_schrute Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
jim_halpert Merry Christmas Dwight.
dwight_schrute Jim.
jim_halpert Wow. What have we got here?
dwight_schrute What does it look like?
jim_halpert Dead goose.
dwight_schrute And circle gets the square.
jim_halpert All right.
dwight_schrute So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
toby_flenderson Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.
dwight_schrute No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
dwight_schrute Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
dwight_schrute He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
jim_halpert Wow. Win-Win.
dwight_schrute Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
phyllis_vance I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
creed_bratton That's crazy. It's crazy.
toby_flenderson Dwight, you cannot keep that here.
dwight_schrute Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
toby_flenderson Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
dwight_schrute It's Christmas Toby.
toby_flenderson It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...
dwight_schrute Toby...
toby_flenderson I'm sorry.
dwight_schrute Please? Please?
toby_flenderson Clean it in your car.
pam_beesly I would like it off my desk.
dwight_schrute Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
michael_scott Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. 'Tis the ... ack. Hey! I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint...
pam_beesly Can I help you, Michael?
michael_scott I'm looking for the toy drive box.
pam_beesly It's behind you.
michael_scott OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
jim_halpert Wow. What kind of bike is that?
michael_scott Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
kevin_malone The tires look pretty worn.
michael_scott Well, that is probably from the test drive.
jim_halpert But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
michael_scott No.
andy_bernard Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
michael_scott Oh, thanks.
pam_beesly Michael?
michael_scott Yes? Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
pam_beesly I didn't, it's from corporate.
michael_scott OK. Did everybody get one of these?
pam_beesly Yup.
michael_scott Terrific. Good.
michael_scott This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend Carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
jim_halpert Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed.
creed_bratton And a happy holiday to you.
jim_halpert Carol.
carol_stills Hi, is Michael around here?
michael_scott There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde.
carol_stills Michael.
michael_scott Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
carol_stills What?
michael_scott Turn around, turn around. Come on.
carol_stills Get outta here.
michael_scott No, you get outta here.
andy_bernard Michael
michael_scott Yes.
andy_bernard If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
dwight_schrute Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
michael_scott Thank you.
carol_stills I really need a moment alone with you.
michael_scott Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. Berp.
carol_stills What is this?
michael_scott That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
carol_stills No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
michael_scott I know.
carol_stills I went on a ski trip.
michael_scott Right.
carol_stills Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
michael_scott Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
carol_stills Michael.
michael_scott And next to your kids. What?
carol_stills This is so weird.
michael_scott I don't understand?
jim_halpert It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. Is bold the right word?
carol_stills I think you're a really sweet guy.
michael_scott OK
carol_stills But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing . And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
michael_scott No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
carol_stills What are you talking about?
michael_scott I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
carol_stills Oh, no. Michael.
michael_scott And it's all inclusive.
carol_stills Michael...
michael_scott Yes.
carol_stills I'm sorry.
michael_scott No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
carol_stills I know.
pam_beesly Psst. Jim. Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA.
jim_halpert Are you serious?
pam_beesly They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
jim_halpert Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
pam_beesly So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. Sorry I didn't wrap it.
jim_halpert You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert No, because of the promotion.
pam_beesly Oh yeah.
jim_halpert It just feels a little bit, like...
pam_beesly No, I get it, of course. OK.
jim_halpert I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?
michael_scott I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
stanley_hudson You can't cancel a holiday.
michael_scott Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
stanley_hudson What does that mean?
michael_scott Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
pam_beesly Michael, what's going on?
michael_scott Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
jim_halpert Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
kevin_malone That's not fair.
dwight_schrute Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
michael_scott Fine! Have your party. Just no guests.
phyllis_vance But we invited guests.
michael_scott Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
michael_scott Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
pam_beesly I know.
michael_scott It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
pam_beesly OK, well, why are you laying like that?
michael_scott Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
pam_beesly Like what?
michael_scott Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
pam_beesly Well.. um I, I don't...
michael_scott And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
pam_beesly I don't need to know.
dwight_schrute Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
michael_scott Take it from Toby.
dwight_schrute Copy.
michael_scott Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
pam_beesly No, thank you.
michael_scott It's all... OK.
toby_flenderson Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- Why?
angela_martin Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
phyllis_vance I thought you said green was whorish.
angela_martin No, orange is whorish.
karen_filippelli Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle ... .
angela_martin It would never work here.
karen_filippelli Ok ... um, another idea was karaoke ...
angela_martin No.
karen_filippelli A Christmas drinking game ...
meredith_palmer Yes.
angela_martin God help you.
karen_filippelli What?
angela_martin These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave.
karen_filippelli You're kidding.
angela_martin You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. Please. Thank you. OK, thank you very much.
michael_scott What are you doing?
dwight_schrute We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
andy_bernard Hey, what's the haps?
michael_scott Carol?
dwight_schrute Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box.
dwight_schrute Why don't you just buy the whole song?
michael_scott I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
dwight_schrute Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
michael_scott Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.
michael_scott This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
pam_beesly I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
pam_beesly Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
karen_filippelli Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
pam_beesly Um, usually like that.
karen_filippelli Does anyone ever stand up to Angela or..?
pam_beesly I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.
karen_filippelli Right.
pam_beesly Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
karen_filippelli Oh cool, yeah.
pam_beesly That could really be fun.
karen_filippelli Oh, thank you.
pam_beesly You guys do a raffle?
karen_filippelli Yeah, we do a raffle...
toby_flenderson Hey Kev.
kevin_malone Hey.
angela_martin This should've been up yesterday.
phyllis_vance It'll be all right.
angela_martin What is that? The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" There's no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties."
pam_beesly There is now. We just started it.
angela_martin Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
karen_filippelli What's your funding?
angela_martin Two hundred dollars.
pam_beesly What's ours again?
karen_filippelli Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
pam_beesly Oh right.
kelly_kapoor Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
angela_martin No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
kevin_malone Then why are there two flyers?
karen_filippelli Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
kevin_malone Right.
karen_filippelli And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
pam_beesly Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.
kevin_malone I didn't see where it was.
jim_halpert Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
karen_filippelli I think that's a really good option...
dwight_schrute Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
pam_beesly You can't do that.
dwight_schrute As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
andy_bernard Umm... I'm number three.
dwight_schrute You're number four.
andy_bernard Yeah, but I'm number three.
dwight_schrute Ah, no. You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
jim_halpert OK, I think I can help here.
dwight_schrute Ok, good
jim_halpert As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
dwight_schrute OK, this is stupid.
jim_halpert Could you please keep it down? I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid.
dwight_schrute No no, no, wait, wait, wait Permission to join the Validity Committee.
jim_halpert Permission denied.
dwight_schrute Damn it!
andy_bernard Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. C'mon, my treat.
michael_scott All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
andy_bernard That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
michael_scott Hooters?
andy_bernard No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too.
michael_scott Ah, I need my entourage Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
ryan_howard Ah man, I can't.
michael_scott Why not?
ryan_howard I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.
michael_scott Ok, feel better.
ryan_howard Thanks.
michael_scott C'mon Jim, let's go.
jim_halpert OK. Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
ryan_howard Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
michael_scott Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
andy_bernard So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today." Thank you. Michael Head of the table.
dwight_schrute Get out Jim. Actually, um... Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
michael_scott Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.
andy_bernard So she looks at me right, and she goes, "I'm sorry, don't I even know you?" After a year, a year of buying lattes from her, do you believe that?
jim_halpert Yes.
dwight_schrute I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
michael_scott Carol used to drink lattes.
dwight_schrute What're you talking about?
michael_scott She would get this little foam mustache...
dwight_schrute Carol had a mustache?
michael_scott And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny.
dwight_schrute What are you guys talking about?
michael_scott She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
dwight_schrute Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
dwight_schrute It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael?
michael_scott I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...
andy_bernard No.
dwight_schrute Who are you calling?
michael_scott I'm just gonna call her.
andy_bernard Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, we need your help.
Waitress#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode10 What can I get for 'ya?
andy_bernard I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes.
andy_bernard One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
phyllis_vance You should, you should put out salt for the rims
pam_beesly That's a great idea.
angela_martin Phyllis?
phyllis_vance I was just getting a snack.
pam_beesly You can have your snack in here.
angela_martin Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
phyllis_vance OK.
kevin_malone I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
ryan_howard I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
roy_anderson So I only use three?
pam_beesly If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
roy_anderson OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
pam_beesly Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
roy_anderson OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
pam_beesly Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
roy_anderson Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later.
pam_beesly Bye.
karen_filippelli He's cute. You should date him.
pam_beesly Oh, yeah... Maybe.
dwight_schrute Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
the_chef No, it's Usuba.
dwight_schrute Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
the_chef Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity.
dwight_schrute Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode10 at bar I think he'd know.
michael_scott Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
andy_bernard Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
cindy I don't know.
michael_scott Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.
andy_bernard You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. Watch, watch, watch, watch. Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
michael_scott You're right. That's good.
pam_beesly Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .
angela_martin I have a very important announcement to make... about... your paychecks. Umm... Your paychecks will be arriving as scheduled on Friday. And they will be in the correct amount that they are normally in... Please stand by for a very important announcement... refer.. for further regarding your paycheck!
angela_martin I need to know if I can start the party?
dwight_schrute Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!
andy_bernard This drink...
michael_scott I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
angela_martin Did Michael give you permission to do this?
dwight_schrute Start the party.
angela_martin Also, I would like to inform you that, um, as a special treat, my party will be starting early. In fact, it will be starting right now
pam_beesly Our party is also starting now
karen_filippelli Yup.
karen_filippelli All right Stanley. Woo.
pam_beesly Good choice.
angela_martin Welcome Hannah. You will not be disappointed.
hannah_smotridgebarr Why would I be disappointed?
angela_martin I said you wouldn't be disappointed.
angela_martin Meredith, if you don't come to my party, you will be very, very sorry.
meredith_palmer Is that a threat?
angela_martin No, it's an invitation.
pam_beesly We have vodka!
karen_filippelli Lots of it!
kevin_malone I hear Angela's party will have double-fudge brownies. It will also have Angela. Double fudge... Angela... double fudge... Angela Hmmm...
angela_martin Brownies. Cupcakes.
kevin_malone Don't push it.
karen_filippelli Are we taking this too far? You know what, I don't think we're taking this far enough. What?
pam_beesly I got goose bumps.
angela_martin I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
michael_scott Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. I see steak.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode10 Excuse me.
michael_scott Excuse me Ah, un guard. Family style.
jim_halpert No, it's not.
andy_bernard Cindy, Cindy.
michael_scott I don't think... I love it!
andy_bernard I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.
michael_scott I don't know what he's doing.
andy_bernard This is great.
dwight_schrute Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
jim_halpert Oh, she's asleep.
dwight_schrute Oh... Narcolepsy.
jim_halpert Probably.
andy_bernard Now open your eyes and describe it to me.
cindy I... don't know, it has four bed rooms and a loft...
dwight_schrute Oh my gosh, now she's up.
jim_halpert And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
dwight_schrute Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
jim_halpert Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
kelly_kapoor What d'ya think?
stanley_hudson Fruity and delicious.
kelly_kapoor See, I told you. You want one Meredith?
meredith_palmer No thanks. They're too sweet.
karen_filippelli Hey, so what's the status.
ryan_howard Looks like they forgot the power cord.
pam_beesly What?
karen_filippelli Oh, you're kidding me?
ryan_howard No.
karen_filippelli Oh, you guys, guys, um... I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the karaoke machine.
kelly_kapoor Well that blows.
darryl_philbin Hang on little ladies. You don't need this thing, I'll go grab my synthesizer.
all@ Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
phyllis_vance Hi.
darryl_philbin Hey. Hey, look, when you get done with your... meeting, you should, uh, come to the break room. We're having a party.
phyllis_vance Oh, ok.
darryl_philbin All right. Se you later...
hannah_smotridgebarr These nuts are really hard to crack.
angela_martin Try harder then. Uh uh. No one has seconds until everyone's had some.
kevin_malone You've got to be kidding!
angela_martin You've got to be kidding. {Kevin takes bite of brownie]
phyllis_vance Cold, huh?
ryan_howard Huh?
phyllis_vance Maybe that'll help. Is it cold in there?
andy_bernard They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!
michael_scott You know what we should do?
andy_bernard What?
michael_scott We should invite them to the Christmas party.
andy_bernard Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.
michael_scott Oh, you are such mench my friend.
michael_scott OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend.
jim_halpert I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
michael_scott The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.
amy Cindy That rocks.
michael_scott Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.
amy Cindy Thanks! I, I wanna give you something.
michael_scott Oh. That's what she said.
michael_scott Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.
andy_bernard My new girlfriend.
angela_martin Where's Dwight?
amy Cindy Is he the hot one or the giant baby?
michael_scott The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
phyllis_vance There's another party in the break room.
michael_scott Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.
angela_martin Hey, excuse me! Waitress lady! Hey, where do you think you're going with that?
amy Cindy I thought I could have it.
angela_martin You can't have it I don't walk into your house and steal your Hello Kitty backpack.
michael_scott Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
dwight_schrute Hey! It's Angela! Hey!
michael_scott We're going to ...
kevin_malone I want you to know. That I'm happy for you. I wish nothing but...
michael_scott I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. And... my question to you is do you agree?
Other#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode10 waitress Do I agree about what?
michael_scott Do you agree about what? Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute.
Other#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode10 waitress What're you talking about?
michael_scott What're you talking about?
kevin_malone And I'm here to remind you of the mess you left when you went away. It's not fair, to deny me of the cross I bear that you give to me. You, you, you, you, you, you, you oughta know ta know.
jim_halpert All right
angela_martin Did you have fun at Benihana's?
dwight_schrute No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.
angela_martin I've had the worse day here
karen_filippelli Dwight, you won the raffle!
dwight_schrute No... way! Yeah!
karen_filippelli Open it! Open it ! Open it!
dwight_schrute Oh.
karen_filippelli Do you like it?
dwight_schrute Walkie-talkies.
pam_beesly Can I talk to you a second?
dwight_schrute Yes!
karen_filippelli Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
pam_beesly In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.
karen_filippelli Angela, we've been hearing really great thing about uh... your brownies and we were hoping you'd consider merging into two parties.
angela_martin I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
pam_beesly Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
angela_martin Oh, I may have seen it somewhere. Is it this one?
pam_beesly Mmm. Hmm.
karen_filippelli Yeah, thanks.
pam_beesly We'll go tell everyone.
karen_filippelli OK.
andy_bernard and Michael And if you want love, we'll make it. Swim in a big sea of blankets. Take all your big plans and break 'em. This is bound to take awhile. Your body is a wonderland. Your body is a wonderland.
andy_bernard Your hands.
all@ Your body is a wonderland.
andy_bernard I'll use my hands on it.
all@ Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face...
kelly_kapoor Whatever we deny or embrace. For worse or for better. We belong, we belong, we belong together... Ryan...
michael_scott When you know, you just know.
kevin_malone Right.
michael_scott Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
roy_anderson Which one is she?
michael_scott It's... it's one of those two.
roy_anderson You don't know?
kevin_malone Dude, you should know.
michael_scott Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
michael_scott I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
michael_scott Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.
amy Cindy You know where I am.
michael_scott Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile
amy Cindy Oh.
michael_scott Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.
creed_bratton Spinnin' n reelin with love. Give it the time, I might come back down. But it feels so good. My feet don't touch the ground. Wha..wha..wild. Wha..wha..wild. Well everybody knows, I'm crazy about 'ya...
dwight_schrute Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
angela_martin Copy, Possum. What's your twenty?
karen_filippelli No way.
jim_halpert What a horrible, horrible movie that was.
karen_filippelli And now we get to remember it forever.
jim_halpert Thank you.
karen_filippelli Thank you.
amy Cindy Hey.
michael_scott Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
amy Cindy Hey. This party blows, so we're gonna leave.
michael_scott No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
amy Cindy Cool...
michael_scott Where do you wanna go?
amy Cindy I... We're just gonna take off.
michael_scott I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
amy Cindy No... I have school.
michael_scott You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
amy Cindy Merry Christmas.
dwight_schrute Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
michael_scott That waitress was the one.
jim_halpert No. She wasn't.
michael_scott How can you be sure?
jim_halpert Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately three hours ago.
michael_scott Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
jim_halpert Sorry.
michael_scott I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
jim_halpert You what?
michael_scott I, I put a mark on her arm. So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Oh, why do I feel like crap?
jim_halpert You just had a rebound.
michael_scott I had rebound? Yeah.
jim_halpert Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
michael_scott I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
angela_martin Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum..
michael_scott Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...
angela_martin ... Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum
oscar_martinez Too soon.
angela_martin I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
dwight_schrute pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
dwight_schrute Bye Pam.
pam_beesly Night.
jim_halpert Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
pam_beesly We should get him a bus ticket. To make his trip easier.
jim_halpert Oh no, that would be great.
pam_beesly It costs seventy five dollars.
jim_halpert Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
pam_beesly Ohh...
dwight_schrute What the? "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone?
