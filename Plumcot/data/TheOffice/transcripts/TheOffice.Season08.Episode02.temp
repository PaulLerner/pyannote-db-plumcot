jim Hey, so this isn't matching up with this. and I'm not sure which one's right. Can you just hunt down the original for me?
kevin Yes. Me do.
jim Alright.
jim Hey Kev, what were you saying before about the paperwork?
kevin Me do it now. Go. Stop worry.
pam Kevin, do you feel OK?
kevin Me feel good. Body strong. Sleep big last night.
pam Yeah, I think we should get him to the hospital.
jim Yeah, alright Kev why don't you come with us?
oscar No, guys.
angela No, he's fine.
oscar He's fine.
angela He's always been like that.
pam No he hasn't.
angela I mean, he's gotten worse over the years. .
oscar He's making a statement. It's an ironic comment on our expectations of him. A funhouse image of our model of Kevin.
kevin You keep think that.
kevin Me mechanic not speak English. But he know what me mean when me say "car no go", and we best friends. So me
think why waste time, say lot word when few word do trick?
andy Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do.
kevin Thank.
andy Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code. And what we're talking about is. basically the speech equivalent. to just wearing underpants. Sometimes words, you no need use. but need need for talk talk.
kevin But save time. More success.
jim Does it save time though? ‘Cause we've been here for about an hour.
kevin No me fault.
pam Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time.
kevin Many small time make big time.
andy What are you gonna do with all this time?
kevin See world.
pam Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.
jim K, Kevin, are you saying "See the world"? or "Sea World?"
kevin See world. Oceans. Fish. Jump. China.
jim No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. ‘Cause I still don't know if you're saying "Sea World" or "see the world, " and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.
kevin Fine, fine. I'll talk normally.
kevin When me President, they see. They see.
dwight This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet. . the Pyramid.
phyllis Ooh, why is it shaped like that?
dwight So, you can tell your
clients "Unleash the power of the pyramid. "
pam It's huge. How much does it weigh?
dwight Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds.
ryan How much memory does it have without the booster?
dwight Fifty L.
ryan I'm sorry, " L"?
jim How many L to a K?
dwight You're really going to want the booster.
stanley How on earth are we supposed to sell. ?
jim I'll take five.
phyllis Andy, don't make us sell this stupid thing.
andy Oh, no no no no no. This is Dwight's meeting.
dwight Thank you.
andy I just wanted to pop in and get your opinions on ties. and tie clips. Which combo do you think robert is going to like more? What do you think, C-SPAN?
oscar . "C-SPAN"?
andy Yeah. C-SPAN, cocker spaniel. Spaniel because of your Spanish bloodline and cocker cause. .
dwight Is this really the best use of our collective time?
andy I am still forming a first impression with Robert. Once it is formed, we can all relax. Ok, I'm sorry to hijack your meeting , D dub dog. had to pull rank.
dwight OK, let's look at some ties.
dwight Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise.
dwight Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
erin Um, D-Dog, you have a message.
pam Erin, you don't need to call him that.
erin andy wants us to, P-Dog.
darryl It's ok E-Dog, just who called?
erin Justine. She said she's coming by later.
jim Your ex-wife?
kevin Wait, I thought she was a **** and you ******* hated her guts?
darryl No no no no. I like her.
kevin Well I'm just quoting you. I would never say that about her. I don't know the woman.
darryl Nah man, we get along now. Real well.
jim Wow. Alright. Can't wait to meet her.
darryl I'll introduce you.
darryl Yeah, we had a few fights, I suppose. But last night we put a lot of that to bed. I can't tell you what I did with my ex wife last night. . I have to sing it. We took a shower, we were naked. We ska dap dap doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
andy Hi Dad!. . Ahhh. . oh boy.
robert Hello, Andy. Excellent tie.
erin Would you be requiring a cold beverage while you're here?
robert I'd love some coffee.
robert I was looking over your projections, and I think we can do better.
andy Are you factoring in the. whole national . economy. . declining and all that?
robert Andy, do you know why I chose you?
andy I think I can sum it up with what I think is your favorite ice cream flavor. . vanilla?
robert Vanilla? No no no no. You'll never guess in a million billion years you'll never guess.
andy You were saying you chose me. . There was a reason?
robert Andy, can you inspire? Do you have that skill set?
andy Can I inspire? I don't know!. . I don't know.
robert Oh! Thank you. Uh. .
erin Oh, sorry.
robert You can just put it down.
erin Oh
robert That is very cold.
erin Yeah. It's old.
robert Why would I. . ?
erin I asked if you wanted a cold beverage and you said "coffee". .
andy Why don't we get robert a nice hot fresh cup and I will have this.
erin Andy, you don't want that.
andy I've been craving a freezing cup of old coffee. Mmm. .
erin Sorry.
robert You like her.
andy I do.
robert She likes you.
andy You know, we've both been into each other at different times and just never really synced up. Now we're in this weird dance. .
robert I'm afraid you've lost my interest.
oscar Let me call you back.
meredith I gotta go.
robert If the office superstore was supposed to put us little suppliers out of business, why are we still here?
robert Ah.
kevin This is where we go
robert Oh, you'd go someplace else. That's not it, that's not the answer.
kevin It's a answer.
robert It's a wrong answer.
kevin There are no wrong answers.
robert Take a look at where you are, where you once worked in a dying industry, you now work at it's birth. Those superstores are terrified of us. Anybody know why?
phyllis Wait. . they're terrified?
robert Let me tell you how I buy something these days. I know what I want I go on the internet, I get the best price. Or I don't know what I want and I go to a small store that can help me. The era of personal service is back. You are back. You'll find that customers will pay our higher prices and then they will thank us, and we will say to them "you are welcome. " Andrew, I chose you for a reason. Lead these people. Show me the best numbers this place has ever seen. Last quarter we saw 4% growth. Double it.
andy You got it.
robert Double.
andy Done.
robert I'm not kidding.
andy Neither am I, it's already done. Hah, I'm just kidding, it's going to take some time.
robert Double.
jim Hey.
andy What's up, guys? Just thought we'd have a little rap session, talk about business. see how things are going? Ahem.
jim Why don't you start?
andy If no one else wants to? I was just thinking about Robert. man. What a boss. Just throws down goals, you know? Anyway, how's the sales doubling . project going?
phyllis Yeah, how are we supposed to do that? We can't just press a magic button.
andy OF course not. There's no magic button. You have to summon that.
stanley If we could just double our sales, we already would have. You're not making any sense.
jim He brings up two good points. Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
andy Dwight, anything?
dwight We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.
andy You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box. If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? Tuna.
jim New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door.
andy Fart. . good Sesh. That leg's asleep. . push;
justine Hello. I'm looking for darryl Philbin?
kevin Don't! oh, you must think. I'm not. I'm using the fax, this isn't, no wait. I'm not supposed to represent the company. Right? There's usually an erin here.
justine Ok. . ?
kevin So. DARRYL! A GIRL!
darryl rub a dub dub. I got scrubbed. ‘Sup, darlin'? Everybody, this is Justine. This is jim and Oscar, everybody.
meredith Hi.
kevin Kevin.
justine Can we. . go some place private?
darryl Follow me, I got a space. After you. I've been thinking about you all mornin'. I don't know what you did, I can barely walk today.
andy D-Bone. There you are.
dwight Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie. ? Lick the spoon?
andy No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about.
dwight Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.
andy I know, right?
dwight Right?
andy Yeah. um, how is everything?
dwight Good. Really really good.
andy Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
dwight Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
andy Oof. What are you gonna do about that?
dwight I don't know, what do you mean?
andy There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales.
dwight You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! And I'll do mine. . walnuts?
kevin No!
angela Have you seen this?
pam Parenting? Yeah. This is Cici's favorite magazine. She loves the pictures of babies.
jim She looks at it when she's on the potty, and she makes the faces.
angela Have you read it? Has an adult member of your family read this particular issue?
pam I flipped through it.
angela So you saw the article on the importance of taking frequent walks while you're pregnant?
pam Of course.
jim We know that.
pam Yeah.
angela I will be taking a morning walk and an afternoon walk. Would you like to join me?
pam That sounds nice.
angela Great.
jim You have a walking buddy.
pam I do.
andy Thanks for coming in guys.
phyllis You don't have to thank us for coming in, it's our job.
andy Well I never got thanked for coming into a meeting and I always wanted to be so I'm gonna thank people.
meredith What's with the blanket?
andy This is what's under the blanket.
oscar We don't get it.
andy These are incentives. It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking
yourselves "Well, how does this work?"
pam Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.
andy You're exactly right and you get a point.
pam Oh.
ryan Uh, is that a vibrator?
andy Twenty points.
meredith How does one get a point?
andy I've outlined the exact parameters in an email, so check your spam folders, but basically you do your job better, you get points. So, collect fifteen points and redeem them for this polar bear.
kelly Why is it all kid stuff and a vibrator? It's so gross.
andy There's lots of stuff. John Irving, collected works, Twenty-two points. Or, you can pool your points and redeem fifty-five for this maternity shirt.
stanley How ‘bout you want us to work harder, pay us more.
andy I can't.
kelly This point system is really insulting.
andy Ooh I didn't mean to offend you, and I hope you'll forgive me because I am very very. Sari. Sixteen points.
kelly That's a tablecloth.
jim What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
andy That's a crazy amount of points.
jim But, what if?
andy Well, what do you want?
jim I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy.
andy Alright. For five hundred points, I will wear a dress to work.
jim That's pretty good. What about uh, for a thousand points?
andy I'll run naked through the parking lot with a donut on my ding-dong. Yeah? You like that? Alright! For five thousand points, I will let you tattoo whatever you want on the stern of the old SS Bernard!
group Ooooh!
oscar Really?
jim Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
andy Swear to God, hope to die. Now let's get to work!
jim Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case. let's get to work.
dwight Yeah!
pam Yeah! Whoo!
jim I can have it to you by the beginning of next week. Alright? Thanks very much. Uh, Phyllis! Bracken Auto?
phyllis Ask for Donald, Karen's bananas.
jim Ok.
andy T-bag bone.
jim Andrew.
andy Have you noticed a little bit of a mood shift around here?
jim No, I didn't notice anything.
andy Really? Because I sat next to stanley for years. . and this is nap time. Open eye nap time. He balances the phone on his shoulder and just powers down. Now look at him.
stanley You've got to unleash the power of the Pyramid!
jim I don't know what to tell you, man.
andy You think it has something to do with that incentive program?
jim Oh, one hundred percent. We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
andy Bah. I think people thought I was kidding when I said that.
jim Nah, you definitely weren't kidding. And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.
andy Hundred and twenty points.
jim Yeah. Big sale. Don't worry about it though, I don't really care about the points. I would like a point receipt though. Hey! Yes, this is jim Halpert calling for Donald. can you hold on for one second? Thank you very much.
pam Who talked to Maggie at Kaufman's?
erin Yes!
jim and I'm back. How are you sir?. . I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
pam Where's Angela?
andy Hey Kevin, what are you doing?
kevin Don't talk to me!
andy Hi, Professor Frank, andy Bernard, class of '95. Hey there, um, I'm a huge fan of your management book, Management. Um, quick question. I may be missing a chapter here. De-Incentivizing. What are your strategies? Looking for a real blow to morale. uh why? Well, um I guess you could say I'm in one of those classic ass tattoo incentive situations.
andy Took ‘em one day.
pam Ready! "I'm not as think as you drunk I am!"
ryan I like it, I like it!
pam Do Not Resuscitate.
andy OK, keep in mind, it's not too late to choose another prize and there are some great new additions. My car for a thousand points. . or best offer.
phyllis What else you got?
pam Oh, and then this was Phyllis's idea. So nasty Phyllis!
pam We were hoping you could do something like this. Tattoo
artist So, coming out of his butt is a.
pam Baby. Tattoo
artist Baby.
pam Yes. Tattoo
artist Yeah, no problem.
andy We should think about this. does anyone have any better ideas?
stanley I like what we have.
meredith Looks good.
erin Yeah.
kevin For sure.
andy Just need a second outside.
jim Gettin' psyched up?
andy Yeah.
jim Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this.
andy Tunes. what am I doing here? Why did robert pick me? . .
confession I don't know what I'm doing.
jim I mean, do you like it? You having fun? Tell you this, everybody else is having a lot of fun. . and you did that.
andy My ass is only so big, I mean I can't do this everyday.
jim But I think it's big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea. . which, by the way, I can't wait for.
andy No one expects me to go through with this, right?
jim Absolutely not.
andy Let's ink. my stink!
andy My heart belongs to music. But my ass belongs to these people.
group Whoa!
andy Do your worst! Tattoo
artist Uh, you can keep your pants on actually. if just drop ‘em down a bit, that'd be great.
andy They are already off, my good sir. Tattoo
artist I'd really prefer they not be down.
andy Well, I think down's better. Sweating pretty heavily down there.
pam Do you think you could work from this? we made some small adjustments. Tattoo
artist OK, you want me to.
pam Just a few adjustments Tattoo
artist Alright, let's begin.
andy This is where I grin and be-YOW OW! Tattoo
artist That was just the cotton swab.
andy Invest in softer cotton, sir. OW! Oh! Oooh! oh, whoa!!
dwight Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it.
dwight DRAW SOME BLOOD!
andy AHHHHH!!!!!!!
robert Why did I choose andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
andy It's a Nard Dog! That's my nickity-name! I love it, I love it!
jim Pull up your pants.
robert There's something about an underdog that really inspires. the unexceptional.
pam Um, what should we talk about?
angela Well, we could talk about an ethical dilemma I'm having.
pam Oh yeah, sure. Um, I hope I can help.
angela A coworker of mine is drinking caffeine while pregnant, and I don't know if I should call social services about it.
pam Angela, that's pretty transparently me.
angela Maybe.
pam You know it's just herbal tea.
angela In mugs with trace amounts of coffee!
pam Yeah. I think you should call social services.
angela I already did.
pam You know, maybe we should just have our own pregnancies and not pretend like we're in this together.
angela Fine.
pam Fine.
