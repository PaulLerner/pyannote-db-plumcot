kevin So, uh. you found a band for your wedding yet?
pam No.
kevin 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
jim Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
phyllis Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
pam Yeah?
phyllis Yeah, pretty stationery.
pam Oh, thanks!
angela I didn't get mine yet.
pam Uh.
pam There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but . it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
michael Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I. D. photos today. Gotta represent.
phyllis Uh, on or off? I. D.
photographer Off.
phyllis Okay.
dwight Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
phyllis Excuse me.
dwight Clown paint.
dwight I. D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
michael That's a nice tie.
ryan Thank you.
michael That is. who makes that?
ryan Um, I don't.
michael Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
ryan Um. let's um, let's keep our clothes.
oscar It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels. it's. and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed.
michael What's the dealio?
toby Just letting oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
michael What's the problem?
oscar Angela!
toby It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
oscar Since Christmas.
michael So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
oscar No.
toby Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
michael Yes.
toby Here's how I usually handle
this all I do is listen.
michael Yeah?
toby These things just have a way of working themselves out.
michael Okay.
toby It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry. they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
michael What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So.
toby Okay.
michael Okay. what?
toby That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
michael Yeah, well. that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part. assuming we don't get downsized. Uh, Pam, will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please?
michael A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
angela Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
michael No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
oscar What's the next one?
michael Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You. you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
angela Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
michael Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
michael Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
angela I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
michael Come on, seriously, that?
oscar I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the.
michael Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
pam Win!
michael Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
oscar No.
angela That's. no.
michael Okay. well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
angela How about, I leave it up?
oscar How 'bout, she takes it down?
pam How about, angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
michael Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is. make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
pam Win.
oscar Fine.
angela But, it.
michael It is done!
pam Win
photographer No, you're all good.
creed Great.
pam Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code.
angela Oh. Thanks.
angela It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
toby You solved it?
michael Yes.
toby Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out.
michael Are those all the other complains?
toby Mmm-Hm.
michael I would like to see those please.
toby I. I can't do that.
michael You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
toby That.
michael Okay. There! No more conflict. I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. All right. is that it?
toby It's all Dwight's.
toby Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
michael Ohh. God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
photographer Are you sure?
dwight Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
photographer 
michael This is from Kevin. He says stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed. huh. Duh, duh. creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
pam Nice.
michael You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
toby Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year.
michael How many of you have at one time gone to toby to complain about another employee? And. did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? That is outrageous! I love this place. and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering. Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/angela dispute?
angela You already did me.
michael That's what she said. The thing is, Angela. you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted". ?
toby Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
michael Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
dwight Whoa. wha. wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
pam Um. let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
michael All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And . okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
pam Wait, what did it say?
michael Uh. "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?" Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
pam I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her. and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
michael Here is a kelly
complaint "ryan never returns my calls. " Ugh, join the club.
ryan My voicemail's really spotty. sometimes.
kelly I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
toby To your HR representative.
kelly To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
toby Fine, I'll take your name off. So no one will know.
michael Makin' progress. Yes?
jim dwight tried to kiss me.
michael What?!
jim And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
dwight That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
jim Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
dwight Okay, question. When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
toby Sure.
michael Stanley.
pam Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
michael You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
anglea I didn't do it!
pam I find that hard to believe. considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe. . push;
michael Someone complained that the men's room is "whites only". Stanley, you know that's not true.
stanley I didn't say that.
creed Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door?
michael Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
phyllis No, I never said any such thing. angela and I are close.
michael And. also, Phyllis, stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
phyllis stanley and I are close, too.
stanley We sit close.
michael Oh. ok.
toby Just take it.
pam I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
jim Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
pam Don't take her side.
jim Well, what does Roy think about everything?
pam I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
jim You mean your thoughts and feelings?
pam Yeah.
jim Yeah.
phyllis I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
angela Yes, that's the problem.
phyllis I guess so.
michael Okay, well. all settled, then.
phyllis I don't like you.
michael OK, Ryan. You told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell?
creed I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
michael All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable.
solution Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
kevin I accept your decision!
jim Hey. you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I. D. taken together.
dwight That doesn't make any sense.
jim Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
photographer Smile.
dwight No.
dwight I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
jim This came out really well. There you go.
dwight This is humongous. I am not a security threat.
jim Oh.
dwight And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
jim What did I write?
dwight I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
toby Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
dwight What box?!
phyllis But I didn't report your snoring-
stanley Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays.
michael Uh. Dwight.
dwight Ah. agh. dgh. Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
michael Okay! Calm down.
dwight No! You calm down! Who's side is toby on? Who's side are you on?
michael Hey, hey!
dwight Him or me?
michael Stop.
dwight Him or me? I cannot work with jim anymore.
michael Okay.
dwight Either he goes, or I go.
michael Dwight.
dwight You choose!
michael Stop.
dwight One of us is out of here by the end of today!
michael Oh. kay.
dwight I am not bluffing!
michael Okay.
dwight Okay?
michael Yes.
dwight Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
michael Mm-hmm.
dwight I deserve this. You know I do!
michael You know your I. D. says you're a security threat?
dwight You have till five.
dwight Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
michael Okay. you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
michael Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
michael Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect jim Halpert. " "Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think jim Halpert paid them to. "
jim Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
michael "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer. " "jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can. " Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone. "
jim That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just. took 'em all out.
michael "Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'. "
jim Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
michael "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier. "
jim Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
michael The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
jim Maybe Stanford would be cool.
dwight It's a good market. Higher volume.
jim Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
dwight I have a girlfriend.
jim Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
michael Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
dwight So, you going to transfer jim or not?
michael Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
dwight I want an answer by tomorrow.
michael Okay. Oh. actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
dwight Fine.
michael Good. Okay.
michael Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
photographer I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I. D. photos.
michael Well. that's. what, a computer camera, right?
photographer You mean digital?
michael It'll take like two seconds.
photographer 20 bucks.
michael Ugh. All right. Everybody, come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
stanley You gotta be kiddin' me.
michael Come on, everybody.
dwight Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar. andale! Let's go.
photographer One, two, three. smile. Try to smile.
michael We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
photographer Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three. whether you smile or not. One, two, three.
michael Good, let's check that out. Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
photographer That'll be another 20.
michael What?
pam Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
michael You just press the button.
angela What?
jim No, Pam.
pam I am. It's about the Save The Date.
jim Pam, it wasn't her.
pam What?!
jim I'm the one who complained about you.
jim I. I didn't know that toby was gonna write it down. I was just venting.
michael Okay, good. Check that out.
jim You know, it was one day.
michael That's terrible.
jim And I took it right back. It was like.
pam Okay.
phyllis Oh, dear.
michael Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. Okay. we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.
michael It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
michael One, two. Didn't say three, did I?
michael But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
jim Hey, Pam. it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. Female
worker Okay, Jan will see you now.
jim Oh, thanks.
michael And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage
matches sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something toby will never understand.
