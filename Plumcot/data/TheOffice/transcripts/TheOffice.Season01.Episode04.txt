dwight_schrute Michael!?
michael_scott Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
dwight_schrute I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
michael_scott There's no downsizing.
dwight_schrute I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
michael_scott Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
dwight_schrute Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
michael_scott Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
michael_scott But there's no downsizing, so just don't...
dwight_schrute Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
michael_scott Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
michael_scott It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired." "You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. "You're foir-ed." I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But that's unrealistic, so...
dwight_schrute It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
stanley_hudson Why'd you do this?
dwight_schrute I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
michael_scott Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
michael_scott Who is it? Who's the birthday?
pam_beesly Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
michael_scott Next person on the...
pam_beesly Oh.
michael_scott ...calendar.
pam_beesly Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.
michael_scott Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
pam_beesly But it's not until next month.
michael_scott Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
pam_beesly You still want to have a party?
michael_scott Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
michael_scott Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
phyllis_vance Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.
angela_martin What?
phyllis_vance I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
angela_martin No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
phyllis_vance Yeah?
angela_martin What color do you guys think?
phyllis_vance Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...
pam_beesly How about green?
angela_martin I think green is kind of whoreish.
pam_beesly This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
michael_scott These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
michael_scott So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
angela_martin Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...
michael_scott She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...
pam_beesly It is... her birthday.
michael_scott Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
dwight_schrute Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
dwight_schrute Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
jim_halpert Absolutely, I do.
dwight_schrute Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
jim_halpert At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
dwight_schrute Did you get your tickets?
jim_halpert To what?
dwight_schrute The gun show.
jim_halpert And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, here's a way."
dwight_schrute There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
pam_beesly An alliance?
jim_halpert Oh yeah.
pam_beesly What does that even mean?
jim_halpert I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
jim_halpert Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
dwight_schrute Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
dwight_schrute Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
jim_halpert What? No.
dwight_schrute Just now.
jim_halpert What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
dwight_schrute Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
jim_halpert Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
dwight_schrute Mmm hmm.
jim_halpert But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
dwight_schrute Done.
jim_halpert All right.
michael_scott Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael."
dwight_schrute They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
jim_halpert Yeah, what do you think that's about?
dwight_schrute Only one way to find out.
jim_halpert I'm on it.
jim_halpert You are not going to believe this.
dwight_schrute What? I believe it.
jim_halpert Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
dwight_schrute I could tell, from the body language.
jim_halpert Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
kevin_malone Italian.
jim_halpert Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
kevin_malone Yeah.
jim_halpert Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
dwight_schrute Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
jim_halpert Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
dwight_schrute Oh, they're forming an alliance
toby_flenderson I love their sandwiches.
jim_halpert I love their sandwiches too.
kevin_malone Their bread's really good.
jim_halpert Their bread is very good.
dwight_schrute Damn it. God!
jim_halpert OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
dwight_schrute God... Damn it! Why us?
jim_halpert Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
michael_scott Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
michael_scott Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?
oscar_martinez Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
michael_scott Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
oscar_martinez My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... you know... if...
michael_scott What?
oscar_martinez Donate to the charity?
michael_scott Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
oscar_martinez Thank you.
michael_scott No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
oscar_martinez That's... that's... that's very generous.
michael_scott Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...
pam_beesly Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
jim_halpert Sure, what's up?
pam_beesly Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
jim_halpert Oh no?
pam_beesly Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, "These people are my friends." But he's all like, "This is confidential. You can't tell anybody." But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
jim_halpert No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
pam_beesly OK, yeah.
dwight_schrute Jackpot.
jim_halpert That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
michael_scott Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
dwight_schrute Hey, you wanted to see me?
michael_scott Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
dwight_schrute I don't think she'd be missed.
michael_scott There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
dwight_schrute Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
michael_scott I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
dwight_schrute She had a hysterectomy.
michael_scott Which one is that again?
dwight_schrute That's where they remove the uterus.
michael_scott Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
dwight_schrute It could be kind of funny.
michael_scott You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
jim_halpert OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
dwight_schrute Oh my God, we have to be there.
jim_halpert I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
dwight_schrute No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
jim_halpert What? What?
dwight_schrute I know. I know exactly what to do.
jim_halpert Great.
dwight_schrute I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
dwight_schrute This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
jim_halpert Good.
ryan_howard Michael? Are you done yet?
michael_scott Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
jim_halpert Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
dwight_schrute So tape it down.
jim_halpert I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
dwight_schrute Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
jim_halpert Thank you, thank you. OK.
all@ Surprise!
meredith_palmer Oh! Surprise.
angela_martin No, it's ah...
michael_scott It's surprise Meredith. One, two...
all@ Happy birthday to you.
michael_scott Find a key.
all@ Happy birthday...
jim_halpert So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
dwight_schrute No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
jim_halpert Right... That's good.
dwight_schrute Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
all@ ... birthday, dear Meredith Happy birthday to you...
michael_scott And many more!
stanley_hudson Last year, five years ago...
michael_scott You were surprised, weren't you?
meredith_palmer Yes.
michael_scott You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" Good cake. Why don't you have some?
meredith_palmer Uh, I can't. Um...
michael_scott Come on. A little bit.
meredith_palmer I can't eat dairy.
michael_scott Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
meredith_palmer Yeah, it makes me sick.
michael_scott You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.
pam_beesly He's in a box?
jim_halpert Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
pam_beesly Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
dwight_schrute Oh.
michael_scott Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
jim_halpert Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
michael_scott Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
jim_halpert Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
michael_scott Is Oscar around?
michael_scott I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...
oscar_martinez Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
michael_scott I know...
oscar_martinez It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, "However many dollars per mile."
michael_scott Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
oscar_martinez I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
michael_scott No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
oscar_martinez Yeah.
michael_scott How many miles did he do last year?
oscar_martinez Last year, he walked 18 miles.
michael_scott Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
pam_beesly Happy Birthday.
michael_scott Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
meredith_palmer "Happy Bird-day" Um... "Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still."
michael_scott I don't know about that.
meredith_palmer That was Stanley. "Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam."
michael_scott Huh! Thanks, downer.
meredith_palmer This is from Michael. "Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age."
michael_scott Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
meredith_palmer No, I... I get it. It's funny.
michael_scott You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
meredith_palmer You're right. You're right. Yes.
michael_scott Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..."
oscar_martinez How old is she?
michael_scott Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
all@ How old is she?
michael_scott "She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
michael_scott That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
oscar_martinez Uh, nice party Michael.
michael_scott This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that.
angela_martin Phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
phyllis_vance Oh, boy... You...
michael_scott OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.
oscar_martinez Per mile.
michael_scott Per mile, yes.
michael_scott When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
michael_scott A check for the kids, and for the team.
michael_scott I want it to be like... "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous." "Well, guess what, that was Michael Scott." "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because I'm him."
oscar_martinez Thank you, Michael.
michael_scott Come here. Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
toby_flenderson Really? Today?
ryan_howard Yeah.
toby_flenderson Oh, Happy Birthday.
ryan_howard Thanks.
toby_flenderson Yeah, I could say something.
ryan_howard No, don't. Don't do that.
jim_halpert OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
pam_beesly Oh, tell me, tell me.
jim_halpert OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... ... spy on our other branch. No no no.
jim_halpert But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
pam_beesly That's perfect!
jim_halpert If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
roy_anderson What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
jim_halpert No, no, dude, no.
pam_beesly Hey, Hey!
jim_halpert No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
pam_beesly Come on.
jim_halpert God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
pam_beesly It's just office pranks.
jim_halpert It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
roy_anderson An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
dwight_schrute I have absolutely no idea.
roy_anderson Come on.
dwight_schrute Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
dwight_schrute That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
