pam Hey Brian, you got a sec?
brian Yeah, hold on a sec.
pam I feel awful.
brian It's fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you.
erin Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
pam Well, thanks for being a good friend.
brian Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
pam Yeah, mostly.
erin Pam, phone call.
pam Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
brian Will do.
pam Okay. Thank you.
brian Sure.
meredith Hey, boom guy.
brian Oh, hey Meredith.
meredith When are you gonna boom me?
brian Uh, listen, they're cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It's a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna. I, I'll see you later.
meredith Got it.
clark Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
dwight That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
clark Well, uh. see, you raised it.
dwight Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
dwight wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, "Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses. " Wow.
clark You know what, man? I deserve this job.
dwight Mm-hmm.
clark I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond. and under.
dwight You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
dwight clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And trevor – he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants.
clark This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
dwight Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
jim You could've just called that an alliance too, right?
dwight I chose my words very carefully.
jim Things are a little delicate with me and pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse.
clark You interviewing for the sales job too?
rolf No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it.
clark Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, I've been working here 12 weeks. That's a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we've seen.
rolf I'm Rolf. rolf Ahl.
clark rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
rolf Go to hell.
clark There he is.
dwight Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor.
rolf Nice.
dwight rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
pam When are you talking to David Wallace?
jim I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up.
pam Too late. My hopes are up.
jim Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So. problem solved. Thanks, guys.
dwight And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
jim I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.
dwight No doy!
jim I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.
rolf I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds.
dwight No earbuds!
jim I'm sure he's just nervous.
pam It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.
dwight So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.
rolf Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me?
dwight Well, I'm the one offering the job.
rolf What are your credentials?
dwight I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
rolf I think I've heard everything I need to hear.
dwight Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.
rolf Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch.
dwight Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump, " and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
dwight What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?
trevor Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.
dwight Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
trevor Pass. Next one.
dwight All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
trevor No, no and no.
dwight There were only two options.
trevor Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?
dwight This is a bus transfer.
trevor Nothing gets by this guy.
clark Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
jim Sure, yeah, go ahead.
clark Thanks, dude. You—you sure it's okay? ‘Cause you're kinda—
jim Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?
clark Oh, Dove Men.
jim Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so—
clark Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
jim Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
clark Thanks, dude.
jim Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
clark Why?
jim I need you to breathe in my face right now.
clark 
jim What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
clark Wintergreen.
jim I knew it, I knew it.
clark Yeah, good nose.
jim I looked at you coming around, and I said, "Wintergreen. "
dwight I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
dwight Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
clark That's just a classic no-win situation.
dwight Thank you.
clark So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.
dwight Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
clark Yep.
dwight Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond .
clark You know what, Dwight?
dwight And anoth—
clark This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process.
dwight No.
clark Yeah. Star Trek rules.
dwight It does, but still no.
clark Come on, man. I mean, did trevor do that? Did rolf do that?
dwight Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.
stanley This is not natural.
oscar Just – I don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances.
pam Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
darryl They smell so bad.
meredith If I ever get that bad, you'd tell me, right?
kevin Meredith, I tell you all the time.
meredith Walked right into that one.
dwight Next up, my cousin Mose. mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.
dwight What quality would make you a good sales associate?
mose People person.
dwight It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
mose That's right.
dwight You know we live together, right?
mose Yes.
dwight And I've never seen you go to work, ever.
mose Okay.
dwight So why is this on your resume?
clark So how'd you guys hear about the position?
gabor My—my mom.
nate dwight called my house, but he didn't realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can't stay out of her stuff.
zeke Dwight's my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother mose about the job opportunity in the shower.
clark You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
zeke Everyone was in the shower. It's a cow shower, so there's like, a ton of people in there.
clark So you guys all know dwight already?
melvina I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby.
gabor I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up dwight from school.
melvina You went to X-Men school too?
clark X-Men school?
dwight When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out. . push;
gabor Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi's. A lot of telemarketing.
angela I don't want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
stanley I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn't work then. And now look what he's doing to us.
nellie Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.
jim How is it my fault?
nellie Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
jim But it's dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.
oscar Yeah, but Jim, Dwight's a weirdo. We can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
pam Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off. David
wallace Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
jim Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input—
dwight This is dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying. David
wallace Hey, Dwight. It's David.
dwight David. David
wallace jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process.
dwight Really? That's interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
jim I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife— David
wallace Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
jim Oh. Um. David
wallace Yeah.
jim Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.
dwight Sounds fair to me, David. David
wallace And I know we have a call scheduled for later –
jim Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.
dwight No. Why not do it now? David
wallace Yeah. What's up Jim?
jim Uh. Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
dwight I'd love to be in the loop, David. David
wallace It's okay. Go ahead, Jim.
jim There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor – David
wallace Okay. Jim, I'm gonna have to stop you right there.
jim Yes, okay. Bye.
dwight I'd love to invest.
jim No, thanks.
dwight I'd like to give you $100 million.
hide Why you make trees into bushes? You don't make paper from bushes.
pam Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?
hide Thank you.
pam Yeah.
troy Whoops.
zeke It's dense. Like bread.
jim Dwight, you can't just hire someone ‘cause they're your friend.
dwight I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
nellie They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
dwight You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
darryl Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into m*st*rb*t*ng.
wolf Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.
dwight Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
dwight wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ‘em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
dwight Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
wolf Do you want this paper?
dwight I sure do.
wolf It's not very good.
dwight I will pay you whatever it takes.
wolf I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.
dwight No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
wolf Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over.
dwight Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?
wolf I am.
dwight Okay. Good, good, good.
hide I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.
dwight This isn't gonna work out.
hide Thank you.
dwight nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them?
dwight No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.
melvina Do you need to be changed?
dwight I do that myself now.
melvina Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car.
dwight No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
melvina Well, the joke's on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas.
trevor Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we're still gonna be your friend.
wolf Yeah, whether it's me or troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina—
dwight Or none of you
wolf Yeah, you'd bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us.
trevor Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.
dwight I wish I could hire all of you.
zeke I could start Monday.
dwight Psst. jim Jim? Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
jim Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say.
dwight Just act natural.
dwight And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
jim But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.
dwight Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.
jim Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
dwight I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
jim I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
dwight Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
jim Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
dwight Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
jim And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you. Sensei
ira I'm sorry?
dwight What? This is such bullcrap!
jim Well, you know, wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
dwight Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B. C. How could you do this to them?
jim Too much now.
dwight Okay.
nate Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
dwight Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
jim That seems inconsiderate.
rolf No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.
dwight Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
trevor Well, my day's shot.
rolf Yeah, it's that weird hour where it's too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson's.
wolf I got it. Paintball.
dwight Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
trevor And what are we supposed to do until then?
dwight Okay.
wolf Let's just go, you guys.
rolf Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right?
jim All right. I think that went well.
jim So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out—Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
clark What's up good lookin'?
pam Oh, cool. Hey Clark.
jim Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
pam Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
jim Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.
pam Of course.
jim I'll call you when I get there.
pam Okay.
jim All right.
pam Bye.
jim Take care of my wife. I will be back.
dwight They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
clark Hey, Pam, I'm going to the kitchen. You want anything?
pam I'm good.
dwight Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee.
clark Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
dwight 
pam Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
dwight Who, me?
pam Us.
dwight Absolutely, I do.
pam Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that.
dwight Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great.
pam pam &amp;
dwight 
dwight Aah!
clark No!
dwight Welcome to the club, pig!
pam No, Dwight!
dwight Aah!
jim No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
