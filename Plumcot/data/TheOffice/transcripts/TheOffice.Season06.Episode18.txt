jim_halpert Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
orderly_2 Daddy? She's ready to push.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.
jim_halpert Doing great, push again.
rolf Not yet.
jim_halpert No, don't push. Pull. Pull.
orderly_2 Why don't you get more ice chips?
pam_beesly No, Jim, stay!
rolf Okay. Really push this time, Pam.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.
michael_scott That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
andy_bernard Hey, have you guys seen her?
meredith_palmer She hasn't popped yet.
andy_bernard What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.
andy_bernard I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
phyllis_vance This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.
michael_scott I think it's going to be any minute now.
phyllis_vance But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
michael_scott Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
phyllis_vance I have an ice cream cake in the car.
michael_scott Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.
michael_scott Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
pam_beesly This is happening!
michael_scott You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
jim_halpert Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God.
pam_beesly Oh, my God.
michael_scott Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?
rolf Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out.
michael_scott Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
pam_beesly She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?
jim_halpert No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott Guys, guys!
jim_halpert Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
michael_scott Eleven pounds...
jim_halpert She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great.
all@ Yeah!
michael_scott Thank you! Thank you!
oscar_martinez Congratulations. That's great.
helene_beesly Hi there.
jim_halpert Hey, grandma's back.
helene_beesly Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
jim_halpert Great.
pam_beesly Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
helene_beesly Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.
jim_halpert Oh. Let me get it.
jim_halpert I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.
michael_scott Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma.
helene_beesly Hello, Michael.
michael_scott Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.
helene_beesly I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.
pam_beesly Okay.
helene_beesly Love you.
michael_scott Love you, as a friend.
pam_beesly Love you, mom.
michael_scott Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
pam_beesly Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
michael_scott Alright.
pam_beesly Again, no pants.
michael_scott Oh, okay.
jim_halpert Ready?
michael_scott Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.
jim_halpert It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
dwight_schrute Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work .
michael_scott There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.
andy_bernard This man has a gift!
michael_scott Who else here is single?
kelly_kapoor I'm not single. I have a man.
michael_scott I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too.
stanley_hudson Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
michael_scott Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? Who else? Come on! People, I know models!
ryan_howard Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
michael_scott Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.
meredith_palmer You know it. I am never getting married.
meredith_palmer Like Clooney.
michael_scott Andrew, what about you?
andy_bernard Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing.
andy_bernard Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
michael_scott Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
pam_beesly Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
jim_halpert We were just kids. What did we know?
orderly_2 How we doing?
jim_halpert Great.
pam_beesly Good.
orderly_2 Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
pam_beesly Doesn't she sleep here?
orderly_2 She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot.
jim_halpert I think we'll be okay.
orderly_2 Okay, great.
pam_beesly Oh, big yawn.
jim_halpert Ready? One, two, three...
pam_beesly One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down.
jim_halpert I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it.
pam_beesly She's not gonna... Just...
jim_halpert I got it. Alright.
pam_beesly Go.
jim_halpert Nurse!
jim_halpert How you doing?
pam_beesly I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly Doesn't feel right.
jim_halpert Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
pam_beesly How does one do that?
jim_halpert Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that.
pam_beesly Do you want to try it, Jim?
jim_halpert I think you're good. Doing a good job.
orderly_2 Somebody buzzed?
jim_halpert Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.
pam_beesly I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.
orderly_2 Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
pam_beesly Even if she's not getting anything?
orderly_2 Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.
pam_beesly No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.
orderly_2 Oh, good. You know everything.
pam_beesly She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
orderly_2 Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
jim_halpert Alright.
orderly_2 Alright.
jim_halpert It's going to be alright.
pam_beesly Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
jim_halpert Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good.
erin_hannon You wanted to see me?
michael_scott What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
erin_hannon Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?
kevin_malone Ta-da!
michael_scott I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
kevin_malone Yes!
erin_hannon I don't know what to say.
kevin_malone Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.
michael_scott Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?
kevin_malone Erin, would you have lunch with me?
erin_hannon Okay.
michael_scott Good!
kevin_malone Yes!
erin_hannon Michael, could I talk to you privately?
michael_scott Sure. Kevin, please leave.
kevin_malone Bye.
michael_scott Bye.
erin_hannon I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy.
michael_scott Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
erin_hannon I'm sure he'll be fine.
michael_scott I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.
erin_hannon Really?
michael_scott No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
erin_hannon I don't want anyone to die.
michael_scott Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.
kevin_malone Hi.
erin_hannon Hi.
kevin_malone She touched my shoulder.
orderly_2 Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.
jim_halpert Oh, hi.
cathy Hi.
dale Hi, so sorry.
jim_halpert Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
pam_beesly I know.
jim_halpert You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.
erin_hannon Did you grow up around here?
kevin_malone No.
erin_hannon So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
kevin_malone Yes.
andy_bernard Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guy's going to fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted." ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous.
hospital_employee employee Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?
pam_beesly Yes?
hospital_employee employee Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
pam_beesly Um, yeah, that would be great.
jim_halpert Yup. Really great. When's she available?
clark Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with.
pam_beesly So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
clark I'll get that for you.
pam_beesly Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything.
clark Okay. Let me feel here.
pam_beesly Okay.
clark Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
pam_beesly Okay.
clark When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt?
pam_beesly No, I mean, it feels... pressure.
clark Okay.
jim_halpert Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
pam_beesly No. It just feels like pressure.
clark Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that?
jim_halpert Yup.
clark Stimulate it.
jim_halpert Yeah.
clark Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
jim_halpert Perfect.
clark And you can just... The baby should grab on to that.
jim_halpert I think she will.
pam_beesly Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if...
jim_halpert We'll figure it out.
clark It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.
pam_beesly Okay. Aw, thank you.
clark Yes, congratulations.
jim_halpert Thank you.
clark Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Please do.
pam_beesly Oh, shoot.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Shoot, she fell off.
jim_halpert Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
pam_beesly Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
jim_halpert No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.
pam_beesly Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
jim_halpert Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
dwight_schrute Hey, what's up, kid?
angela_martin Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
dwight_schrute Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
angela_martin I look forward to it.
dwight_schrute Very well.
angela_martin Goodbye.
pam_beesly Jim, Jim, get her.
jim_halpert Hmm?
pam_beesly Get the baby. Get her. Come on.
jim_halpert Okay. Sshh. I know.
pam_beesly I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched.
jim_halpert That's amazing.
pam_beesly Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the "C thing."
jim_halpert That's awesome.
pam_beesly Aw, we're doing it.
jim_halpert that's great.
pam_beesly We're really parents now.
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
michael_scott Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you.
erin_hannon Hey.
kevin_malone Hi.
erin_hannon I have really enjoyed our time together.
kevin_malone Yeah, me too.
erin_hannon I want to continue working on our friendship.
kevin_malone Really, really fun.
erin_hannon Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
kevin_malone Yeah, me too.
erin_hannon And, you're my friend.
kevin_malone Yeah.
erin_hannon And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe...
kevin_malone Yeah.
michael_scott Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
kevin_malone You said she liked me.
michael_scott Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
kevin_malone I've dumped better than Erin.
michael_scott No.
kevin_malone Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
michael_scott Lynn was as hot as Erin.
kevin_malone Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
michael_scott This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?
andy_bernard Ow.
michael_scott Kev... Nice. Going.
erin_hannon Well...
isabel_poreba Knock knock.
pam_beesly Oh, hey, Isabelle.
jim_halpert Hey.
isabel_poreba Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her?
pam_beesly Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.
jim_halpert Okay, okay.
pam_beesly Oh, my gosh.
cathy Oh,has she been fussing long?
pam_beesly No, not at all.
jim_halpert Perfect.
cathy I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry...
orderly_2 How's it going?
pam_beesly Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
jim_halpert Ha ha ha.
orderly_2 Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home?
jim_halpert We definitely are. At 3 00, right? You said we could stay until 3 00?
orderly_2 Yeah, you can. It's 2 35.
jim_halpert Half hour.
orderly_2 Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat?
jim_halpert Yes, car seat's right there.
orderly_2 That bottom part needs to go in the car.
jim_halpert Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
orderly_2 Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.
jim_halpert Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me.
isabel_poreba Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here?
dwight_schrute Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
isabel_poreba Wow, ha. New cabinets.
dwight_schrute Yup.
isabel_poreba All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge?
dwight_schrute Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this.
isabel_poreba Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it.
dwight_schrute Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun.
isabel_poreba Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.
dwight_schrute Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha.
isabel_poreba Yeah...
dwight_schrute Alright. I'll call you, kid.
isabel_poreba Do that.
jim_halpert Are you really sure we should be leaving?
hospital_employee employee Yeah.
jim_halpert But you hear the baby crying, right?
hospital_employee employee Mm-hmm... Where's your car?
jim_halpert Uh, it's in the lot.
hospital_employee employee Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.
jim_halpert Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
pam_beesly Okay, please hurry.
andy_bernard Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
erin_hannon Okay, good.
andy_bernard The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me?" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
erin_hannon It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
andy_bernard Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
erin_hannon You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.
andy_bernard Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax.
erin_hannon You read the fax.
andy_bernard I'm... I'm asking you out.
erin_hannon Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
andy_bernard So, it's a date.
erin_hannon Yes. Do you have a day in mind?
andy_bernard Yeah, what day? What day?
erin_hannon Everyday is fine. Or...
andy_bernard Well, that, what's that one?
erin_hannon Thursday?
andy_bernard Okay. Let's do it.
erin_hannon Okay.
hospital_employee employee Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, sorry.
hospital_employee employee Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.
pam_beesly Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.
jim_halpert Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.
pam_beesly Hi. We did it.
jim_halpert You used my move, didn't you?
pam_beesly I used a variation of your move.
michael_scott There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick...
dwight_schrute Two forms of ID, please.
angela_martin And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it?
dwight_schrute Nothing.
angela_martin Alright. How would you like to celebrate?
dwight_schrute Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.
