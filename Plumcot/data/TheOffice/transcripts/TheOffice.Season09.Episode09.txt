jim_halpert I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
pam_beesly I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
jim_halpert Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
jim_halpert I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5 00, check into a hotel at about 6 00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
dwight_schrute Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
jim_halpert So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"?
dwight_schrute Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
erin_hannon Oh...Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
angela_martin No.
nellie_bertram Is It?
erin_hannon I mean, it says "X-Mas party," but I think we all know what that's code for.
kevin_malone So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
angela_martin Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
kevin_malone Well, you are the one in charge of it.
angela_martin Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
oscar_martinez Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
oscar_martinez I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
phyllis_vance I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
meredith_palmer We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
nellie_bertram Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
kevin_malone Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
dwight_schrute What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
jim_halpert Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
kevin_malone No.
angela_martin No!
jim_halpert Done, right?
angela_martin No.
stanley_hudson No. I want Tropical Christmas.
meredith_palmer Topless Christmas.
creed_bratton Tapas swiss miss.
creed_bratton Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
dwight_schrute Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
phyllis_vance We already said no.
angela_martin No, no, no.
nellie_bertram Too weird.
dwight_schrute This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
jim_halpert I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
angela_martin Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
pam_beesly I'm on it.
jim_halpert Right.
pete_miller I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
erin_hannon Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
pete_miller Die hard reference.
erin_hannon I haven't seen it.
pete_miller You haven't seen die hard?
erin_hannon Mm-Mmm.
pete_miller Why haven't you seen die hard?
erin_hannon I don't know, I just haven't.
kevin_malone Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
erin_hannon No.
kevin_malone "now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho."
pete_miller "Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs."
erin_hannon None of this makes any sense to me!
kevin_malone Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, "Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--"
pete_miller Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
kevin_malone Yes, you are right. Forgive me.
pete_miller Oh, that's okay, bud.
kevin_malone Nope.
pete_miller Common mistake.
kevin_malone No, it's not.
erin_hannon Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
pete_miller My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
erin_hannon Okay, let's hear it.
pete_miller Hear what?
erin_hannon Die hard. Every line. Go.
pete_miller "You don't like flying, do you?"
erin_hannon Don't change the subject.
pete_miller No, that's the--
erin_hannon Movie is starting.
jim_halpert We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
stanley_hudson I love Philly. Dirty town.
darryl_philbin Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
jim_halpert Whoo!
darryl_philbin So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
jim_halpert Yeah, I think so.
darryl_philbin Think that through for a sec.
darryl_philbin Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
darryl_philbin What else could you possibly be forgetting?
jim_halpert Uh--
darryl_philbin Things? People?
toby_flenderson You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a.k.a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison for something he may not have done.
nellie_bertram I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who?
toby_flenderson The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
nellie_bertram Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
toby_flenderson I--I could--I could talk about it.
stanley_hudson See you next Christmas.
toby_flenderson I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
pam_beesly We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great...I think we all know what that would mean to us.
phyllis_vance Let's do it!
pam_beesly Yes! Phyllis!
angela_martin No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
pam_beesly What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
angela_martin Please just take my name off of everything.
oscar_martinez Just take her name off of everything.
pam_beesly The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
dwight_schrute Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
pam_beesly Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
dwight_schrute Uh-huh.
pam_beesly And that is...
dwight_schrute Uh, Oh.
pam_beesly That there are no rules.
dwight_schrute You have never been cooler.
jim_halpert Best Christmas ever.
pam_beesly You're welcome.
jim_halpert Thank you.
dwight_schrute And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
meredith_palmer Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
dwight_schrute That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
pam_beesly What is it? Don't touch it.
dwight_schrute Somebody's found the hog maw.
pam_beesly Oh!
dwight_schrute What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
stanley_hudson Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
dwight_schrute It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
jim_halpert Can't wait.
meredith_palmer Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
dwight_schrute This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
oscar_martinez How would anyone even know--
dwight_schrute Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
jim_halpert I don't know. Is it what you expected?
pam_beesly I feel like --Dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
jim_halpert So happy right now.
dwight_schrute Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
kevin_malone I wish my car had a bathroom.
pete_miller "Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--"
erin_hannon Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
pete_miller That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
erin_hannon I don't know. This looks pretty legit. Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
erin_hannon "What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates."
pete_miller Hey. Everything okay?
erin_hannon So what comes next?
pete_miller Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, "After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--"
erin_hannon We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
pete_miller Or we can just sit and talk, though.
erin_hannon No. No more talking. It's movie time.
pete_miller I mean, are you sure...Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
erin_hannon Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
pete_miller Okay.
toby_flenderson Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight.
kevin_malone I love this hog mama.
phyllis_vance Dwight said it's "Hog maw."
kevin_malone What is maw?!
phyllis_vance It's the lining of the stomach of--
dwight_schrute Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
jim_halpert Yes, he is finally nigh.
dwight_schrute I am nigh!
dwight_schrute Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
dwight_schrute Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! Ohh...Too much strudel.
jim_halpert So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
dwight_schrute No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
jim_halpert Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
pam_beesly And the fear.
dwight_schrute Yes, exactly!
phyllis_vance Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
dwight_schrute No.
oscar_martinez This is a real thing. "Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany."
angela_martin Huh.
pam_beesly Wow.
dwight_schrute Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
oscar_martinez "His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface."
stanley_hudson Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
dwight_schrute Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.
pete_miller Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
erin_hannon Mm.
darryl_philbin Jim, that guy. You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? It's awful.
dwight_schrute Take a bowl and pass it down.
phyllis_vance Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
dwight_schrute No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
jim_halpert Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
dwight_schrute No, impish or admirable.
jim_halpert Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
dwight_schrute I decided earlier.
jim_halpert Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
dwight_schrute Of course I checked it.
jim_halpert But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
dwight_schrute I checked it more than once.
jim_halpert Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
dwight_schrute Impish or admirable.
jim_halpert Damn.
dwight_schrute Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. There you are.
phyllis_vance Oh. What are these?
dwight_schrute It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
phyllis_vance I'd rather have the bowl.
dwight_schrute You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year ...as impish!
oscar_martinez Ow! You hit people with that thing?
dwight_schrute No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder
jim_halpert Ooh.
pam_beesly Mouse trap.
dwight_schrute In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
jim_halpert Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
dwight_schrute Stop giggling.
pam_beesly Oh, really? Already?
jim_halpert Yeah, it's all right.
dwight_schrute It's a punishment. Hey, where are you going?
jim_halpert I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
dwight_schrute But you work tomorrow.
jim_halpert Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
dwight_schrute But we were gonna break the pig rib.
jim_halpert Ooh.
dwight_schrute Remember?
jim_halpert That's right.
dwight_schrute No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
jim_halpert Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
dwight_schrute Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
jim_halpert You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
dwight_schrute Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as impish.
jim_halpert Ooh! Are you nuts?
dwight_schrute I judge you impish!
jim_halpert Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
dwight_schrute They're not abandoning the party.
jim_halpert Just--Just--Hey!
jim_halpert That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
dwight_schrute Impish!
jim_halpert Aah! Ow!
meredith_palmer Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too.
jim_halpert Oh...what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. One second. Oh...
pam_beesly Well...this is it.
jim_halpert I'm probably never gonna see you again.
pam_beesly Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.
jim_halpert Okay, sorry, sorry.
pam_beesly I can't believe this is actually happening.
jim_halpert Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
pam_beesly Okay. Good luck. You're gonna be great.
jim_halpert I'll call you when I get in.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert All right.
pam_beesly Love you.
jim_halpert Love you.
pam_beesly What's going on?
dwight_schrute Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight!
phyllis_vance We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
angela_martin Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
nellie_bertram Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
toby_flenderson Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
darryl_philbin Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
darryl_philbin Boo!
pam_beesly For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
dwight_schrute Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
pam_beesly I don't think anyone thought that.
dwight_schrute Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
pam_beesly Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
dwight_schrute I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
pam_beesly Zero.
dwight_schrute Damn It!
darryl_philbin I'm gonna tell Jim to go himself.
erin_hannon Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
pete_miller Yeah. Definitely. Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
erin_hannon I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
pete_miller Oh, yeah, of course. I know.
erin_hannon But you can leave your arm.
pam_beesly Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
dwight_schrute No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
jim_halpert Yep, I did say that.
pam_beesly Jim!
jim_halpert What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
pam_beesly Oh--Oh my god!
jim_halpert What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
dwight_schrute Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash!
pam_beesly What happened? Did you miss your bus?
jim_halpert No. I just missed my wife.
dwight_schrute I found it!
jim_halpert And I found out that there's a bus at 5 00 a.m.
dwight_schrute Oh! Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
darryl_philbin Back for more, huh?
jim_halpert Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
darryl_philbin You!
jim_halpert Oh, hey, man. Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
darryl_philbin That's great.
jim_halpert Right?
darryl_philbin Thanks, man.
jim_halpert Hey, of course.
darryl_philbin I shall come by at your convenience.
jim_halpert Thank you, sir.
darryl_philbin Whoo!
jim_halpert Go get 'em.
darryl_philbin Oh! Whoa!
dwight_schrute Very impish.
toby_flenderson Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
nellie_bertram Shh.
toby_flenderson What? I was just explaining--
nellie_bertram Shh.
toby_flenderson Why wouldn't it--
nellie_bertram Shh.
toby_flenderson But why?
nellie_bertram No...more...talking.
toby_flenderson Are you gonna kiss me?
nellie_bertram Yes.
