michael_scott Look at that.
oscar_martinez Huh?
michael_scott Nice!
oscar_martinez I love cycling. Andy, I feel like a tourist in my own city. I literally can't wait to wake up every morning.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott She is a beaut!
dwight_schrute Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
oscar_martinez Yes, it is.
michael_scott Oh, look at that. Smooth roll.
oscar_martinez Yeah.
kevin_malone You got it! Lance Armstrong's Bike!
oscar_martinez Yes.
meredith_palmer His ass was on that seat? All right!
kevin_malone Nice.
oscar_martinez No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
kelly_kapoor I'm on Sheryl Crow's side in that whole thing, so I feel really weird right now.
pam_beesly Michael!
michael_scott Oh, god!
oscar_martinez Oh...
michael_scott Yes, I can ride a bike. I take spinning classes three times a month. I think I know how to ride a bike.
jim_halpert Are you sure you once knew how to do this?
michael_scott I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you. Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
all@ Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
dwight_schrute Yeah!
pam_beesly Come on, Michael! Yeah!
jim_halpert Just steer more now.
michael_scott Oh, my god!
pam_beesly Not the car!
jim_halpert No! No!
michael_scott Ow! You never forget. Whoo!
dwight_schrute How do I look?
jim_halpert Amazing. How do I look?
dwight_schrute Normal. Ugly.
jim_halpert Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
dwight_schrute Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
dwight_schrute We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
jim_halpert He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
dwight_schrute Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
jim_halpert I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
dwight_schrute And who is this "the" Steve Nash?
jim_halpert Phoenix Sun's point guard?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert No? Nothin'?
dwight_schrute No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
jim_halpert Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
andy_bernard Whoa. Libby Dirketts got married. Big Red mazel tov to the Libster. Ooh, says here Dan Becker fell off the side of Kilimanjaro in a climbing accident. It appears Dan's Sherpa survived to tell the tale-Oh, my God!
phyllis_vance What? Is Dan okay?
andy_bernard No, he died. It's Broccoli Rob. You know this guy; I showed you his picture on Facebook.
phyllis_vance Yes.
andy_bernard "Some Vermont-based alums can hear 'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96, in the state milk lobby's new milk awareness song, 'Calci-YUM!', featuring Phish's Trey Anastasio. Says Broccoli, 'Trey and I had a ton of fun in the studio, and I think you can hear it in the song.'"
phyllis_vance Oh, that's great news for your friend.
andy_bernard Yeah, yeah, it's great...
phyllis_vance You know, I forget about milk. This is a terrific reminder.
andy_bernard I was the artsy, musical one. In Here Comes Treble I had four solos, Broccoli rob had three. Right? Uhh.
dwight_schrute Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
jim_halpert Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...
dwight_schrute Crap.
dwight_schrute Danny Cordray is the worst.
jim_halpert Well, by worst, you mean the best.
dwight_schrute The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
jim_halpert So, the situation is the worst.
dwight_schrute Also, he slept with Pam.
jim_halpert No, he didn't.
jim_halpert Tell 'em.
pam_beesly Nothing happened. We went on a couple of dates. He never called me again.
jim_halpert What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
pam_beesly That's fizzling. I mean, someone has to start the fizzle.
jim_halpert Yeah, I thought you started it.
pam_beesly No, I liked him. For a couple of days. Four years ago. You know I have a kid with you, right?
jim_halpert Ahhh.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
jim_halpert Okay, great-
dwight_schrute Watch this.
jim_halpert -I'm just gonna watch.
dwight_schrute So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest pen1s I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. That's why I brought you to the pen1s Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!
danny_cordray Hey, Dwight. Good to see you. Jim, hey.
jim_halpert How are ya?
danny_cordray Good to see you too.
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
danny_cordray Oh, I'm just here for the coffee.
dwight_schrute Like hell you are.
jim_halpert Dwight!
dwight_schrute He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
michael_scott Brainstorming session is now open. Anyone has an idea- Hold on. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?
jim_halpert Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
michael_scott Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
angela_martin What?
oscar_martinez You are busy! We're in a meeting!
michael_scott It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
jim_halpert Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
michael_scott You need the big guns, yes?
jim_halpert Yes.
dwight_schrute What'd he say? What did he say?
jim_halpert The big gun thing. Stop!
michael_scott I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight. Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
pam_beesly You don't look reluctant, Michael. You look really eager.
michael_scott No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
pam_beesly You don't?
michael_scott No! Okay. All right.
andy_bernard Knockity-knock, don't knock back. Just kidding you can knock; it's your office. Do you have a minute?
darryl_philbin I'm very busy with time-sensitive work.
andy_bernard Not to go all Sherlock Holmes on you, but I can tell by the reflection in your glasses that you're entering points into Weight Watchers dot com.
darryl_philbin If you don't enter them immediately, you forget. What?
andy_bernard I'm starting a band and I need you on keyboards.
darryl_philbin Nah. I play for pleasure.
andy_bernard This is for pleasure.
darryl_philbin I wouldn't enjoy that.
andy_bernard I'm willing to pay you.
darryl_philbin Oh, yeah?
andy_bernard Yeah.
darryl_philbin How much?
andy_bernard Sixty bucks a session.
darryl_philbin That's crazy money. I'll take forty.
andy_bernard Yes!
dwight_schrute There he is.
michael_scott Oh, no, that's a male model.
jim_halpert No, that's him.
michael_scott That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
danny_cordray Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.
michael_scott Nice to meet you.
danny_cordray Three of you guys for one sale.
michael_scott Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
danny_cordray Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
michael_scott All right.
danny_cordray It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
michael_scott Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
kim He's ready for you.
michael_scott Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--
jim_halpert Nope, not doing that.
dwight_schrute I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
michael_scott Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
jim_halpert Showtime!
michael_scott It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
michael_scott When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-
chief_buyer_steve_nash Michael, I appreciate everything that Dunder-Mifflin has done for this company.
michael_scott You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.
chief_buyer_steve_nash That's very generous, but-
michael_scott And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
dwight_schrute He's not kidding.
michael_scott Shake it, shake it!
chief_buyer_steve_nash Michael, I'm going with Danny.
dwight_schrute Oh.
chief_buyer_steve_nash Thanks for coming in.
michael_scott Okay. Thank you.
chief_buyer_steve_nash Thank you.
michael_scott Thanks, Steve.
dwight_schrute Jim talked too much.
jim_halpert No, I didn't.
dwight_schrute Yes, you did.
michael_scott Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?
michael_scott How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.
michael_scott You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?
stanley_hudson We sell better?
michael_scott Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
stanley_hudson I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
michael_scott Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
stanley_hudson Why do you always assume I have diabetes?
michael_scott I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
phyllis_vance I could try to seduce him.
michael_scott Oh, my god!
dwight_schrute I know how we can learn his tricks.
dwight_schrute What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
jim_halpert Is that your office?
dwight_schrute Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
phyllis_vance Uh...
stanley_hudson I'm outta here.
phyllis_vance This is weird.
michael_scott You know what this is? This is a stinger.
jim_halpert A what?
michael_scott Like the movie.
jim_halpert I think you mean The Sting.
michael_scott Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.
jim_halpert Nope. Different movie.
dwight_schrute The Sting. The Sting.
erin_hannon Your two o'clock.
meredith_palmer Thanks, hun.
jim_halpert Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.
danny_cordray Danny Cordray. It's great to meet you.
meredith_palmer Meredith Van Helsing. Pleased to meet you.
jim_halpert Meredith Van Helsing?
dwight_schrute Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
jim_halpert Okay. But what is he more famous for?
michael_scott Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
jim_halpert You know this isn't real TV, right?
michael_scott Yes.
darryl_philbin and Andy Please Mr. President, if you wanna give hope a whirl, bring our troops home safe and sound, says this little girl.
andy_bernard Please Mr. President-
darryl_philbin One second, one second, one second. So, this song is from the point of view of a little girl?
andy_bernard Yeah.
darryl_philbin But you're singing it.
andy_bernard Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.
darryl_philbin No, that's not a good idea. I don't see that as a very good song.
andy_bernard Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
darryl_philbin Oh, I never sing with soul.
andy_bernard That's a lie.
kevin_malone I could sing it.
andy_bernard I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.
kevin_malone But my voice is unique. Like Bob Dylan.
andy_bernard Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-
danny_cordray I'm gonna take off my coat, if you don't mind. It's a bit warm in here.
meredith_palmer Hel-lo!
michael_scott Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
dwight_schrute People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
michael_scott Testify.
jim_halpert Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
michael_scott Yeah, he is that good-looking.
dwight_schrute He's very, very handsome.
michael_scott Okay.
meredith_palmer That's a great set of shoulder's you got there. What is that...Genetics? Creatine? Sorry. Yeah?
michael_scott Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
meredith_palmer I'm sorry. You're here to sell me some paper.
danny_cordray Well, actually, uh... no, Miss Van Helsing, that's not why I'm here. I'm here to meet you, see if we'd be a, you know, good fit.
meredith_palmer What do you mean?
michael_scott Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
andy_bernard Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?
oscar_martinez It's pandering. And it makes me think you think I'm stupid.
andy_bernard But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?
pam_beesly Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.
andy_bernard I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.
ryan_howard I-I don't think they usually...skate to such...bad songs.
andy_bernard Rude. And not helpful.
creed_bratton Well, I really, really, really liked it.
andy_bernard Well, that...really bums me out.
creed_bratton You're welcome.
danny_cordray We should think of this as a first date. And I think it's going very well, how 'bout you?
meredith_palmer Real well. Uh...feels more like a third date to me.
danny_cordray Ha ha, okay, there you go!
michael_scott Stay-
meredith_palmer Shut up and let me do this! You know, what is with this desk keeping us so far apart?
danny_cordray I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
dwight_schrute Oh...
danny_cordray Well, we'll get this...
michael_scott Oh!
dwight_schrute Oh, man!
meredith_palmer So, what's your drink? You a vodka man? Me too.
jim_halpert We gotta get someone else in there right now.
jim_halpert You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-
oscar_martinez That sounds fake.
jim_halpert What do you mean?
dwight_schrute I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
jim_halpert Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
oscar_martinez Okay.
jim_halpert So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
oscar_martinez All right. I can do that. Then what?
dwight_schrute Then make him pitch to you.
jim_halpert Yes.
dwight_schrute We gotta see what he's got.
jim_halpert Exactly. You can do this.
dwight_schrute Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
jim_halpert Stop it! It's gonna be great.
oscar_martinez Okay.
jim_halpert And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
oscar_martinez Meredith, I-
meredith_palmer Oh, Manuel! This is Manuel, my cleaning man. He doesn't speak any English.
danny_cordray Hola. Que tal?
oscar_martinez Como estas, senor?
meredith_palmer Uh, Manuel, cleano el window.
jim_halpert Who else we got?
dwight_schrute Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
ryan_howard Okay. Stark Industries isn't real. I run Google. Larry and Sergey brought me in-
jim_halpert Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
michael_scott Don't let us down.
ryan_howard Will do. Won't do.
danny_cordray Yeah, sure.
meredith_palmer You smell like a Scorpio. This is...Esteban...another cleaning man. He doesn't speak English either. Esteban, el flooro.
danny_cordray You know what? I may have parked my car in a compact space, and I hate when I see others do that, so-
meredith_palmer Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
michael_scott No, no, no....
jim_halpert No, no, no, no...
michael_scott I'm goin 'in!
dwight_schrute Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
michael_scott Stop, stop! Oh, my god! Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
danny_cordray Michael Scott.
michael_scott I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
meredith_palmer Please to meet you-
michael_scott Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
danny_cordray Hmm.
michael_scott I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
danny_cordray But from where?
michael_scott A surveillance room next to this one.
danny_cordray Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
michael_scott Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
danny_cordray Or...crazy.
michael_scott Well-
danny_cordray I'm gonna go.
michael_scott Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
dwight_schrute No!
jim_halpert No, no, no, no.
danny_cordray Oh, well then, yeah. All right. Hey! Good luck, guys. Seems like you got a great operation here.
michael_scott No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
danny_cordray What do you mean, my tricks? There's no tricks, man. I'm just a good salesman. You wanna copy that? You can't copy that!
michael_scott You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
danny_cordray Sure. You seem like a fun, professional guy.
michael_scott So, you will?
danny_cordray No!
michael_scott Hold it, hold it. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
danny_cordray Get out of my way.
michael_scott Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
danny_cordray I swear to God, I'm gonna hit you. I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I'm not-it's just I'm very upset right now.
michael_scott I know, I know.
danny_cordray I'm very upset!
michael_scott Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
danny_cordray More freedom.
michael_scott I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
michael_scott Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
kelly_kapoor me!
michael_scott O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
kelly_kapoor Josh Duhamel.
angela_martin Yeah, I can see that.
michael_scott No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
kevin_malone He's like a better-looking Andy.
andy_bernard Thanks, Kevin.
michael_scott No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
oscar_martinez It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
dwight_schrute Michael?
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Can I talk to you about something?
michael_scott No, you may not.
dwight_schrute It's about this very announcement you just made.
michael_scott I said no.
dwight_schrute Michael-
michael_scott We're not-
jim_halpert Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
michael_scott Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. Don't leave. Don't let him.
erin_hannon Gotcha.
jim_halpert You hired him?
michael_scott Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
all@ Stay the same.
michael_scott Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
phyllis_vance It's not gonna get better; he's gonna steal all of our clients.
michael_scott No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.
dwight_schrute Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
michael_scott He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
stanley_hudson Hmpf!
dwight_schrute Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
michael_scott Good-bye!
darryl_philbin Song's about truth.
kevin_malone Yeah.
darryl_philbin What's something you really care about?
andy_bernard Reverse snobbery.
darryl_philbin More universal.
andy_bernard Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.
darryl_philbin Couldn't get outta bed today. Wish the alarm clock would go away.
kevin_malone Oh, nice!
andy_bernard Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!
darryl_philbin Go ahead.
andy_bernard Which me am I gonna be today?
darryl_philbin Which me am I gonna be today?
andy_bernard I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?
kevin_malone Or the me that stinks.
andy_bernard Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?
darryl_philbin Oh, don't worry about it.
andy_bernard Wait. Seriously?
darryl_philbin Yeah.
andy_bernard So we're just, like, jamming as friends?
darryl_philbin One, two, three, hit it.
andy_bernard Closet full of mes-
danny_cordray Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
jim_halpert Did ya?
danny_cordray Yeah. Way ,way, way back.
jim_halpert I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
danny_cordray Oh. She was not into me.
jim_halpert Oh.
danny_cordray Obviously. I don't even think she called me back.
dwight_schrute You snubbed her.
jim_halpert Dwight, please.
dwight_schrute Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
danny_cordray Okay...that's different.
dwight_schrute Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. So...you're gonna be workin' here?
danny_cordray Uh...I mean-yeah.
dwight_schrute Welcome aboard.
danny_cordray Thank you.
jim_halpert Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
dwight_schrute It's after 5 00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home.
danny_cordray Oh.
dwight_schrute Pleasure.
danny_cordray Thanks.
michael_scott This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.
kevin_malone Sun's in her eyes, tongue full of flies. Would you like to share my paaaaaaad?
all@ Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love. Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love and I gave her the croak that meant I love you.
darryl_philbin I'll be your croak monsieur.
andy_bernard I'll be your croak madame.
kevin_malone Your mama mighta said that bullfrogs are dogs, but I'm here to tell you that I am a frog! Come and sit on my log, you little pollywog.
darryl_philbin I find you absolutely ribbiting!
all@ Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
andy_bernard Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
kevin_malone Croak!
andy_bernard Ribbit!
darryl_philbin Scoopity-splash!
kevin_malone Nice.
