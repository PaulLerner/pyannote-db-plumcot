pam_beesly W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
jim_halpert So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
pam_beesly Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
jim_halpert Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
pam_beesly Nature.
oscar_martinez Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
andy_bernard I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
kevin_malone I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
pam_beesly Some of us like the walk more than others.
kevin_malone Hurts like hell.
pam_beesly Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
michael_scott Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
pam_beesly But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
pam_beesly Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. I really want it.
michael_scott Have you ever seen this woman?
pam_beesly Her?
michael_scott Hmm...
pam_beesly The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
michael_scott Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
pam_beesly Or in a great chair.
michael_scott Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
pam_beesly I definitely remember your dinner party.
michael_scott I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
pam_beesly Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
michael_scott What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
michael_scott Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85.
creed_bratton Yo, is this his new chair?
pam_beesly No, he hasn't picked one yet.
creed_bratton Daat!
creed_bratton When Pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
michael_scott I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
andy_bernard I left my cell phone in my car.
phyllis_vance Call us when you get there so we know you're OK.
michael_scott Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
kevin_malone If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
michael_scott I thought that you were engaged?
kevin_malone Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
michael_scott Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
kevin_malone Not anymore.
michael_scott Oh...
kevin_malone It's a bitter situation.
michael_scott Yeah... ugh. She's... you don't deserve her. Alright.
michael_scott Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...
phyllis_vance Michael?
michael_scott What?
phyllis_vance I have a friend who's single.
michael_scott Oh.
phyllis_vance Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
michael_scott Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
phyllis_vance Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
michael_scott Oooo. Catcher or in field?
phyllis_vance Umm I don't know Michael.
michael_scott Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
phyllis_vance What are you asking?
michael_scott I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
phyllis_vance No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
michael_scott Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
michael_scott What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
michael_scott Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
angela_martin I don't think that this is---
michael_scott Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
dwight_schrute Write legibly people.
andy_bernard Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
michael_scott Hmm..
andy_bernard It's like a ten minute walk.
kevin_malone No, thirty.
michael_scott Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. OK, yes that would be bad.
kevin_malone Yes.
andy_bernard Yes.
michael_scott That would be bad.
andy_bernard OK.
kevin_malone Nice.
andy_bernard ...So help us out.
michael_scott Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
kevin_malone Michael, please he--
michael_scott What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
andy_bernard We won't let you down.
michael_scott Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
stanley_hudson There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
phyllis_vance Well, I'm setting Michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
pam_beesly Who are you putting down?
jim_halpert Oh, you don't know her.
pam_beesly Who is it?
jim_halpert Your mom.
pam_beesly Yeah, whatever. Give it to me. Give it to me.
michael_scott Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try.
wendys_employee operator Wendy's.
michael_scott Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.
wendys_employee operator This isn't Wendy.
michael_scott Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?
wendys_employee operator Dude, this is a Wendy's restaurant.
michael_scott Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
wendys_employee operator You have to come to the restaurant to order food.
michael_scott Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
wendys_employee operator It's ready now.
michael_scott Well put it aside. Umm... yeah.
dwight_schrute OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
michael_scott Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
dwight_schrute I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
michael_scott That sounds good. Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
dwight_schrute That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
dwight_schrute The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
michael_scott She's dead? She's so young.
dwight_schrute She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
michael_scott Oh, God. Oh...
dwight_schrute Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. Here we go. Yeah.
jim_halpert Michael, you didn't even know her.
michael_scott Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
dwight_schrute Jim, how dare you.
michael_scott Please, not at a time like this.
pam_beesly OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.
michael_scott Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
pam_beesly No, I mean it. She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along.
michael_scott I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?
pam_beesly I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.
michael_scott No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.
kevin_malone We need to assemble the five families.
michael_scott No, not the five families.
kevin_malone We have to.
kevin_malone The five families are the five companies of Scranton Business Park. The bosses rarely meet. There's Michael Scott, Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin. Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. Paul Faust of Disaster Kits Limited. They call him "Cool Guy Paul." W.B. Jones of W.B. Jones Heating and Air. Grade A Bad Ass. And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Dye. Bill Cress is super old and really mean.
michael_scott Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.
kevin_malone I'm calling the meeting anyway.
michael_scott Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette . Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady.
margaret Michael?
michael_scott Ugh.
margaret Are you Michael Scott?
michael_scott Is who a Michael what?
margaret Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm supposed to be meeting someone named Michael.
michael_scott Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...
Coffee#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode10 shop worker Michael? Michael? Large hot chocolate with caramel and a shot of peppermint.
michael_scott So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...
margaret You're asking what I do with the checks that people write to me?
michael_scott Just making conversation.
michael_scott Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?
margaret I don't know.
michael_scott You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. Look at that.
margaret She's beautiful.
michael_scott Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.
jan_levinson Michael? Hello? Michael?
margaret I'm gonna head out.
michael_scott Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
margaret That's incredibly rude.
michael_scott Now you ruined it.
bob_vance Vance Where's Scott?
andy_bernard Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.
wb_jones Jones Let's just meet back in an hour.
andy_bernard Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.
kevin_malone I... have... things...
wb_jones Jones Alright, what do you want?
andy_bernard Well first of all, I'd just like to say what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.
wb_jones Jones You have about ten seconds---
kevin_malone We want our parking spaces back!
paul_faust Faust Whose parking spaces?
kevin_malone W.B. Jones' construction guys park in our parking spaces every morning and some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office. And some people sweat too much for comfort and---
bill_kress Cress Ohh... God...
paul_faust I don't have time for this you guys. Just give 'em back their spaces.
wb_jones Jones OK.
paul_faust We good? OK. Could have done this over e-mail.
kevin_malone After Stacy left, things did not go well for awhile. And, and it was hard to see... It's just nice to win one.
michael_scott Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?
pam_beesly She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.
michael_scott Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...
jim_halpert Margaret?
pam_beesly I know.
jim_halpert You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment.
pam_beesly Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.
jim_halpert Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.
pam_beesly Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.
jim_halpert OK, sure. Let's do it.
pam_beesly No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.
jim_halpert Have I not proposed to you, yet?
pam_beesly Hmm, I don't, know...
jim_halpert Oh, well, that's coming.
pam_beesly Oh, right now?
jim_halpert No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.
pam_beesly OK, so then, when?
jim_halpert Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.
pam_beesly Oh, right, yeah.
jim_halpert Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.
pam_beesly Ohh kay.
jim_halpert And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.
pam_beesly I've been warned.
jim_halpert I am not kidding. Got it a week after we started dating.
michael_scott I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just...
dwight_schrute You know what you need? Closure.
michael_scott You're right. What do you mean though?
dwight_schrute There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
michael_scott Hmm.
dwight_schrute Come on. I'll drive.
kevin_malone We did it.
andy_bernard I did it.
kevin_malone We got our spaces back.
oscar_martinez Wow.
pam_beesly Nice job.
jim_halpert Nice.
andy_bernard Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.
andy_bernard Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
michael_scott How did she die?
dwight_schrute I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
michael_scott God.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott She was so innocent.
dwight_schrute She was stoned apparently.
michael_scott You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
dwight_schrute You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
michael_scott Oh, you move on.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
jim_halpert Where do you want to go for dinner?
pam_beesly I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what , that one...
jim_halpert Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?
pam_beesly I hate you.
jim_halpert What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
pam_beesly Oh, oh.
jim_halpert No, no, no.
pam_beesly How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
michael_scott Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off and die?
michael_scott@dwight_schrute OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
michael_scott Return.
dwight_schrute Rhythm and blues...
michael_scott This'll be the day that I died.
