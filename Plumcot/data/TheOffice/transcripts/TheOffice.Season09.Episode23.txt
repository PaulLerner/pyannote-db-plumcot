dwight_schrute The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
Camera#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 Man We're getting bonus footage for the DVD.
dwight_schrute pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
Camera#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 Man It'll be a pledge gift.
dwight_schrute PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
dwight_schrute In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a "where are they now" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go.
dwight_schrute Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
kevin_malone Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
stanley_hudson Ah, I've been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
meredith_palmer Speech!
dwight_schrute No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin.
kevin_malone Yes! Wait, why?
dwight_schrute Go ahead and just read the frosting.
kevin_malone "Get out."
dwight_schrute Uh-huh.
kevin_malone What does that mean?
dwight_schrute It's a colloquial way of saying "you're fired," Kevin, which you are.
pam_beesly What? Dwight, you can't do that.
dwight_schrute The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
all@ What?!
dwight_schrute Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
all@ Dwight...
dwight_schrute Based...on his merit.
oscar_martinez Ooh.
jim_halpert Umm....
kevin_malone I'm...good.
pam_beesly Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so...
toby_flenderson Yeah. Yeah, I don't think...
dwight_schrute Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. Bye, bye Toby.
kevin_malone At least I got chocolate.
jim_halpert I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too.
jim_halpert Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
all@ Whoo! Yeah
jim_halpert Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
jim_halpert And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
pam_beesly Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
angela_martin Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. Look at Meredith. She's disgusting. Those feet. They're like the paws of an orangutan.
pam_beesly I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much.
dwight_schrute That is all. Have a good morning.
meredith_palmer Thank you.
dwight_schrute What was that for?
angela_martin To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful.
dwight_schrute Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
angela_martin D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
dwight_schrute Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him.
angela_martin I don't...I don't know why.
dwight_schrute I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band "The Grass Roots" in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
phyllis_vance Oh, some fudge?
Malcolm#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 Oh, thanks. I love your fudge.
phyllis_vance Thanks.
Malcolm#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
phyllis_vance Oh, you can afford it.
phyllis_vance After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But...he'll get there.
jim_halpert Okay, the limo's gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready ‘cause I want to pack in a lot.
zeke Party time! Whorehouse!
jim_halpert Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?
zeke Well, you're the bestisch mensch.
jim_halpert Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight...only good surprises. "Guten Pranken".
dwight_schrute Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight.
clark Great, now we got three hours to fill.
jim_halpert Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?
dwight_schrute Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
jim_halpert Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.
andy_bernard Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
nashua_employee Dean You can't just sit here and cry.
andy_bernard Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
andy_bernard Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
bill_hader Hader
seth_meyers Mayers Oh, Don't. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don't be such a baby.
bill_hader Hader
seth_meyers Mayers Oh, No. It's gonna be alright.
bill_hader Hader
seth_meyers Mayers It's gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I'm Seth Meyers. That's Baby Wawa. Good night.
bill_hader Hader Bye!
andy_bernard After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. Not really my scene.
oscar_martinez Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you...hold on.
dakota_kevins_replacement Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means.
oscar_martinez That's the reason Kevin got fired. It's his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, "A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven." He was home by 4 45 that day.
nellie_bertram Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
toby_flenderson Hello! Hello!
nellie_bertram Oh.
toby_flenderson Hi!
nellie_bertram No.
toby_flenderson Oh.
nellie_bertram How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
toby_flenderson Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
nellie_bertram No. And I thought I unfriended you.
toby_flenderson Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
toby_flenderson After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ‘cause they have to give you one month's notice before they leave.
andy_bernard Hey-OH!
meredith_palmer Andy?
oscar_martinez You're back?
andy_bernard Yeah.
Malcolm#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!
jim_halpert Hey man, good to see you.
andy_bernard Thank you. Yeah,
phyllis_vance . Andy...
andy_bernard Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
phyllis_vance Andy, I've been worried about you. How are you?
andy_bernard A little warm.
phyllis_vance Poor, poor Andy.
andy_bernard Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
darryl_philbin Hello, hello.
jim_halpert Hey!
meredith_palmer Darryl!
andy_bernard Hey!
darryl_philbin Hey, what's up?
andy_bernard Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
darryl_philbin What? Must've been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
andy_bernard Hmm.
darryl_philbin Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um...I didn't call ‘cause I figured you changed the number.
andy_bernard No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
dwight_schrute What? Ooh!
andy_bernard Surprise!
dwight_schrute I thought you guys couldn't come.
darryl_philbin Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
jim_halpert Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? "Guten Prank" number one.
darryl_philbin You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
dwight_schrute Uh, better ask Jim.
jim_halpert And Jim will say nothing.
pam_beesly Darryl! Andy!
andy_bernard Hey! Pam!
darryl_philbin Hey, Pam! How are you?
pam_beesly We're fine. Yeah. And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn't you be?
andy_bernard Mm-hmm.
pam_beesly Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
darryl_philbin I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
jim_halpert Yeah?
darryl_philbin Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are...for real.
jim_halpert Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to.
oscar_martinez Whoo, whoo, whoo.
pam_beesly Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
oscar_martinez Yeah!
andy_bernard Aw!
darryl_philbin Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever.
oscar_martinez They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
oscar_martinez WASSUUUUP!
dwight_schrute Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary.
jim_halpert Get out.
dwight_schrute Jim...wha... Come on! What...what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
jim_halpert No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking.
dwight_schrute A bazooka. You remembered.
jim_halpert Of course I did.
dwight_schrute . Get out of my way.
all@ OH!
dwight_schrute Woo! Okay!
jim_halpert Yeah! Guten Prank number two.
jim_halpert Private Room.
oscar_martinez Yeah, brosef.
dwight_schrute Amazing.
jim_halpert Enjoy, enjoy.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry?
jim_halpert Okay, man, easy.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23
jim_halpert Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
andy_bernard Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral.
darryl_philbin That happens a lot?
andy_bernard Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
oscar_martinez Well, I bet it was a smash.
andy_bernard That's how I got my new job in the admissions office.
oscar_martinez Is that a volunteer program or...
andy_bernard No. It's a job. Things are going great.
darryl_philbin Let's get a drink in you, huh?
andy_bernard Yes.
meredith_palmer Whoo-hoo. Let's get this party started!
rachael Where's my angel.
angela_martin This is my big sister Rachel.
rachael No, this is my big sister Angela.
angela_martin We're very close. We even have our own special language.
rachael
angela_martin People love it.
rachael They do.
dwight_schrute Man, how long have we been sitting here?
elizabeth_the_stripper Hi, boys!
all@ Ohh...
clark Here we go!
dwight_schrute Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
elizabeth_the_stripper Hey, did somebody order the chef special?
darryl_philbin Right there.
dwight_schrute No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?
elizabeth_the_stripper I bet you boys have a big appetite.
dwight_schrute Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
elizabeth_the_stripper Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want.
dwight_schrute Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
elizabeth_the_stripper Ohh, shh.
dwight_schrute Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.
erin_hannon Whoo!
angela_martin What? Okay.
pam_beesly Oh, boy.
erin_hannon Oh!
jake_palmer Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed or cleaned or whatever.
phyllis_vance Angela's special repairman is here.
angela_martin Wait, what is this?
meredith_palmer Shut up. Jakey?
jake_palmer Mom?
pam_beesly Wait, wait. What?
jake_palmer Oh, man.
meredith_palmer No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom's not here.
pam_beesly Uh, that seems inappropriate.
meredith_palmer Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
jake_palmer Okay.
meredith_palmer Take it off. . Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper's only as good as his song.
rachael oh, wowee wow.
angela_martin Okay...
pam_beesly Whoo-hoo...go, Meredith's stripper son.
angela_martin Rachel, are you all right?
rachael I don't know! I don't know.
angela_martin Oh geeze. . Oh, my God!
meredith_palmer Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look.
angela_martin Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
meredith_palmer Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
angela_martin Uh, no. It's o...thank you. You know what? You don't have to...oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay.
dwight_schrute Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic.
clark Dwight, for the last time, she's not a waitress.
dwight_schrute You're telling me!
oscar_martinez If you want her to leave, just tip her.
dwight_schrute What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?
angela_martin That was interesting. What was that?
phyllis_vance It's just the wind.
angela_martin Will you lock the door?
phyllis_vance Okay. It's just the wind, see? Nothing.
angela_martin Alright, see, you don't have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It's the wind. Just come and shut... OH! My God!
all@
erin_hannon Phyllis!
rachael What's happening?
dwight_schrute Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.
jim_halpert Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
dwight_schrute Good old Mose.
jim_halpert They think it was Mose.
dwight_schrute Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
oscar_martinez What is that?
dwight_schrute A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
jim_halpert Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?
dwight_schrute Right. Which one is that?
jim_halpert Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?
jim_halpert Is that Mose?
dwight_schrute Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
mose Well, first, buy us a drink.
all@ If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink.
dwight_schrute Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! Oh.
kevin_malone Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six "wells." Did I get that number right, Dwight?
dwight_schrute I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
kevin_malone Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
dwight_schrute Why did you pick this place?
jim_halpert Ooh.
dwight_schrute You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
jim_halpert Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.
dwight_schrute Waste of a good hatchet.
jim_halpert Okay, just talk.
kevin_malone Well, w...
dwight_schrute I heard you say "well" the first time.
jim_halpert I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.
dwight_schrute It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.
kevin_malone You're just saying that to make me feel better.
dwight_schrute No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
kevin_malone Is that all it was?
dwight_schrute That's it.
kevin_malone Come here
dwight_schrute I missed you Kevin.
kevin_malone I missed you!
dwight_schrute Ohh.
mose Guten Prank.
jim_halpert Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
dwight_schrute You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?
dwight_schrute Mose! What..ooh, Mose.
angela_martin What the is your problem you ?!
jim_halpert Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or...
dwight_schrute No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
jim_halpert Right.
stanley_hudson Hey guys.
all@ Stanley!
erin_hannon How's Florida?
stanley_hudson Oh, great.
stanley_hudson Yes, I'm living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
jim_halpert Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
pam_beesly No, no, I'm fine.
jim_halpert Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
stanley_hudson I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
andy_bernard I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
andy_bernard Just sit here and cry, just sit here and cry! Oh I can so just sit here and cry. You guys are really mean. It can't end like this you know. Slept in my car last night, quit my job. Burned all my bridges. And I did unspeakable things – You're just not good, you're just not good. – Are you insane? – You're just not good, you're just not good. – Chill out! Just sit here and cry...
kevin_malone People actually dance to this. It's in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
kevin_malone Yeah, people hate you.
andy_bernard I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home.
santigold Hey! It's Andy Bernard!
all@ Nard Dog! Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
andy_bernard Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
santigold 1 How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv?
david_wallace Wallace It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it.
dwight_schrute With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
pete_miller Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So... thanks PBS.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 1 Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we'd all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?
pam_beesly Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something.
jim_halpert She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.
all@ Awww.
jim_halpert O-Kay.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 2 All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that... he could do anything. Anything.
pam_beesly I'm sorry. Is there a question?
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 2 Uh, no.
santigold 2 Pam, what was in that teapot letter?
pam_beesly Oh, um, well, you know, I... I just... I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
santigold 2 I hear ya. What did it say?
pbs_panel_moderator We're gonna move on. Next question please.
santigold 3 Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore?
toby_flenderson Yes.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 3 I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?
meredith_palmer I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn't show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 4 I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?
jim_halpert Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
pam_beesly Listen, um... I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end. And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 4 Like Harry Potter.
pam_beesly Yeah, like Harry Potter.
woman_guarding_pbs_swag_at_warehouse I have a question for Erin.
erin_hannon Really?
woman_guarding_pbs_swag_at_warehouse Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother.
erin_hannon Thank you.
woman_guarding_pbs_swag_at_warehouse So my question is, um, do... don't you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her.
erin_hannon Maybe sometimes. But not like "hate" hate. More just like, "Mom, I hate you!" And then she would say "go to your room, young lady." And I'd stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we'd just have dinner together. But I don't know. I'd have to meet her. Thanks.
woman_guarding_pbs_swag_at_warehouse Erin...
erin_hannon Yes?
woman_guarding_pbs_swag_at_warehouse Um...Oh, Erin..
erin_hannon Yes? Is there a follow-up question? Mom?
erins_biological_father Erin... Same question but about your dad?
pbs_panel_moderator Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let's thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today. Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don't forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic.
kevin_malone Where's the, uh, basket for gifts?
caterer_greeting_guests Right there, sir.
kevin_malone Okay.
dakota_kevins_replacement Hi, I'm Dakota.
creed_bratton Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
dakota_kevins_replacement Nice.
creed_bratton My wife's name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
kelly_kapoor Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
ravi Thanks for helping out, sweetie.
ryan_howard Kelly, you're here.
kelly_kapoor Hey, Ryan!
ryan_howard Hey.
kelly_kapoor Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
ryan_howard No, this little guy is mine.
ryan_howard So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book.
ryan_howard Say "hi", Drake.
kelly_kapoor Drake is your baby's name?
ryan_howard Yeah.
kelly_kapoor That is an amazing name. I'm obsessed with Drake. His last album... it just touched me to pieces.
ryan_howard No Kelly, he's no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It's Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
kelly_kapoor Cool. Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I'm obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
ravi They're called premature, sweetie. It's good to see you again Ryan.
phyllis_vance Let me help you us.
angela_martin Thanks. Oh. Ouch.
pam_beesly Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
angela_martin No, my heels aren't too high. It's because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. Sorry Phyllis. You didn't know. As long as I can get to the altar.
phyllis_vance Oh, I'm gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
jim_halpert You ready?
dwight_schrute You kidding? I was born ready.
jim_halpert Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um... I don't know how to tell you this, but... we have a little bit of a problem.
dwight_schrute Oh, no. What?
jim_halpert The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
dwight_schrute Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.
jim_halpert I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-
dwight_schrute Not... significant is a big word...
jim_halpert I think it's definitely... Well, okay. Either way...
dwight_schrute I think you're only a teeny...
jim_halpert Either way, Dwight... I can't be there for you. I'm sorry.
dwight_schrute Jim.
jim_halpert I just...really wish there was something I could do.
dwight_schrute Michael. I can't believe you came.
michael_scott That's what she said.
jim_halpert Best prank ever.
the_minister As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do.
nellie_bertram See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
kevin_malone "Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. "
the_minister I now pronounce you man and wife. Release the doves!
kelly_kapoor Oh.
kevin_malone That's not...
dwight_schrute Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ‘em on in there.
dwight_schrute Everybody!
jim_halpert See, now you don't owe me anything.
ryan_howard Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he's hot.
ravi Oh, no.
ryan_howard I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
ravi Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?
ryan_howard Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
ravi Are you sure you don't wanna go in?
kelly_kapoor Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
ryan_howard Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
kelly_kapoor I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good.
ryan_howard He'll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He's allergic but he'll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
kelly_kapoor You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me?
pam_beesly Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
pam_beesly Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!
pam_beesly He just so happy to have a family plan.
erins_biological_father Where'd you learn to dance like that?
erin_hannon I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing.
toby_flenderson
pam_beesly Is it me? Is it Nellie?
toby_flenderson It's everything.
phyllis_vance I missed you.
stanley_hudson I missed you too.
phyllis_vance Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson's a mean old grump. But would a grump make this? It's me. It's me.
ryan_howard I love you.
kelly_kapoor I love you too.
ryan_howard We're gonna be together forever.
kelly_kapoor We're running off into the sunset.
ryan_howard I finally mastered commitment.
kevin_malone What was that stuff?
ravi Hey, has anyone seen Ryan... or Kelly?
kevin_malone Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
ravi Oh, that's it. Here. Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We'll find a better parent than Ryan in no time.
kevin_malone Oh, I don't know.
nellie_bertram Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will... who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
kevin_malone Hey, this is better.
nellie_bertram Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
nellie_bertram If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We'll be somewhere in Europe. Won't we?
michael_scott I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.
darryl_philbin Thank you go much.
dwight_schrute Good night.
toby_flenderson Good luck.
val Great. It was really fun.
dwight_schrute Good evening.
val The Doc crew's throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
darryl_philbin Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. No offense. You going, Toby?
toby_flenderson Oh, I don't know. I might turn in early.
andy_bernard It's only 6 00. Come on, everybody's going.
meredith_palmer You have to go, Toby.
pete_miller Yeah, come on, Tobes.
val Come on.
toby_flenderson Yeah. I'll stop by.
pete_miller There he is!
pam_beesly I need to get out of this dress.
jim_halpert I gotta get out of this dress.
carol_stills Stills Oh, I'm sorry Pam.
jim_halpert What's going on?
pam_beesly Why are you still here?
carol_stills I'm so sorry. They were an hour late.
jim_halpert No, really, what's going on?
pam_beesly Okay, Okay. Um... so... this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just... I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture... and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
jim_halpert Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
pam_beesly About 2 months
jim_halpert That's why it's so clean.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
pam_beesly Well, you... you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
jim_halpert Oh... okay. Where would we go?
pam_beesly Austin? Maybe.
jim_halpert I promise you, you don't have to do this for me.
pam_beesly I'm doing it for us.
jim_halpert The last...
Buyer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 Okay. We'll take it.
jim_halpert Hold on a second. The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about...
pam_beesly Hold on a second. Wait, what did you just say?
Buyer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 We wanna buy your house.
jim_halpert You wanna do this?
pam_beesly I wanna do this.
jim_halpert You really want to do this?
pam_beesly I really want to do this!
jim_halpert Oh my God!
jim_halpert Hey, Darryl.
darryl_philbin What? All right!
pam_beesly We're so excited.
phyllis_vance Cool.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode23 Oh, that's for PBS executives only.
stanley_hudson I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
david_wallace Wallace I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I'd love to contribute to your campaign.
oscar_martinez Thank you David.
pam_beesly Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper...,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. And go ahead!
pam_beesly Everyone, Let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just...I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
nate Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody.
jim_halpert Let's go outside
pam_beesly Okay.
stanley_hudson Okay, I need a drink.
kevin_malone Yeah, we all need a drink. What the...there's only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
meredith_palmer Hey, bottom drawer.
kevin_malone Yes!
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.
pam_beesly I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But...it would just...just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself "be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long."
kevin_malone If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural.
dwight_schrute Hey guys.
angela_martin Hi.
all@ Hey!
pam_beesly What about the honeymoon?
angela_martin Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
dwight_schrute Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? What is that meaningful look?
jim_halpert You know what? Maybe we should talk.
darryl_philbin Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
kevin_malone What is it?
andy_bernard You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
pam_beesly I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing...
jim_halpert Athleap.
pam_beesly And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially...
dwight_schrute No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!
jim_halpert Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note.
dwight_schrute Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.
pam_beesly Thanks Dwight.
jim_halpert Hey, and if you're ever in Austin...
dwight_schrute Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn.
jim_halpert There it is.
dwight_schrute Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So... have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So...yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
andy_bernard You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with me Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
kevin_malone Oh, Yes!
darryl_philbin You did good. Real good.
andy_bernard Thanks Dad...Darryl.
andy_bernard I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. Someone should write a song about that.
oscar_martinez You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way...And that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami.
creed_bratton Uh..ohh!
creed_bratton I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same...
jim_halpert Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes...and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's...an amazing gift.
phyllis_vance Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
jim_halpert Thanks Phyl.
creed_bratton I still have my medal from that.
angela_martin Do you even have a mattress?
creed_bratton No, but I still have my medal from that.
kevin_malone Oscar. Oscar. I think I'm gay.
oscar_martinez Why do you say that?
kevin_malone It's just that I'm so emotional.
oscar_martinez Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay.
kevin_malone No, but maybe the reason...
oscar_martinez You're not gay.
creed_bratton And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
erin_hannon How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
darryl_philbin Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
creed_bratton It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But... no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. Let's do this.
meredith_palmer I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they're the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You're not alone sister. Let's get a beer sometime.
phyllis_vance I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
jim_halpert I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid...wonderful...boring...amazing job.
pam_beesly I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all...I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?
