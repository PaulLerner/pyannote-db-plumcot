michael_scott Everybody! Everybody! Listen up, I need your ideas, now! Ideas please, right now! Go! Go! Come on!
pam_beesly Michael we don't know what you're talking about...
michael_scott Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
kevin_malone Michael you could put your initials in it.
michael_scott M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
jim_halpert Yeah that's true.
michael_scott Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
phyllis_vance We-- we--
michael_scott Here we go!
phyllis_vance Well--
michael_scott Let's, yes?
phyllis_vance When I was a little girl...
michael_scott Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
phyllis_vance We-we found some wet cement in the park...
michael_scott It's drying, it's drying...
phyllis_vance In our neighborhood...
michael_scott Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
phyllis_vance What did we write?
michael_scott Ahh come on!
andy_bernard Here it is, you should draw a picture...
michael_scott No!
andy_bernard Cause that says, that says...
michael_scott No!
andy_bernard So much more than words...
michael_scott No!! Come on, gimme something good!
kelly_kapoor Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good...
michael_scott Pam, translate.
pam_beesly She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
michael_scott I love it!
jim_halpert If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
michael_scott I love it more!
oscar_martinez Michael that doesn't seem... safe.
michael_scott I... love it!! Haha, come on!
dwight_schrute Come on!
jim_halpert We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea... Maybe the idea of a man.
michael_scott Hurry, please.
jim_halpert Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
dwight_schrute Can you breathe?
jim_halpert Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
dwight_schrute Hold your breath.
jim_halpert And in this case...
dwight_schrute Ready?
jim_halpert That's also not true.
dwight_schrute And... go. Force it in as deep as you can.
michael_scott That's what she said.
michael_scott Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole..." I dunno, it's a good feeling.
andy_bernard Okay, adjective...
angela_martin Um... tall. No, no, uh, nice.
andy_bernard Good one. Okay, you ready?
angela_martin Mmhmm.
andy_bernard The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?"
angela_martin It's a man eating cat food.
andy_bernard What about a cat eating man food?
dwight_schrute Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
pam_beesly Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.
michael_scott All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...
pam_beesly I don't have my contacts...
michael_scott Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
michael_scott Ener-gize...
jim_halpert You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
pam_beesly Don't, don't--
jim_halpert Would...
pam_beesly If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.
jim_halpert Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
michael_scott Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
andy_bernard What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?
michael_scott Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
jim_halpert What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
michael_scott Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
jim_halpert An urban thing...
michael_scott An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
stanley_hudson Not me.
michael_scott Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
stanley_hudson No.
michael_scott Stanley, we're havin a little...
stanley_hudson Leave me alone, dammit.
michael_scott We're havin a little brainstorm session...
stanley_hudson DID I STUTTER?
michael_scott ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
toby_flenderson Can I talk to you a second?
michael_scott Ugh, what?
toby_flenderson Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with Stanley this morning...
michael_scott What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
toby_flenderson Well, you know, Stanley was openly insubordinate.
michael_scott That? In the conference room?
toby_flenderson Yeah.
michael_scott We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
toby_flenderson He didn't seem like he was joking.
michael_scott Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another "Hey um, you're poor." "Well hey, you're mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.
toby_flenderson Alright... Well, um, if you really believe that Stanley was joking...
michael_scott Mmhmm.
toby_flenderson Um, why don't you go ask him that?
michael_scott Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
toby_flenderson You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school...
michael_scott Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
andy_bernard You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
dwight_schrute Unh! Scratch.
andy_bernard That's a racing stripe.
dwight_schrute Uh, bumper's sagging.
andy_bernard Mmm, I doubt that very much.
dwight_schrute This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
andy_bernard How next to?
dwight_schrute Well, here are your options you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
andy_bernard I have to pick one of those?
dwight_schrute Yes.
andy_bernard Can you go over those options again?
dwight_schrute You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
andy_bernard Well I have the, the blue book value...
dwight_schrute Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
andy_bernard Can I think about it?
dwight_schrute Five, four, three, two...
andy_bernard Let me think about it--
dwight_schrute Now. Now. Now.
andy_bernard Let me think about it--
dwight_schrute Say it. Do it. Now.
andy_bernard I'm thinking about it--
dwight_schrute Do it now.
andy_bernard Thinking--
dwight_schrute Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
andy_bernard Yeah. All right!
stanley_hudson What.
michael_scott I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
stanley_hudson What are you talking about?
michael_scott Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
stanley_hudson I am not going to apologize to you.
stanley_hudson It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
dwight_schrute Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
michael_scott Uh huh...
dwight_schrute There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
michael_scott Great
dwight_schrute However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
michael_scott What's the pink?
dwight_schrute Menstrual cycles.
michael_scott Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
dwight_schrute You.
michael_scott Other than me.
dwight_schrute Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
michael_scott I never said you could do that.
dwight_schrute All you have to do it say it.
michael_scott I...
dwight_schrute Just say it.
michael_scott Okay, I will think about it.
dwight_schrute Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
kevin_malone Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
pam_beesly Oh, thanks.
kevin_malone All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
pam_beesly Oh, okay...
kevin_malone Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually...
pam_beesly I should probably get back to...
kevin_malone Like librarians.
pam_beesly Entering the....
kevin_malone Could you just say, "these are due back Thursday"?
pam_beesly No. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead.
creed_bratton A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
darryl_philbin Mike.
michael_scott Hey.
darryl_philbin I'm very busy here, man.
michael_scott Darryl, have you ever been in a gang?
darryl_philbin Why?
michael_scott It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
darryl_philbin No, no, no...
michael_scott I know, it's very, very personal...
darryl_philbin No, um... I have.
michael_scott I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
darryl_philbin Both.
michael_scott God.
darryl_philbin Yeah them, and the Latin Kings... the Warriors...
michael_scott Okay.
darryl_philbin Newsies.
michael_scott Okay, so dig this you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
darryl_philbin Oh my goodness.
michael_scott Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
darryl_philbin Well see, um... in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
michael_scott What is that?
darryl_philbin That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just... start tickling them.
michael_scott Really?
darryl_philbin Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together... get an ice cream cone.
michael_scott I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
darryl_philbin Well, it's effective.
ryan_howard I think it's self-explanatory. Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
jim_halpert Oh boy...
ryan_howard How do you live with a franchise this bad?
jim_halpert On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
ryan_howard Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
jim_halpert A formal warning...
ryan_howard It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with Dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
jim_halpert I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
ryan_howard This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
jim_halpert I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
ryan_howard Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, Toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
toby_flenderson I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him... w-with Pam
pam_beesly Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?
jim_halpert Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
pam_beesly Because you're very important?
jim_halpert Yeah...
dwight_schrute Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
andy_bernard What the hell is this all about? You're flipping my car for profit.
dwight_schrute It's my car now.
andy_bernard I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
dwight_schrute Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
dwight_schrute I've got a Madlib for you a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
michael_scott Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
pam_beesly What does that mean?
michael_scott It's like a mock execution.
jim_halpert That's not a good idea.
michael_scott Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
toby_flenderson Well, you can actually fire him.
michael_scott No, okay... I've had enough of you.
oscar_martinez Why are you telling us this?
michael_scott Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
kevin_malone Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
michael_scott I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
michael_scott Stanley Hudson, you are fired.
stanley_hudson Are you serious?
michael_scott I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
stanley_hudson You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
michael_scott Hmm.
stanley_hudson I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
michael_scott Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
stanley_hudson So I'm not fired.
michael_scott That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
stanley_hudson Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
michael_scott Okay...
stanley_hudson Do you have any idea how to run an office?
michael_scott Yes.
stanley_hudson Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
michael_scott That's not-
stanley_hudson And I think, "there's no possible way--
michael_scott All right, all right...
stanley_hudson He can top that."
michael_scott Okay.
stanley_hudson But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
michael_scott Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
jim_halpert Who?
michael_scott Everybody, except Stanley.
jim_halpert Let's go.
pam_beesly I can't find my glasses.
jim_halpert Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
pam_beesly Okay, okay.
kevin_malone It's Michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
michael_scott I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
stanley_hudson Oh, for the love of God.
michael_scott You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
stanley_hudson Fine. Here it is you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
michael_scott Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
stanley_hudson Michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
michael_scott All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
stanley_hudson Fair enough.
michael_scott I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after s*x, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "I don't respect you!" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. Respect is niiice. Borat. What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!
michael_scott So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
stanley_hudson Has potential to be your best idea yet.
phyllis_vance That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
michael_scott Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
