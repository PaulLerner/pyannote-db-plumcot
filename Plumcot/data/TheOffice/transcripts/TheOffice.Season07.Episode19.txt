michael_scott Kahlua Sombrero, please.
Waiter#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode19 All right, so just you tonight?
michael_scott Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
deangelo_vickers I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.
michael_scott Oh, really?
deangelo_vickers To begginings and endings.
michael_scott And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
deangelo_vickers The moms and the troops.
michael_scott Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
deangelo_vickers I won't... I don't know her.
michael_scott I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
deangelo_vickers Colorado! The sunshine state.
michael_scott Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
deangelo_vickers Doing some skiing?
michael_scott No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
deangelo_vickers Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
michael_scott You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
deangelo_vickers Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess.
michael_scott That's what I've heard.
deangelo_vickers I'm an olympics nut.
michael_scott Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
deangelo_vickers@michael_scott Summer!
deangelo_vickers Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you...
deangelo_vickers You know, it's funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.
michael_scott Really? What happened?
deangelo_vickers You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?
michael_scott Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
deangelo_vickers That's the way it goes.
michael_scott Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry.
deangelo_vickers Excuse me. Hello? You running late?
michael_scott No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.
deangelo_vickers I'm at the bar too.
michael_scott You are? What bar?
deangelo_vickers I'm at the bar. The bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel.
michael_scott I... do not see you.
deangelo_vickers How long have you...
michael_scott I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
deangelo_vickers Ok, me too.
deangelo_vickers@michael_scott Sorry...
michael_scott What're you wearing?
deangelo_vickers I am wearing a grey suit, red tie.
michael_scott Are we both at the right place?
deangelo_vickers Which place?
michael_scott I hear your voice.
deangelo_vickers I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.
michael_scott I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! Michael Scott.
deangelo_vickers Deangelo Vickers.
michael_scott Wow... that is insane!
deangelo_vickers That is insane, that is the right term. Let's get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.
michael_scott Here we go! Are you ready?
deangelo_vickers I am ready.
michael_scott Alright! Here we go!
michael_scott This is it. What do you think?
deangelo_vickers Oh, she'll do. She'll do just fine.
deangelo_vickers I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune...
michael_scott
deangelo_vickers Did that? Did that just happen?! We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious!
oscar_martinez Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
kevin_malone Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart!
michael_scott Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
deangelo_vickers
michael_scott Come on out!
deangelo_vickers Hello! How are you sir?
michael_scott I am well, sir, how are you?
deangelo_vickers Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-
dwight_schrute Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
kelly_kapoor I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
deangelo_vickers I'll help you.
kelly_kapoor Oh, hi!
deangelo_vickers Hello!
kelly_kapoor Have we met before?
deangelo_vickers No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.
kelly_kapoor Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
deangelo_vickers
kelly_kapoor And that is what you call a meet cute.
michael_scott And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!
darryl_philbin Kind of embarassing.
angela_martin Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
michael_scott I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
deangelo_vickers Oh. That was... let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there!
michael_scott Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
deangelo_vickers
andy_bernard That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
deangelo_vickers Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!
andy_bernard I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
michael_scott This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
pam_beesly Well, it wasn't an affair.
michael_scott Yes it was.
pam_beesly But, no, but we are a family.
jim_halpert We made that.
pam_beesly Cecelia.
deangelo_vickers Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.
pam_beesly Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four.
pam_beesly Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
jim_halpert Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
dwight_schrute Thanks for meeting me.
michael_scott Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
dwight_schrute There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
michael_scott You know me very well, Dwight.
dwight_schrute That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
michael_scott Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
dwight_schrute I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
meredith_palmer That apple looks delic!
deangelo_vickers I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200.
stanley_hudson Deangelo, you're going to starve to death.
michael_scott So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
darryl_philbin It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
darryl_philbin It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
darryl_philbin I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
deangelo_vickers Here's the great thing about the southwest; there's so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen.
kevin_malone Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
angela_martin Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
deangelo_vickers I did not.
angela_martin Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
deangelo_vickers Sounds very interesting, thank you.
erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
deangelo_vickers Why do you use your name when you use the phone?
erin_hannon Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
deangelo_vickers Try it without using your name.
erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
deangelo_vickers Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?
erin_hannon Oh, assist.
michael_scott I sorta like the old way.
deangelo_vickers I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point.
michael_scott I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
deangelo_vickers And it really isn't.
michael_scott Is that good?
erin_hannon Yeah, ok, good.
deangelo_vickers Well, I'd like to change it, actually.
michael_scott Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
erin_hannon What do you think?
deangelo_vickers I think a change would be nice.
michael_scott You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
deangelo_vickers Change it.
erin_hannon ...I'm so sorry. Sorry.
deangelo_vickers Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can't even look at you.
andy_bernard Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call...
erin_hannon Deangelo, did you order a barber?
deangelo_vickers Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline.
darryl_philbin Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
andy_bernard I... don't know. Help me.
ryan_howard That is so badass. So hardcore.
phyllis_vance Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
deangelo_vickers I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
michael_scott Shave me. This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
deangelo_vickers Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close.
michael_scott And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.
deangelo_vickers Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it?
michael_scott It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
oscar_martinez You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
deangelo_vickers Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
michael_scott Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
deangelo_vickers Ok, then, powwows then, fine.
michael_scott That's-
pam_beesly Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
jim_halpert Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
pam_beesly Da-das.
jim_halpert And what happens here is-
deangelo_vickers You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry.
jim_halpert We were... I think she was just trying to-
deangelo_vickers No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?
michael_scott You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
oscar_martinez Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
michael_scott Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
erin_hannon Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
michael_scott Don't shave my lips.
deangelo_vickers What's up?
andy_bernard I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
andy_bernard I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
andy_bernard ...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
deangelo_vickers Let's not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.
andy_bernard I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where-
deangelo_vickers Now that's funny! That's funny! You walk much?
andy_bernard Yeah, right, I mean-
deangelo_vickers Little click...
erin_hannon Deangelo, this box came for you.
deangelo_vickers Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.
stanley_hudson Need a hand?
deangelo_vickers Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley!
michael_scott You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
ryan_howard
michael_scott I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
darryl_philbin So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
deangelo_vickers Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.
kevin_malone Interesting.
michael_scott Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
darryls_sister
darryl_philbin Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
darryls_sister Hey, hey, hey!
darryl_philbin No, I'm good. Keep them.
deangelo_vickers Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?
andy_bernard Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here...
deangelo_vickers Drink some soap!
andy_bernard
deangelo_vickers
andy_bernard I guess this is my life now.
dwight_schrute How do I become a manger at Sabre?
gabe_lewis First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
dwight_schrute I left a message at corporate.
gabe_lewis Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
dwight_schrute Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
gabe_lewis What recommendation?
dwight_schrute From when he recommended me to replace him.
gabe_lewis ...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
deangelo_vickers Best whale watching easily the west coast. If you're going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called "West Coast Whales'. Because you're not gonna see them-
michael_scott Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
kevin_malone Awesome!
phyllis_vance Mmm, whatcha got?
michael_scott PB and J, my mom's recipe!
angela_martin Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
deangelo_vickers I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.
stanley_hudson What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
michael_scott I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!
oscar_martinez Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
michael_scott What?
deangelo_vickers Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.
jim_halpert Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
deangelo_vickers No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.
michael_scott Oscar, here you go.
deangelo_vickers You're getting nut particles all in the air!
michael_scott No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
deangelo_vickers Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.
michael_scott No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. No body go in there. Stay where you are.
oscar_martinez Michael, This is insane.
michael_scott No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
jim_halpert Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
michael_scott Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
deangelo_vickers Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...?
michael_scott I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
deangelo_vickers Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. Bring it in, come on. Ok.
michael_scott Ok. Why did you have to be so damn good?
deangelo_vickers I... I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you.
michael_scott No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
deangelo_vickers Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You've worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It's Lake Havasu time!
Micahel#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode19 Guess I've been working so hard I forgot what it's like to be hardly working.
deangelo_vickers Ok. What is the Native American girl's name?
michael_scott You'll figure it out.
jim_halpert Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
deangelo_vickers That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.
jim_halpert Thank you very much.
pam_beesly See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
jim_halpert We're back in! Right?
deangelo_vickers I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled 'Babys I Don't Care About.'
