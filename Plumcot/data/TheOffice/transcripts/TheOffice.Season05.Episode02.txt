pam_beesly Well, I should go.
jim_halpert Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
pam_beesly No, don't. I'm mad at them.
jim_halpert Why, what happened?
pam_beesly Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
jim_halpert Ah. That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
pam_beesly What? Why not?
jim_halpert I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
pam_beesly Come on, it won't be that bad.
jim_halpert OK. You know what? Here we go. Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. Pam and I are engaged.
pam_beesly Hi everyone!
oscar_martinez I thought you were already engaged.
jim_halpert Nope.
angela_martin That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy.
jim_halpert Thank you Angela.
kevin_malone I got a gift for Pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one?
jim_halpert Yes.
andy_bernard A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
jim_halpert To get married.
dwight_schrute She's not a virgin, you know.
pam_beesly Wow.
michael_scott What's going on?
pam_beesly No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi.
creed_bratton The tall guy got engaged.
michael_scott To be married?
jim_halpert Yep.
pam_beesly Sorry.
holly_flax Pencils down! Just kidding, take your time.
holly_flax Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder.
dwight_schrute I got it, I got it.
michael_scott & Holly Let's get ethical! Ethical! I wanna get ethical! Let's get into Ethics yeah! Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk! Your body talk. Let me hear your body talk.
michael_scott WOO! Alright!
michael_scott "Why are you helping her? You're not even dating." She's my friend... and... ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship... without her even knowing. Uh...
michael_scott Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax!
holly_flax Thanks Michael. Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
kevin_malone Oh come on! He's right there. He was hired. Oh check it out, "Hired Guy."
jim_halpert Nice.
ryan_howard Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six? Anyone know Joanna on that show? In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So...
michael_scott Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
holly_flax Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning. It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
phyllis_vance I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
holly_flax Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
michael_scott Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.
holly_flax Thank you. In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
kelly_kapoor What?
holly_flax Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
stanley_hudson This meeting.
andy_bernard Hey-oh!
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott Can't set 'em up like that.
kelly_kapoor Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time? If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking. I'll do it. I don't care.
meredith_palmer I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
holly_flax Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
michael_scott Can we have a moment? Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
dwight_schrute Michael.
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
michael_scott Do some... do some work. People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
holly_flax Well, I just have to get through the binder.
michael_scott Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
holly_flax I am?
beth Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out.
holly_flax Ok. Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That's not right.
michael_scott Lauren, enough with the pencils.
holly_flax No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing.
oscar_martinez That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
andy_bernard I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!
oscar_martinez Exactly, Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah, I took intro to philosophy, twice. No big deal.
dwight_schrute It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
andy_bernard No that's... not how it works.
michael_scott I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.
holly_flax Ok, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
michael_scott Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on.
oscar_martinez Pass.
michael_scott I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
holly_flax What was the dilemma?
michael_scott To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
holly_flax Oh--- no no no.
michael_scott Yeah, . Come on, anybody. Let it fly.
oscar_martinez Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
michael_scott A siesta!
dwight_schrute Time thief. Time thief! Fire him!
jim_halpert Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
dwight_schrute Never!
michael_scott You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?
kelly_kapoor Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
michael_scott Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else?
holly_flax No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
michael_scott Mmm...
angela_martin I once reported Oscar to the INS. Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
michael_scott Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
meredith_palmer I'll go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
michael_scott Bruuuuuuuuuce.
meredith_palmer Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
jim_halpert Jackpot.
michael_scott Ach! Wuh---
holly_flax Meredith, that is serious. I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
meredith_palmer Exchange of steak. Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
michael_scott That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got? You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate.
holly_flax Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
michael_scott Oh...
holly_flax I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
beth Nnyeah. What ya gonna do?
holly_flax So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
meredith_palmer Liaisons, you mean meet-ups? I don't know, once a month for six years. Something like that.
michael_scott Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
meredith_palmer Am I in trouble here or something?
michael_scott No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
holly_flax No, it's not a formality. Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal? Unrelated to business?
meredith_palmer Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper. There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
beth Ughh! For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag.
holly_flax What I don't understand is... why the steak coupons? I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
meredith_palmer Well it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. Hey what's going on here? I thought I had immunity?
holly_flax Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace. I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
meredith_palmer Well... I'm not quitting.
jim_halpert Yawn. Four seconds.
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
jim_halpert Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
dwight_schrute Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. Really? Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti---
jim_halpert Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.
dwight_schrute There is no way that that was---
jim_halpert One second.
michael_scott Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
holly_flax It's Mike-raculous.
michael_scott Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
holly_flax Sounds good.
michael_scott Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
holly_flax Oh I already bought this...
michael_scott Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical.
holly_flax So, I've gone over corporate policy.
michael_scott What do you think? What do you think of this place?
holly_flax Oh, it's very nice.
michael_scott Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?
holly_flax Mmm.
michael_scott Wow, that sounds so... warm.
holly_flax In Summer.
michael_scott Here too. You know what my favorite season is?
holly_flax Maybe we should talk about Meredith first.
michael_scott Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
holly_flax Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
michael_scott Wow, terminator, terminator.
holly_flax I'm from da future.
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert Hey, Andy.
andy_bernard Yo.
jim_halpert By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
andy_bernard No, I did not. Was that any good?
jim_halpert Actually not. It was really so-so.
dwight_schrute Ok.
jim_halpert I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
andy_bernard Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
jim_halpert You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake.
andy_bernard Really? Huh, that's cool.
jim_halpert Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
andy_bernard Really? That doesn't sound right.
michael_scott I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And Meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money.
holly_flax Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules.
michael_scott Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her.
holly_flax We punish her?
michael_scott Mmhmm, tell her she can't have s*x for six months.
holly_flax I don't think we could enforce that.
michael_scott I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
holly_flax A chastity belt.
michael_scott No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
jim_halpert He has not stopped working for a second. At 12 45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1 32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting, being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today.
michael_scott I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
holly_flax No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire Meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
michael_scott Yes.
holly_flax What am I saying?
michael_scott Well... bleh busted. I don't...
holly_flax I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
michael_scott Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
holly_flax It's not a family. It's a workplace.
michael_scott I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers.
jim_halpert 19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
dwight_schrute None of your business.
jim_halpert So I guess I can assume that was personal.
dwight_schrute Fine.
jim_halpert So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
dwight_schrute Yes, maybe I'm not.
holly_flax It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over.
ryan_howard Kendall from corporate HR is on line one and Holly is on her way in too.
michael_scott What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
ryan_howard Two HR reps.
michael_scott You get me.
holly_flax Can I sit?
michael_scott I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man.
kendall Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship Meredith is having with..
holly_flax Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
michael_scott Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
kendall Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action.
holly_flax Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
kendall Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that.
holly_flax Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
kendall I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training.
holly_flax No, I understand.
kendall Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion.
holly_flax No. I can do it.
kendall Good.
michael_scott How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so." Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.
holly_flax Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please. We need to finish the ethics seminar.
andy_bernard No way, lady.
kevin_malone It's a trap.
holly_flax Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
meredith_palmer Don't sign anything.
michael_scott Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
stanley_hudson It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
michael_scott Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it!
meredith_palmer Am I getting fired?
michael_scott Now is really not the time, Meredith.
holly_flax In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days. Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers. Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
phyllis_vance Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
meredith_palmer Hey, where is the steak sauce?
kevin_malone I think we're out.
meredith_palmer I got some in my minivan somewhere.
andy_bernard Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
kevin_malone I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
phyllis_vance I don't care what she's doing. I just hope she keeps doing it.
stanley_hudson Amen. Just keep the ribs coming.
