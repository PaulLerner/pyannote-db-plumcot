michael Ok, well I did not get the job in New York, but I got the real prize, domestic bliss. jan made me breakfast this morning. well she bought the milk. It's soy. This is why I do it, that's what I have to come home to. She probably won't be up for a few hours.
michael This is going to be a very good year. Very good. jan is at home. jim is back. My protege ryan is at corporate. Good stuff. Um. andy and dwight are rockin' the sales team. I feel very blessed. IT Tech
guy You know generally it's not a good idea to click on offers that you haven't requested. What was the exact offer?
pam It was for a video. IT Tech
guy Yeah, what kind of video?
pam A celebrity s*x tape.
jim Really, what kind of celebrity?
pam Not relevant.
jim How much did you pay for it?
pam Not relevant.
jim You paid for it?
pam It all happened so fast.
jim I broke up with Karen after the job interview, and uh. it was a little awkward when she came back from the city. She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh. I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.
pam jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.
kevin Are you kidding me, pam and jim are totally hooking up. All they do is smile; they're just keeping it a secret. Right?
oscar I don't know, there is no evidence of intimacy. They've been in remarkably good moods. It could be other things.
kevin Are you kidding me?
pam And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.
jim Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
pam Cool.
jim Yeah.
pam Well have fun with that.
michael Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. meredith was hit by a car.
jim What?
dwight Where?
michael It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could. And she is going to be OK.
stanley What is wrong with you? Why did you have to phrase it like that?
oscar So she's really going to be fine?
michael Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah. people have survived far worse.
pam Thank God you were there.
michael Yeah.
andy Did you see who did it?
dwight No need we can just check the security tapes.
michael Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
jim Who was driving?
pam Oh, Michael.
jim One day michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.
dwight It's only Meredith.
michael Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
dwight Hey. Why did you do it?
michael It was an accident.
dwight Was she talkin' back?
michael No.
dwight Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
pam Hey guys, we're all gonna visit meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
kevin Who's we, you and Jim?
pam No, uh, me stanley and phyllis so far.
kevin Oh, I bet jim goes too.
pam Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.
kevin Oh, I bet you ask?
pam I was planning on it.
kevin I bet you were.
pam Angela?
oscar Subtle.
kevin What
pam Are you coming?
angela I can't, Sprinkles is sick.
angela She's been sick for some time. Thank you for asking, no one asks. about Sprinkles.
angela I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her, and who will she eat lunch with?
pam Can't your other cats keep her company.
angela There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
pam Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.
angela All right!
michael My lord my liege.
ryan Yes Michael?
michael So ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?
michael So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.
ryan Back? Why is that Michael?
michael Well, I ran down meredith in my car.
ryan Oh! Did you do this on purpose?
michael No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in.
ryan Did this happen on company property?
michael Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so. double jeopardy, we are fine.
ryan I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
michael Oh, right, I'm sorry. What
is we are fine?
ryan 
ryan People keep calling me a "Wunderkind"; I don't even know what that means. I mean, I know what it means, it means very successful for your age, so I guess it makes sense, but. it's a weird word.
angela Hey D.
dwight Hey monkey, what's up?
angela Can you do me a little favor? Go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine.
dwight Sure.
angela I have to visit the alchy.
dwight Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
angela I wouldn't put it past her.
dwight So what do you need me to do?
angela I wrote it out.
dwight Mm-hmm.
angela There's a diabetes shot, roll the insulin in your hand, don't shake it. She gets an ace inhibitor with her meal, but you have to put her right in front of the dish or she won't see it because of the cataracts. Mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine, um. and you want to give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten. And, oh and there's a fungal cream because she has this infection under her tail, so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
michael Ok, I have an announcement.
oscar You pushed darryl out the window?
michael No.
phyllis You shot Dwight?
michael No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
jim Oh good, so we don't have to work.
pam OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.
michael So, like a freedom tree.
pam I can take 3 people.
jim I can also take 3 people.
oscar Separate cars.
michael Pam.
pam Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.
michael Pam.
pam Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.
michael Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
pam I.
michael Excellent!
pam I was thinking that we.
michael Good work Pam.
pam But.
michael Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
stanley You can't be serious. You ran a woman over this morning.
michael Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
michael Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me. No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.
michael Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh. She looks like an angel.
kelly She looks awful.
michael No. OK, she always looks like that. That is not my fault.
jim I think she's awake.
michael No. She's in a coma.
nurse No.
michael OK. Meredith, Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
meredith At the same time.
michael Yeah.
stanley Hello Meredith.
meredith This is weird.
michael Brought you some balloons. Why don't we. here you go. Tie these up, cheer up your tubes. Oh! Shhhh. For God's sake!
kevin Whoa!
michael Nurse.
meredith No don't bother the nurse, just put it back in.
michael I am going to be sick. I'm gonna puke.
jim I wouldn't. I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
nurse What, what are you doing? Just gimme that.
meredith Thanks.
kevin 
phyllis Does it hurt terribly?
meredith No, it's not too bad. They have me on a lot of painkillers.
creed Oh really, what kind? Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet, Fentanyl, Oxycontin, Palladone? What.
meredith I have no idea.
creed Oh.
meredith Well it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time. I'll see you guys at the office.
michael Oh, OK. Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
meredith Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
michael Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
angela No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
michael Well, just shhhh. just just.
meredith You cracked my pelvis
michael Look, I just. I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
meredith You're not forgiven.
michael Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
pam Michael! Michael!
meredith 
michael Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.
angela Hey.
dwight Hey monkey.
angela Any problems?
dwight Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
angela What!?
dwight Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
angela Sprinkles.
dwight That was the sick one, right?
angela Uh-huh. But I thought she had more time.
dwight No.
angela Did she look. When you saw her how was she looking?
dwight Really dead. Like a. just a dead cat.
angela 
dwight So. Hey come on, don't be sad, just. OK. just. She's in a better place.
angela Alright.
dwight Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
angela 
pam It's gonna be OK.
michael OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just.
pam Michael, Angela's cat died.
michael Sprinkles?
angela 
michael Oh, sh. I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the p0rn, and then meredith with the accident, and then. Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
michael Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but. I'm. I am a little-stitious.
michael Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
oscar Like what?
michael Like park on it. Or dig up a body. Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
toby No, I did not violate an Indian burial ground. In fact I had some good luck recently, Alfredo's Pizza, picked my business card out of the basket, so. uh, I got a week of free pies.
pam That's cool.
toby Yeah.
michael Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
angela Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
dwight She's only a cat.
angela You never. you don't like them.
dwight Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
oscar dwight please!
michael Dwight, you haven't seen meredith yet, have you?
dwight No, I have not.
michael Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
dwight I do not respect her, but I will go.
michael Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
toby Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs.
michael Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
toby Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
michael Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
stanley I'm. um, Catholic.
michael OK.
darryl Presbyterian.
michael Alright.
pam Oh me too.
darryl Oh?
pam Same religion.
darryl Alright!
phyllis I'm a Lutheran and Bob's a Unitarian. It keeps things spicy.
angela That's why we're cursed.
creed I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower, but you make more money as a leader.
michael Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.
kelly That's Buddhist.
michael Are you sure?
kelly No.
michael What are you? IT Tech
guy Well if you're going to reduce my identity to my religion then I'm Sikh, but I also like Hip-hop and NPR, and I'm restoring a 1967 Corvette in my spare time.
michael OK, 1 Sikh, and.
dwight As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
dwight Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
meredith Don't pull any plugs.
intern How are you doing Ms. Palmer?
meredith Better.
intern Excellent.
dwight Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
intern Um. I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor, but.
dwight Pfft. Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
intern Ah, so uh. so that is where her uterus went. Um, Ms. Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?
meredith Yes. dwight here, trapped it in a bag against my head.
dwight Just doing my job.
intern It also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?
meredith And a rat. Separate occasions.
michael You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense. God is dead.
kelly If there was a God then ryan and I would be married by now.
michael Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just. the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah. the body of a porcupine.
jim I will do some research.
pam I can help you with that.
dwight So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
michael Oh God, Rabies?
dwight Mm-hmm.
michael I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
dwight No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
michael This place is so cursed.
dwight Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in. Lock jaw.
michael I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
jim Six of one, really.
michael Turns out meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like kevin Oh well, if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be. I thought they'd be good together, like PB&amp;J. pam Beasley and Jim. What a waste. What - A - Waste!
pam I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be. Trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
pam michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
michael Pro-Am.
pam Pro-Am race for the. They hung up.
michael A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.
stanley No, rabies. Babies would be a good idea. Can I put you down for a dime?
michael Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
stanley Zero.
michael Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. jan called this morning and pledged $500. 00.
andy Isn't that your money?
michael That. is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
phyllis Oh, it's coming.
michael Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
kevin Michael?
michael Yes.
kevin You cannot make me run.
michael OK.
kevin It is not a real charity. It's stupid Michael, and I'm not gonna do it.
michael Alright, alright.
kevin You didn't run for me.
michael Shhh.
kevin . when I thought I had skin cancer.
michael I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
kevin No.
michael OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields. And I was a peasant.
kevin I just don't want to run. I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
michael Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
andy I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So. I take precautions.
andy Hey Angela. Hey, um. I'm sorry about your cat.
angela This is Sprinkles. She was my best friend. I kept her going through countless ailments. I asked dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased. This is Halloween last year, just a couple of kittens out on the town.
angela Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
pam What's wrong?
angela I have this crazy thought, that I know is crazy. That maybe dwight killed my cat.
pam Hmm.
angela When I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen french fries had been clawed to shreds.
pam Ah.
angela Something's not right. The vet's doing an autopsy.
pam Angela, I'm sorry.
angela Did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
pam I'm more of a dog person.
angela 
jim So what's your strategy for this race?
pam Well I'm gonna start fast.
jim Mm-hmm.
pam Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
jim What?
pam Then I'm gonna end fast.
jim Why won't more people do that?
pam Cause they're just stupid.
jim What?
jim Oh, ah. No that's not. I mean that wasn't, ah.
pam Yeah. That was um.
jim I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh. How it looks like um. I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um. anything.
pam Yeah, I gave him a ride home because.
jim Right!
pam . We're dating.
jim Wow! There it is.
pam Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. Right?
jim It is going really great.
dwight Oww!
angela Shut up.
dwight You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
angela Oh, really?
dwight You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
angela I'm not depressed I'm in grief.
michael We have raised, almost $700. 00, most of it from me and Jan. Um. when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?
pam Well a giant check costs about $200. 00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but. What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?
michael Hmm. That's a tough decision. Um. I always imagined it with a giant check. So.
jim Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
pam Giant check it is.
jim Yeah.
michael Yep.
dwight Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
jim Bat birth control
dwight Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
michael You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
pam Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700. 00, or $500. 00 if we go with the giant check.
jim Which we are.
pam And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
michael What about a rabies nurse?
pam I don't think so.
jim You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
michael That's possible. Look into that.
jim Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah. oh actually more with tips.
dwight Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
michael Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
pam Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles.
michael Come in.
pam Hey.
michael Hey, hey, hey
pam Oh my God.
michael What are you doing?
pam You said come in!
michael No I didn't, just please don't.
pam Oh my God.
pam So I closed the door but the image of his.
jim Baquette.
pam . dangling participle.
jim Eww.
pam . still burned in my eyes.
jim I can imagine.
pam Come in.
michael May I enter the room?
pam Yes. Or come in.
michael See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
jim You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
michael Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
pam On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.
michael European offices are naked all the time.
pam They're so not.
michael Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so.
pam I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.
jim Gross.
michael That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
jim Alright.
pam They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on. or a funny coat.
jim Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?
jan OK, name please.
creed creed Bratton, 75 plus division.
jan You're over 75 years old?
creed 82 November first. How much is the prize money?
jan There's no prize money.
creed What, is any of this real?
michael Check that out. Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?
jan So I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
pam What? Look, no it was not.
jan I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, OK? So hands off.
michael OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves.
myth 3 Americans every year die from rabies.
fact 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three. too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something. darryl what are you doing.
darryl I'm giving him a peanut.
michael No, don't give him. just, did you hear anything I said?
darryl Look how happy he is.
michael He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? This is the reason we're here.
elizabeth Hello Michael.
michael Oh hey, I know you. Elizabeth?
elizabeth Yeah.
michael Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340. 00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
elizabeth Great.
michael You got it?
dwight Mm-hmm.
michael OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
michael Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.
dwight On your marks, get set.
michael Beow!
toby Hey!
michael On your left!
oscar You're doing great Michael, look at you go!
creed That's my boss! Yeah-ha baby!
michael I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.
stanley Oh yes I will work out today. I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
andy I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance.
pam Yeah. Oh we're in last place.
jim Oh, would you look at that.
pam Darn it.
jan Water? Water? Water babe?
michael No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water. solidarity!
jan michael that's irrational.
michael Rabies victims. have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So. least I could do.
andy Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.
creed Can we get another round?
waitress OK.
creed Thanks.
stanley So we've got what, another 20 minutes?
oscar More or less.
stanley Hmmm.
michael That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
dwight You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
michael Excellent! . Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
toby I'm makin' great time. Usually I have to take a bathroom break half way through a race like this, but not today.
jim Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?
pam I don't know I'm really committed to winning.
jim OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
pam Mmm. Yes.
jim That's what I thought.
pam Yeah.
jim Right. Let's do some good.
ryan for the cure. leave a message" ryan hangs up]
michael Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch.
andy Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.
kevin Back off me.
dwight How ya feeling, better?
angela No.
dwight Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
angela The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
dwight I am a farmer Angela.
angela What does that mean?
dwight OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
angela You did kill her!?
dwight I. I sang her, her favorite songs.
angela You put her in my freezer.
dwight It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
angela Well then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
dwight Well I'm not responsible for that!
angela You!
dwight Hey, Oww! It's OK.
angela It's OK.
dwight It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
angela It's nothing.
dwight It's fine. What?
angela How could you do that without telling me?
dwight I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
angela Cat Heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
dwight I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
angela You don't understand.
michael Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
dwight Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
angela Don't touch me Dwight!
pam You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8. 00.
jim Oh, and I get to carry it.
toby And the winner is toby Flenderson.
kelly Have a seat, I'll write it down.
toby Where are we?
kelly I dunno, like 5 kilometers from the office.
toby He couldn't have made it a circle?
michael I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.
jim . talk about it.
pam Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?
jim What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or.
michael I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just.
jim Well, you're probably dehydrated.
michael What do you want me to do Jim?
jim Glass of water would be a start.
michael No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and. they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't. you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
jim Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
pam I'm still having a nice day.
jim You are?
pam Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8. 00.
michael That's a good deal.
pam And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So. you don't really have to think about it too much.
michael Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
pam Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.
michael You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
pam I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
michael You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my pen1s. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this. GD 5k No, no!
michael Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.
meredith Hey Michael.
michael Hey Mer. How ya doing?
meredith Better.
michael It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
meredith I'm in because you hit me with your car. But I wanted to say, I heard you were trying really hard, so I'm not mad at you anymore.
michael Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. Wanna share?
meredith Sure.
michael I'm not really sick. Nah, I'm good.
