pam_beesly What's wrong Michael?
michael_scott I got gum in my hair.
pam_beesly You do.
michael_scott This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
dwight_schrute You've got a ton of dandruff.
michael_scott OK, let me be.
jim_halpert How'd you get gum in your hair?
michael_scott I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
jim_halpert But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
michael_scott Kill me... right now.
pam_beesly We have peanut butter in the kitchen.
michael_scott I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
jim_halpert Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
pam_beesly No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.
michael_scott Smells good.
dwight_schrute Taste good too.
michael_scott Oh don't. That's disgusting.
dwight_schrute Wow! Lot of calories.
michael_scott Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.
dwight_schrute Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
michael_scott
michael_scott I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.
oscar_martinez I am livid, Absolutely livid.
angela_martin It's ridiculous.
ryan_howard Yes, I'm having the Scranton branch come in on one Saturday so they can re-enter sales that they made on the phone as sales that were made by the website which they should have done in the first place, if the website had been working.
ryan_howard My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
jim_halpert Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?
ryan_howard Love it. Go.
jim_halpert Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
ryan_howard I can tell you thought about this a lot, I appreciate that.
jim_halpert Thanks.
ryan_howard David Wallace does too. You told him all about this at the Christmas party, right?
jim_halpert Did I? I don't...
ryan_howard You did. Yeah.
jim_halpert Hmm.
ryan_howard Watch your back Jim. I'm just kidding.
michael_scott Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...
ryan_howard Ok thanks Michael.
michael_scott Yeah.
ryan_howard I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
dwight_schrute Question.
ryan_howard Dwight.
dwight_schrute Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
ryan_howard This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
stanley_hudson I don't like when my clients call me to help them use the website, I'm not seeing commissions on that.
ryan_howard I hear you Stanley, that is a great observation. Problems like that will not happen when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2 point O.
stanley_hudson When will that be?
ryan_howard TBD. Phyllis?
phyllis_vance Did the police solve the problem with the...
ryan_howard Yes, yes they did, yes they did.
ryan_howard Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
dwight_schrute I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
jim_halpert Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
ryan_howard It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election; all of it is happening in our virtual paper store.
jim_halpert And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?"
creed_bratton I don't get the big fuss here, I like the site.
kelly_kapoor If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
ryan_howard Do you have a question Kelly?
kelly_kapoor Yeah I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?
michael_scott Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
michael_scott Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.
ryan_howard You too.
michael_scott Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.
ryan_howard Michael let me go. Let me go Michael.
michael_scott Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
ryan_howard Na.
michael_scott Na?
ryan_howard Sorry man.
michael_scott Well you tried.
ryan_howard But seriously, you should see the girls I meet at clubs in the city.
michael_scott Yeah.
ryan_howard Unreal.
michael_scott They sound great.
ryan_howard Bye everyone. Stay real Scranton, alright. Peace.
michael_scott Would you have s*x with Meredith?
jim_halpert What?
michael_scott Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
jim_halpert I'm gonna go to my desk.
michael_scott Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...
jim_halpert I know.
michael_scott Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
jim_halpert I can't.
michael_scott Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
jim_halpert I'm not single.
michael_scott Who you dating?
jim_halpert Pam.
michael_scott That's still going on?
michael_scott Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
andy_bernard Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
angela_martin I'm right here.
dwight_schrute No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
michael_scott Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
angela_martin We get it.
michael_scott I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
dwight_schrute With s*x!
michael_scott That's... I, I think that...
jim_halpert You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.
jim_halpert So I caught everyone before they left and I told them my idea, and they loved it. Because this is a group that respects good ideas... the one time a year they hear one.
michael_scott Ryan's assistant told us that he would be at this club this evening. It is called Prerogative.
michael_scott Place is packed.
dwight_schrute Fire hazard.
michael_scott Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
dwight_schrute Women look like white slaves.
michael_scott No, they're just hotties.
ryan_howard I don't know man, when you think about it, Cabo's really the third world. I don't go to a place like that to see more poverty you know. You go there to get some glamour.
michael_scott Hey.
ryan_howard Michael.
michael_scott Hey!
ryan_howard What are you doing here?
michael_scott Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
ryan_howard That is so awesome man!
michael_scott Alright!
ryan_howard And you brought this guy!
michael_scott Yeah.
ryan_howard Aww!
michael_scott Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.
ryan_howard I know it's you guys.
michael_scott Ok.
ryan_howard I'm so psyched you're here!
michael_scott Well.
ryan_howard Woooo!
michael_scott Alright!
ryan_howard Let's get a drink.
michael_scott Let's do it!
jim_halpert Thanks a lot guys, Good job.
kevin_malone Later.
jim_halpert Nice job everybody. Great work.
stanley_hudson Did you not tell the security guard we were working late?
jim_halpert Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
pam_beesly You can't, I locked the office from the inside when we left.
stanley_hudson Perfect, you guys worked together on this one. If I'm not in my bath with a glass of red wine in an hour, you're both dead.
pam_beesly There is a master key and a spare key for the office. Dwight has them both. When I asked, "What if you die Dwight, how will we get into the office?" He said, "If I'm dead, you guys have been dead for weeks."
ryan_howard Guys, I want you to meet a really good friend of mine, this is Troy.
michael_scott Hey, nice to meet you.
troy_undercook Hey, how ya doing?
dwight_schrute Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
ryan_howard Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
dwight_schrute No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
ryan_howard Bottle service ya'll?
michael_scott Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
cocktail_waitress We don't serve food here.
michael_scott Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
dwight_schrute Do you live in a regular sized house?
ryan_howard Yeah. He's a normal guy, he's cool.
jim_halpert You really don't have his phone number?
pam_beesly I told you, I have the number that rings here. Do you want that number?
toby_flenderson I might have it in here.
pam_beesly Aw! That's great Toby.
toby_flenderson It's so random that I have it.
pam_beesly Toby, you're the best.
toby_flenderson When I put it in I thought it would be a waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.
jim_halpert Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
toby_flenderson No.
jim_halpert It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
andy_bernard Yes, it's Eddie.
jim_halpert It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
creed_bratton Hank, his name is Hank.
jim_halpert No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
phyllis_vance Elliot.
oscar_martinez Elliot!
jim_halpert Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
ryan_howard Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?
dwight_schrute Good.
ryan_howard This guy owns his own beet farm.
troy_undercook Insane.
dwight_schrute Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
ryan_howard Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
dwight_schrute They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
ryan_howard Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
dwight_schrute You've already been several times.
ryan_howard Yeah.
dwight_schrute Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
ryan_howard I don't know, maybe.
dwight_schrute I'll order you some cranberry juice.
ryan_howard With vodka, you're the best.
dwight_schrute Do you have powers?
jim_halpert Oh thank you Hank. You are a lifesaver, Hank. Appreciate it. Alright, so Hank is gonna come down here and he's gonna let us all out. He said it should just be under an hour, so... we did it.
oscar_martinez We should all make sure to give him a big tip this Christmas.
toby_flenderson Sorry guys, but I don't think I tipped him for last year's.
angela_martin Yeah, neither did I.
phyllis_vance Jim was supposed to collect it.
jim_halpert Yup...
kevin_malone Way to go, man.
kelly_kapoor Now he's never gonna come.
andy_bernard By a show of hands, who thinks we're a better couple than Jim and Pam?
pam_beesly Phyllis.
michael_scott I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting "Back to the Future." "Back" because it's on my back and "Future" because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie.
young_club_girl in Club I've never heard of that movie.
michael_scott Back to the Future? Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
young_club_girl in Club How old are you?

pam_beesly Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.
oscar_martinez Why?
pam_beesly I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday.
toby_flenderson More like "Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday." I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now.
michael_scott Those girls really wailed on you bad.
ryan_howard Why wouldn't they let me dance?
michael_scott Well...
troy_undercook OK I gotta go. Do not take him to a hospital.
michael_scott Pretty weird.
tall_girl_1 Girl #1 You have to go with me.

jim_halpert Cleaning people. Oscar. OK, so all you need to do is explain to them what happened, 'cause I think they can help us.
oscar_martinez Why are you assuming they only speak Spanish?

dwight_schrute I got sofa. I got sofa.
michael_scott Dwight, I'm the boss.
dwight_schrute I got floor.
michael_scott Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.
dwight_schrute Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
ryan_howard No.
michael_scott Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.
dwight_schrute It's a lullaby.
michael_scott Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
ryan_howard No. Guys, I think my friend Troy might have a drug problem. What do I do?
dwight_schrute I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
michael_scott Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.
ryan_howard Guys, I'm going to sleep. You can leave the light on if you want, but please stop talking, OK?
dwight_schrute OK. Good night Ryan.
michael_scott Best night ever.
michael_scott Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys.
hank Son of a bitch.
