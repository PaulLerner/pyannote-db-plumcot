oscar Oh, for God's sake.
oscar Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That's it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet.
erin Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don't. And I don't. But I am so excited to be a part of it.
andy After you my good sir.
dwight No, I insist.
andy I insist.
jim The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on robert California. for the manager position. Who took one look around and left. He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO. CEO. her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill. And he chose.
andy I. it's unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice's first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, "I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer. " Smart, right?
kelly (planking on top of cabinet] Very smart.
andy Uh, this has got to stop.
kelly I can't get down.
dwight K. Kevin!
dwight Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great.
dwight K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?
pam I don't think I should.
jim Oh, yeah. Pregnant.
pam Right here. Little Michael Scott-
jim No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
pam Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.
angela Look, it's a ‘Little Pregs' and ‘Big Pregs'
pam Wait, when did we start calling it that-
angela Isn't it amazing, the difference in our sizes?
pam Well, I am a few months ahead of you.
angela I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And pam is having a child with Jim. the great salesman.
dwight Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl.
darryl I'm lifting.
darryl Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin' much better. This soda. This is mine.
stanley It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt.
stanley I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I'm telling someone how to do somethin'. I go on with a long description and then I say, "and shove it up your butt. " It's stupid, but it's my thing now.
jim No one should be planking at all.
andy Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
dwight Say no more.
dwight Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. ‘Specially with me around.
jim You watching that commercial again? Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?
pam Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.
jim He's got a bank vault. That's a start.
pam Not enough though.
jim The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange.
erin Here we go.
robert Hello.
erin robert California. Let's have a conversation.
robert Describe your day so far.
erin Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-
robert And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It's a waste of your time. That's how every day's begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.
erin Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I've been doing this thing-
andy Hey, Robert. We have that 9
 30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.
andy First item on the
agenda can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. robert California, what does he think of me? Don't know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.
erin Pam, pam. Psst. Pam.
pam Jim.
jim Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. Okay. What is this?
andy The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?
robert What are your thoughts.
andy Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?
dwight What are you looking at?
jim It's, it's nothing.
dwight It can't be nothing.
phyllis Yeah, it can't be nothing.
jim It's just a list of our names, split into two columns.
stanley What?
jim Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
erin No.
jim No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
dwight Nice catch.
pam If he comes out, distract him.
kevin We need a warning signal.
jim We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
kevin We do.
jim I promise you, we don't need a warning-
kevin WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
phyllis Ahhh!
dwight Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
phyllis Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
dwight . 2, 3!
phyllis Thanks guys.
dwight Okay, which side of the list am I on?
jim Left.
dwight Yes!
jim Why are you- How do you know?
andy Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.
jim Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert's notebook.
pam He left it at reception and we photocopied it.
andy Oh, okay. I don't want any part of this.
pam Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna fire.
jim Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists dwight used to make.
dwight This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an ‘Alive' situation. No. that can't be it.
andy I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.
jim I don't think it's-
pam ‘Scuse me?
dwight Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider.
angela Did you guys figure it out?
andy We couldn't crack it.
stanley Go in there and just ask the man what it means.
andy He'll know that we looked at his private notebook.
phyllis C'mon, just say you saw the list by accident.
andy I'm already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it's starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.
phyllis Yeah, that's all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?
robert Yes, for god's sake Andy. Yes, come in.
andy What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.
robert Great. Thank you.
andy And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.
robert What is this?
andy It's a photocopy from your notebook.
robert You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.
andy No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.
robert Ah, please. Here's what it is. It's a doodle.
andy What?
robert Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don't you think? Well, I doodle too, but I'm not an artist. So I draw words and lists.
andy That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?
robert Might as well have been sketching a cube. . push;
andy Okay. Robert's in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?
meredith Maybe we're s'posed to do it with people in our group.
jim That's not it.
meredith People in the other group.
jim Mmum, still wrong.
andy Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?
stanley Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ‘em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!
andy Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.
kevin I know! It's alphabetical.
everyone No.
dwight No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list. ATTACK!
jim Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!
andy Dwight!
meredith Hey!
kevin Warning! Warning! Warning!
robert I'd like to invite the following people to join me for
lunch Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.
dwight That's great. Let's do this guys.
jim Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
pam I love you so much.
jim Hey. It's nothing. Alright? I'll text you when we get there. Let you know what's going on.
pam Okay.
jim Nope. No dog video.
pam Okay.
jim Okay. See you guys.
andy Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!
robert Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?
jim Uhhh, the street?
robert Sesame street.
jim Oh, I didn't know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
robert Elmo, god's sake, it's the Elmo era.
jim Right.
robert Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn't you agree.
jim Yeah, she does like Elmo.
oscar Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.
phyllis Completely.
darryl Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.
kevin The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.
toby I should not be here. I'm in the- I was in the wrong- I'm- I'm sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.
andy Great group! Pizza party!
kelly How is this a pizza party?
andy Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.
kelly Yeah, well, that's just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.
andy Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?
stanley What's that?
andy Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.
stanley That's pizza.
pam That's regular pizza.
dwight You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question. what made you pick this group?
robert I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
dwight Okay!
everyone Awww.
phyllis Well, what about the other guys.
dwight Losers.
robert No.
dwight C'mon.
robert I don't- I don't wanna say-
dwight C'mon, c'mon.
robert No, no.
dwight C'mon.
robert Ha, I guess I think they're losers.
dwight Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
robert Probably shouldn't have said that.
andy Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.
pam Oh, text from Jim. "This is getting very weird. Will explain later. "
pam Oh, text from Kevin.
meredith "Suck it losers. "
ryan Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn't the fact that I'm in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!
pam I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, "Who's that receptionist? I like her. " Now I'm just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you're like, "Oh, loser. "
andy C'mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?
pam Oh. Oh God.
kelly Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?
angela It was excellent.
darryl Good times.
andy Yeah?
dwight Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
kevin I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone.
jim Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?
pam Yeah, I'm fine.
kevin Loser. Losers.
meredith Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It'll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.
andy When I was a salesman I could just be like "Not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob. " Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.
andy Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier.
robert I never said that.
andy Thank you. Great. Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you're talking about?
andy Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?
robert Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I'll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you're a winner. If I didn't, I don't. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.
phyllis Whew, well. I guess that's that.
andy No. No, no.
erin Andy, don't go in there!
andy I'm going in there.
andy I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.
robert I'm not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don't use ballpoint pens.
andy Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley. you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?
robert I did not know about the sales figures.
andy meredith Palmer. Supplier relations. The word "no" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
dwight Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
jim Shhh.
andy erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.
erin I like my new group. I liked my old group.
robert Are we done?
andy Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we're gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.
robert You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?
andy Yes, I do.
robert And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.
andy I don't care.
andy Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.
stanley We get that every year.
andy Well, you got it this year too.
phyllis Good night, Andy.
andy Night.
angela Bye.
oscar Good night Andy.
dwight Good night.
andy Night.
jim Alright, I'm gonna go warm up the car.
pam Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?
pam Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but- I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No. It's wonderful. I'm gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.
