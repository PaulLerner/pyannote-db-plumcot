andy_bernard Ah, what else? I've seen Dirty Dancing like, ten times. Breaks my heart every time, you know?
all@ Whoa!
pam_beesly Andy.
andy_bernard That Swayze sure can dance dirty.
phyllis_vance Don't you have any sunblock?
andy_bernard No, Walter J has been hoarding it. You want to worry about a part of my body, worry about my eyes. They're like two flaming meatballs in my skull.
erin_hannon Last week Andy set sail for the Bahamas to sell his family's boat, and he took his brother, but not me. I was kind of sad at first, but then I remembered that Bob Marley song -- No, woman. No cry.
andy_bernard Check this out. Keeps my hair out of my stare, also helps me combat the glare bear. That's what I call the sun now.
darryl_philbin Andy, it's Darryl. Take your drawers off your head.
andy_bernard What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!
erin_hannon Oh, Andy, was.. was that your drinking water?
andy_bernard Yeah, it was. That's okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out. Ow!
all@ Oh!
andy_bernard Ah! That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know?
darryl_philbin He's been sailing for two days.
andy_bernard I will leave you with this. The image of a man and his boat. Burn this into your brains.
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard No. No! Nooo!
erin_hannon Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute. Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
state_senator_rob_lipton Well, I have some very exciting news.
dwight_schrute And you didn't call Jim - that seems significant.
jim_halpert Hi, David.
state_senator_rob_lipton Jim, good! You should hear this too.
dwight_schrute No, he shouldn't.
jim_halpert Go ahead David, I'm listening.
dwight_schrute Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don't know where I'd put you.
state_senator_rob_lipton Guys, listen, this is big news. The Scranton White Pages just got in contact with my office the day before yesterday. They've apparently just dropped the supplier they've been with for the last ten years. .
dwight_schrute The White Pages.
dwight_schrute The White Pages Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There's a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing "the White Whale". Look at all that sweet blubber.
state_senator_rob_lipton Look, we need our top salesman running point on this and Dwight, that is you.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where's Stanley?
erin_hannon He's in the bathroom.
dwight_schrute Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
erin_hannon Of course.
dwight_schrute Yeah! Okay. Hey David, I'm back.
erin_hannon Eat it Stanley!
dwight_schrute So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
state_senator_rob_lipton No, I spoke with the receptionist over there. It's someone new but she didn't catch her name.
dwight_schrute Her name?
phyllis_vance No, hey, Dwight shouldn't...
dwight_schrute Shhh! Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
state_senator_rob_lipton Good luck!
dwight_schrute Good luck to you.
phyllis_vance Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them.
dwight_schrute That is a damnable lie. I love women.
phyllis_vance Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her ‘gy-na' for your entire meeting.
nellie_bertram Ew. That's not good.
phyllis_vance Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
dwight_schrute ‘Gy-na' said that?
phyllis_vance Guys, we can't let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
meredith_palmer Hey remember that week in the 90's when we got bagels?
creed_bratton I miss Clinton.
pam_beesly Can you go instead?
jim_halpert I can't. I have the thing.
jim_halpert I have this conference call today with this company in Philly that I'm helping start. Ah, first board meeting. Also, the first time I've ever been excited about work. So, that feels... wrong.
pete_miller Okay, call down. It's just me, not Tom Selleck.
Guys#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 in breakroom
kevin_malone Nice!
pete_miller Toby got us all to participate in Movember. It's a charity for prostate cancer. You pledge money and then you grow a mustache for the month of November.
clark So, this is how we look now. I hope you like being turned on all the time.
darryl_philbin Daaaaamn! It just keeps on coming, huh?
toby_flenderson I have very fertile hair glands.
toby_flenderson I am so glad I got all of the dudes to do Movember. We have the dopest time back in the annex.
clark God!
toby_flenderson We even go to lunch, pick up babes.
toby_flenderson Smile if you love men's prostates.
angela_martin Hi.
oscar_martinez Hi.
angela_martin Spring cleaning?
oscar_martinez More like fall cleaning.
angela_martin I think the senator is having an affair.
oscar_martinez This doesn't... I'm sorry. Wha... what?
angela_martin I think the senator is having an affair.
oscar_martinez I literally have nightmares in which what just happened happens. I wake up in a sweat. And then I make Angela's husband spoon me back to bed.
angela_martin When he comes home in the morning, he has this secret little smile.
oscar_martinez Oh, I'm sure ...that's nothing.
angela_martin And he's always at the yoga studio. He never misses the noon class - it's Hot Yoga with Blake.
oscar_martinez Angela, Blake's also a guy's name so he... may be spending his afternoons with a guy named Blake. So nothing to worry about. Huh. Blake. Who is Blake?
angela_martin I don't know.
oscar_martinez I just never heard about the senator and yoga...
angela_martin Right.
oscar_martinez From you. I'm sure it's probably nothing. But what's with the yoga already?
angela_martin Right?
oscar_martinez And Blake! All right Angela, calm down! We need to go check this out.
angela_martin What?
oscar_martinez Angela, I'll go with you.
phyllis_vance So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client.
dwight_schrute Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
pam_beesly You've got this Schrute.
phyllis_vance Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
dwight_schrute Hello.
erin_hannon Hello.
dwight_schrute May I please speak to your boss?
phyllis_vance No, she is the boss.
erin_hannon I am? Hmm.. Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?
dwight_schrute Okay, this isn't working for me, ‘cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
erin_hannon He's absolutely right. I'm really struggling.
pam_beesly Oh, I'll be the buyer.
dwight_schrute
pam_beesly Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
dwight_schrute I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
phyllis_vance No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
dwight_schrute I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over.
pam_beesly Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
dwight_schrute I thought it went great.
nellie_bertram I have uh, written down a few questions. One, have you ever killed a woman? Two, how many women have you killed? Please, sir, will you not kill me?
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Okay lets get started.
jim_halpert Yeah, I'm here. Are we all on?
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Uh,, well you're the only one ‘on' - we're all here.
jim_halpert Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
kevin_malone That's the winter season., three months.
jim_halpert I uh, I have some ideas, actually...
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Are you at your office right now?
jim_halpert Uh yeah. Trust me, I'd rather be with you guys.
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Uh, yeah, that sounded kinda spooky-sexy, over here Halpert.
jim_halpert Oh, Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Whoa. I think there's been a bit of a mistake. We're trying to reach Jim Halpert, not Batman.
jim_halpert Um, you know what? I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Uh, yeah...
jim_halpert I'm gonna try a different spot. Okay?
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Okay, yeah.
jim_halpert Okay, I'll call you right back.
kevin_malone What's happening in three months?
pam_beesly Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
dwight_schrute Yes.
pam_beesly Okay, well you have to show us.
dwight_schrute That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all.
pam_beesly Huh. Uh huh.
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
pam_beesly A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
dwight_schrute Kind of.
pam_beesly Nellie, why don't you tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you're listening.
nellie_bertram Well, we were in the warehouse, where we were discussing a mural that I've commissioned Pam to paint there. We were talking color schemes and the major themes we want to hit. Children of the world, coming together, cutting down trees to make paper. But not in a child labor-y way.
erin_hannon It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
dwight_schrute I am a person.
erin_hannon Yes.
nellie_bertram And then we thought we'd ... I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he's laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
dwight_schrute That's a bit extreme.
nellie_bertram No, I'm sorry but that is true.
meredith_palmer He's screwed. They're meeting in less than an hour.
phyllis_vance Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage okay? You're the woman, I'm the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
dwight_schrute Okay, I'm a woman. I'm a woman. Good?
phyllis_vance Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
dwight_schrute Hello.
phyllis_vance Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute! They could be models.
dwight_schrute Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my v*g1n*.
meredith_palmer Booo! Weird.
nellie_bertram No.
phyllis_vance Okay, yeah. This is a lost cause. It's hopeless.
pam_beesly Ten years ago, I didn't care if Dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor. But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I'm like, that poor gimp is somebody's child.
pam_beesly You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
dwight_schrute Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders!
pam_beesly Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
dwight_schrute I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
pam_beesly Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber.
dwight_schrute Okay, I can do that.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
dwight_schrute He used to fight dogs.
pam_beesly Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
dwight_schrute Little of this, little of that.
angela_martin Which one is the instructor? There all fatties.
oscar_martinez Angela! Angela. There.
angela_martin Where?
oscar_martinez On the stairs. Stay calm. Stay down. Oh, so wait. Blake is a her.
angela_martin Oh my God! She's so stunningly tiny! She's like a petite double zero, for sure. For sure! Holy cow! Look at what they're doing.
oscar_martinez She's repositioning his hips for downward facing dog.
angela_martin I've heard of this - dog style. Oh wait. Oh look Oscar, Thumbelina has a boyfriend! And he has a ponytail - ew. I'd like to see that run for office. Oscar, you were right. I had nothing to be worried about. Thank you. Let's go.
oscar_martinez Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
angela_martin Ow.
oscar_martinez Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up, hold on. Shh. Hold on. Sorry. Look.
pete_miller
toby_flenderson This is fun. You know? I mean, this is fun.
jim_halpert What I was saying is the genius of Air Jordan was not in the market saturation, it was in --
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 It was in what? Jim, we're having a lot of trouble hearing you.
jim_halpert The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the...
hank Hey! Are those skateboarders back?
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Jim? Jim, are you there?
hank Where are they?
jim_halpert It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
meredith_palmer Who was messing with my van?
jim_halpert Nobody!
Business_partner#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Jordan wore them for nobody? We're not following you, Halpert.
jim_halpert No, no, no.
hank This ends now!
mom Have a seat. Um, she will be right in.
pam_beesly Oh, great. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mind telling me her name? I realized we don't have it.
mom Uh... um she'll be right in.
pam_beesly Okay, great.
dwight_schrute Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
pam_beesly Oh my God. It's Jan.
dwight_schrute Oh, dear God in heaven.
pam_beesly Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.
jan_levinson You son of a bitch. You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
pam_beesly Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?
pam_beesly Forget everything we taught you. Hey, Jan! It's so great to see you.
jan_levinson Where's Wallace?
pam_beesly What?
jan_levinson I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
dwight_schrute Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.
pam_beesly Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.
jan_levinson Molly! David Wallace is in Vermont.
molly Oh, my God. Um, I talked to his assistant. And I guess it did get a little confusing ‘cause you said not to tell anyone your name. And then also, those bluetooths are very hard to hear with. I know you love the way they look, but Tom never had us use them...
jan_levinson Molly. I am not Tom. I am Jan.
molly I'm so sorry Jan.
jan_levinson I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing?
dwight_schrute Listening.
jan_levinson Stop.
dwight_schrute Sorry.
jan_levinson Stop that.
dwight_schrute Okay.
pam_beesly So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give?
jan_levinson No, I do.
pam_beesly But not to us.
jan_levinson Insightful, Pam.
pam_beesly You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us.
dwight_schrute Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back.
pam_beesly What?
jan_levinson Pam?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jan_levinson I'm a very busy woman, so...
pam_beesly Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?
jan_levinson Fine. I will show you one... slide show.
pete_miller Erin, did this call...
erin_hannon Uh!
pete_miller What?
erin_hannon Sorry, I uh, just saw your face.
pete_miller Oh, I'm sorry. It's for the thing.
erin_hannon I know. That's great. It just - it makes it look like there's an eyebrow in the middle of your face.
pete_miller Wow.
erin_hannon A handsome eyebrow, but, um... it makes your mouth look like an eye socket... which isn't bad.
pete_miller Uh-huh.
erin_hannon But um, you look like a cyclops whose eye... fell out... Which is great. It's such a great cause.
pete_miller Yeah.
erin_hannon
jan_levinson Mommy, you're a princess. Mommy, you're a superstar. Mommy you're the greatest. How can I ever fill your sho-o-o-es?
pam_beesly Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.
jan_levinson Aw.
pam_beesly And it is so cute how she signs her name.
jan_levinson Well, that -- that was -- that was me too.
pam_beesly Oh, okay. It's just that's how Cece does it with the backwards ‘E's.
jan_levinson Cece can't spell her name.
pam_beesly Oh, actually she can.
jan_levinson Well, it's not really much of a comparison, is it? I mean, "Cece" is two letters and "Astrid" is... I mean, there's even some adults who -- who -- who can't spell it.
pam_beesly Of course.
jan_levinson Can you spell it? Try to spell it, Pam.
pam_beesly Um... "A"... "X"? I don't -- you got me.
jan_levinson Don't patronize me.
pam_beesly I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better.
angela_martin Okay, we should go now. Let's go.
oscar_martinez Just wait. Just a minute. Just watch.
angela_martin Wait. Why are you... Oh. are you getting your jollies right now? Can't get enough of the show? Your jollies are all on fire --
oscar_martinez Please. It's Robert who's enjoying it.
angela_martin What?
oscar_martinez This could be the affair that you're scared of. Politicians are wonderful liars. You never know who they really are. But uh, he's probably not gay. He's straight. He's straight, so...
pam_beesly Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?
jan_levinson No.
dwight_schrute Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I've got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
pam_beesly Oh, my God.
clark Where's the Quizno's?
dwight_schrute You're the Quizno's. Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
jan_levinson I -- I --
dwight_schrute Hmm?
jan_levinson I don't recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
pam_beesly Okay, you do not have to do this.
clark Do what? Get into sales? That's what I want.
dwight_schrute He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
jan_levinson Will you uh, you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
dwight_schrute Very good.
jan_levinson Do you have a valid passport?
jim_halpert Jim Halpert.
Colin#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Hey, it's Colin.
jim_halpert Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
Colin#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 I know. Don't worry about it.
jim_halpert
Colin#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 It's just... it's not totally working.
jim_halpert Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don't worry. I'll figure it out.
Colin#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode07 Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this.
jim_halpert Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
angela_martin Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
oscar_martinez I don't know, Angela. I'm dehydrated. Maybe... You heard me wrong. We should just go.
angela_martin Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
oscar_martinez He's making a phone call.
angela_martin Oh. Oh.
oscar_martinez
pam_beesly Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
molly Thanks. Okay.
dwight_schrute Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
pam_beesly Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
dwight_schrute Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
pam_beesly That's a license number?
dwight_schrute That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
pam_beesly Oh. Why me?
dwight_schrute Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It's like air to you people. Ugh, God.
