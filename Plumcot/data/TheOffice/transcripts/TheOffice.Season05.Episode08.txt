angela_martin Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
kevin_malone Yes.
dwight_schrute Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
jim_halpert So why did you come in here?
dwight_schrute To socialize. And inform.
michael_scott Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
ryan_howard You're taking two?
kelly_kapoor Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
michael_scott Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
kelly_kapoor Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
michael_scott Heh, okay, weirdo.
jim_halpert Why is that, why is that weird?
michael_scott She said she was going to give it to him right now.
jim_halpert She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
michael_scott Yeah, they used to.
jim_halpert Toby works here again.
michael_scott Oh, can you imagine?
jim_halpert Oh no.
michael_scott Uhhgh.
jim_halpert You don't know.
michael_scott I don't know. What?
jim_halpert You should probably just meander back there; take a look. See if he's, see if he's back.
michael_scott Hmmm, dare I? You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake. Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex.
toby_flenderson Hi, Micha-
michael_scott NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
michael_scott Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid... tan. No.
dwight_schrute He looks great.
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute Well rested.
michael_scott He looks worse.
david_wallace Michael, is everyone okay?
michael_scott Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
david_wallace I don't understand, is anyone hurt?
michael_scott Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
david_wallace Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
michael_scott Yes.
david_wallace All in caps. Do you know what 911 means?
michael_scott I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
david_wallace Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
michael_scott I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
dwight_schrute Also, it's icky back there.
michael_scott That's true. People say it's icky.
david_wallace Okay, I have to go.
michael_scott David, wait.
david_wallace No.
michael_scott Is there no way we can get rid of him?
david_wallace Not without cause, Michael.
michael_scott I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.
david_wallace You have to get along with Toby.
michael_scott No.
david_wallace Yep.
michael_scott I don't.
david_wallace Goodbye, Michael.
michael_scott Don't do that.
pam_beesly Oh, come on! Do you see this? Disgusting.
andy_bernard So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
jim_halpert Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that.
andy_bernard Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle.
jim_halpert That's really not cool.
andy_bernard Kaaw!
kevin_malone So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
jim_halpert Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
jim_halpert Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. She's gonna love it. Right?
jim_halpert Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
andy_bernard Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle? You're in for a spanking my friend. Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
phyllis_vance Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic.
jim_halpert Oh thanks, Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Where's your place?
jim_halpert Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave? By the quarry?
phyllis_vance Ohhh...
creed_bratton Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
jim_halpert Definitely we should.
oscar_martinez "To whoever made the microwave mess the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance. By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter. Sincerely, disappointed."
andy_bernard That is just obnoxious.
oscar_martinez No kidding.
pam_beesly Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note?
oscar_martinez The note. So "holier than thou".
angela_martin Hmm, I liked it.
pam_beesly Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
andy_bernard No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
meredith_palmer Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
pam_beesly Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
meredith_palmer Yeh, they're rich.
michael_scott You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
toby_flenderson Well thanks Michael.
michael_scott You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.
toby_flenderson Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
michael_scott So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.
toby_flenderson Well, um, it was amazing. It really was, thanks for asking. Um the beaches were pristine...
michael_scott Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
toby_flenderson ...and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
michael_scott Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?
toby_flenderson It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
michael_scott I bet, for you.
toby_flenderson And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.
michael_scott Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
toby_flenderson Are you all right, Michael?
michael_scott Yeah, I am. I am.
michael_scott I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
michael_scott Okay, just summarize.
dwight_schrute Okay, fireable offenses include workplace violence and sexual harassment.
michael_scott That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
dwight_schrute I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.
michael_scott Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.
dwight_schrute Okay
michael_scott What are you doing?
dwight_schrute I am the bait.
michael_scott For what?
dwight_schrute Men find me desirable.
michael_scott No, no, no.
dwight_schrute Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
michael_scott You're the bait for Toby?
dwight_schrute Mmhmm.
michael_scott No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.
dwight_schrute Men find me desirable.
michael_scott Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
pam_beesly When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that.
jim_halpert Mmhmm, yeah.
pam_beesly Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
jim_halpert Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
pam_beesly Are you inching away from me?
jim_halpert No.
pam_beesly Reach your arms out.
jim_halpert I'm always this close.
michael_scott Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
jim_halpert Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
michael_scott Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
pam_beesly What do you need, Michael?
michael_scott Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?
michael_scott Good. N-no no no, don't.
pam_beesly "Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. I'm too shy to tell you that I love you."
michael_scott Pam. Pam, you gave me your word.
ryan_howard You did that for me?
kelly_kapoor Mmhmm.
ryan_howard Are you happy you did?
toby_flenderson Hey guys that's really inappropriate.
ryan_howard What's up?
michael_scott Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
ryan_howard Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
michael_scott Toby can I see those? Ooh. What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?
dwight_schrute Those are fighting words.
michael_scott You mad? You mad at me?
dwight_schrute I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
michael_scott Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
dwight_schrute Hmmm?
michael_scott Huh? He might do it...
kelly_kapoor Punch him, Toby!
michael_scott I dare you to. Come on.
dwight_schrute Come on. Baaah!
michael_scott What's the matter... haaaww!
dwight_schrute Hit him! Hit him, Chicken.
ryan_howard Yeah, punch him.
michael_scott Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
dwight_schrute Ryan. Come on, man?
michael_scott No do it, do it. I dare you.
dwight_schrute Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
michael_scott Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon...
toby_flenderson I'm not going to punch you, Michael.
dwight_schrute Are you really not going to punch him?
toby_flenderson No, why would I punch you?
michael_scott Son of a bitch.
ryan_howard You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man.
dwight_schrute I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
michael_scott Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.
dwight_schrute There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
michael_scott What's that?
dwight_schrute Frame him, for using drugs.
michael_scott Frame him?
dwight_schrute Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
michael_scott I've never framed a man before, have you?
dwight_schrute Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
michael_scott Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
michael_scott Hello. I've seen you guys around. I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing? Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here? I need to purchase something.
stanley_hudson Refrigeration guy A fridge?
michael_scott No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
stanley_hudson Refrigeration guy What?
michael_scott Grass, weed?
leo What makes you think we'd have weed?
michael_scott I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.
stanley_hudson Refrigeration Guy Hey, just hold on one second.
michael_scott I'm not wearing a wire, so...
leo Why would you even say that?
stanley_hudson Refrigeration Guy Hey, that's gonna be 500 dollars.
michael_scott How much? How many pounds is it?
stanley_hudson Refrigeration Guy It's- it's two pounds. I'm losing money on this man just, give me the money. Alright, walk away.
leo Walk away.
stanley_hudson Refrigeration Guy Walk away.
ryan_howard Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
pam_beesly Thank you.
ryan_howard I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
pam_beesly I know, can you believe it?
ryan_howard Yeah, it's crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
pam_beesly I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
ryan_howard Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me. I would just make it worse.
pam_beesly How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
ryan_howard I--- I would find a way.
pam_beesly You've seen things cleaned before though, right?
ryan_howard I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I... I, uh...
kelly_kapoor Hi, Michael.
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot...
dwight_schrute Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon.
policeman_1 Officer 1 Hi, we received a call?
pam_beesly I don't know anything about that.
policeman_1 Officer 1 We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation.
pam_beesly Here?
dwight_schrute Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.
creed_bratton Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
michael_scott Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on.
dwight_schrute Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
toby_flenderson Hey, what is this?
dwight_schrute Search his things.
policeman_1 Officer 2 Sir, can you step away from your desk please?
toby_flenderson Why?
policeman_1 Officer 2 Sir, please step away from your desk.
toby_flenderson Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this.
dwight_schrute They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
toby_flenderson Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
michael_scott Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
toby_flenderson Don't search my stuff.
policeman_1 Officer 1 Sir?
toby_flenderson I have a reasonable right to privacy.
dwight_schrute Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
toby_flenderson Michael!
michael_scott Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?
policeman_1 Officer 1 Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?
toby_flenderson Oh my God!
michael_scott No, no no no... No, no.
toby_flenderson That was... I went to Costa Rica for a few months. What is going on?
michael_scott No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate.
policeman_1 Officer 1 Really?
policeman_1 Officer 2 Check this out.
michael_scott Oh God!
toby_flenderson That is not mine. I have never seen that before.
michael_scott No, no no no no.
policeman_1 Officer 1 Turn around.
toby_flenderson What is going on here?
michael_scott God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is. And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
policeman_1 Officer 1 Do you have any weapons?
toby_flenderson Of course not!
michael_scott Ahh, that's mine.
dwight_schrute No! Michael, no!
michael_scott Yes, it's mine.
policeman_1 Officer 2 Some basil. Salad dressing, I think.
policeman_1 Officer 1 Salad dressing?
policeman_1 Officer 2 Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad. There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.
michael_scott Are you kidding me? That's my salad.
dwight_schrute So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
policeman_1 Officer 2 No.
dwight_schrute Gahh, dammit! Come on!
policeman_1 Officer 1 We got a fake tip.
dwight_schrute Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
policeman_1 Officer 1 No.
dwight_schrute You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?
michael_scott You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
toby_flenderson I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
michael_scott Hmm.
toby_flenderson Did you?
michael_scott Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
toby_flenderson You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
michael_scott Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
michael_scott You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So...
toby_flenderson I did leave.
michael_scott Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
toby_flenderson Well, I don't see it that way.
michael_scott Do you want to hear a lie?
toby_flenderson What?
michael_scott I think you're great. You're my best friend.
ryan_howard I can't do this.
kelly_kapoor Can't do what?
ryan_howard It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me.
kelly_kapoor Wait, what are you saying? I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
ryan_howard That was your choice; don't put that on me. I'm just going on a little trip.
kelly_kapoor Oh, can I come?
ryan_howard It's not that kind of trip. I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school. And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go. And I'll always resent you for it... you don't want me to resent you, do you?
kelly_kapoor So you're dumping me?
ryan_howard Let's be adults about this. Let's have s*x one more time. And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
kelly_kapoor Okay?
jim_halpert Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
pam_beesly Sure.
jim_halpert Cool.
pam_beesly What are we doing at your parent's house?
jim_halpert I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now open your eyes. Tadah!
pam_beesly I don't get it.
jim_halpert I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so...
jim_halpert So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect for an art studio. Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
pam_beesly I love it.
jim_halpert You do?
pam_beesly Yeah, I love it!
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly I mean, you bought me a house!
jim_halpert Oh my God...
pam_beesly You bought me a house!
jim_halpert Yeah, I did.
pam_beesly Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
jim_halpert No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
pam_beesly And the clown?
jim_halpert Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.
dwight_schrute What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.
