erin The tea in Nepal is very hot.
kevin But the coffee in Peru is much hotter.
dwight Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first
project increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they're protecting America's real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day's security codes. Something that's been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It's not the KGB, but it's a start.
erin The tea in Nepal is very hot.
dwight But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
erin Close.
dwight This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
erin Colder.
dwight The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
erin No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, "the coffee in Peru is much hotter. "
dwight Ah, much, ok.
erin But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. Unless you want me to break protocol?
dwight No, no. Give me the steam.
dwight It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
dwight Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
creed Oh, I'm saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
philip Mama!
oscar Angela, someone wants you.
angela Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
oscar Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it's angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o.
oscar Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
esther Go get ‘em, honey.
dwight Oh, don't worry. They'll get got.
dwight Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check. on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.
andy Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that's premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick. Check-in
guy Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.
andy Yes!
andy Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It's a really cool show, it's like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
jim Sales form for you to sign.
dwight You know what to do. Ok
dwight Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
jim Aw, thanks, man.
dwight Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War—
jim No.
dwight Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
jim Pre-conference room meeting with dwight went really well.
pam Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
jim All depends on the conference room meeting itself. Uh, okay.
pam Is that them again?
jim Yeah.
pam Maybe you should call back?
jim I will. I will.
jim The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that's final. I almost lost pam over this business. I'm not risking that again.
pam When jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
dwight Welcome.
jim He welcomes you.
dwight Please take an agenda item.
jim Your agenda-taking pleases him.
dwight Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. "Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try. " That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
jim Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, "Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future. " Ok? That's nonsense.
pam Question.
jim Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
pam We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, "Nice jugs"?
jim That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
everyone Zero. No nonsense. You can't have nonsense.
dwight What is going on?
angela Daycare won't take phillip anymore.
oscar Why?
angela Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi.
oscar Hi, buddy.
dwight Ok. Um, new agenda item. phillip will be joining us in the office today.
jim Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited?
meredith I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap.
stanley Over the course of this documentary I've had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some
trouble my wife did it.
dwight I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
kevin Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
oscar I can't believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having s*x with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
creed This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
andy This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang "I Dreamed a Dream" from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
casey Whoo-hoo! casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great casey Dean for you.
andy No!
casey America wants it!
andy No, this is my time! You don't belt on my time! I belt on my time.
casey casey Dean!
andy casey Dean!
casey Man, those are some nice pipes.
andy Yeah.
casey What's your name?
andy Andy. What's yours?
angela Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
oscar Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
kevin Guys.
angela Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
kevin Guys.
angela Why don't you pack it?
kevin Guys. angela &amp;
oscar Kevin, what?
kevin Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says "bold front" instead of "cold front"? It's insane.
angela Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? phillip needs his apple snacks.
oscar Seriously, Kevin. I'm just gonna have to go to the store.
angela Ok, you go to the store.
kevin Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
dwight Not now! Private time!
jim I love Star Wars as much as the next guy—
dwight Hey, hey! Seriously?
jim My god, I'm so sorry. Well this might make up for
it I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
dwight Which is, of course.
jim Potential future nonsense.
dwight Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
jim I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager.
dwight The power source.
jim Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
dwight A loyal, but bungling apostle.
jim But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
dwight Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
jim Exactly.
dwight I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
jim Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests.
dwight I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
jim Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
dwight That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard.
casey What're you listening to?
andy Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
casey Oh, sweet.
andy A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch. Mark
mcgrath What's up, everybody? And welcome to America's Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!
casey Ah! It's Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You're gorgeous! Mark
mcgrath Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!
andy There's a mole? Mark
mcgrath Oops. I'm not supposed to—I'm not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?
andy What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it. Mark
mcgrath Good man right there. I'll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?
andy Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
casey What? On a roll much?
andy I don't know where it came from.
casey That was amazing, man!
andy Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
casey Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.
andy I did, I felt it.
casey Big time.
pam What are you so excited about?
jim Nothing.
pam What are you up to?
jim Members of the office, hear ye.
dwight That means ye, Plop!
pete Plop? Still?
dwight We owe andy that much. Am I right people?
pete Fine.
jim Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
erin Aw, heck ya!
pam Nice.
dwight You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
jim This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring.
dwight Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
jim He envies you.
dwight You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it.
jim Alright.
jim By 2
 00, dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
darryl What up?
glenn What's going on? How was the delivery?
darryl Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I'm here.
darryl I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
jim A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
meredith Uh, two.
jim 985, 000, 000, 000, 017.
dwight Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
jim Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
pam Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
jim Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
dwight Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job.
jim That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
pete A horse.
jim Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
pete What's the opposite of a horse?
jim Come on. jim &amp;
dwight Sea horse.
jim Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna— jim &amp;
dwight Say that? Uncanny.
jim Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
clark Yeah.
jim Do you want a corn dog?
clark I would love a corn dog.
jim We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
clark Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went. "
dwight No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations.
jim Uncanny.
soldier I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they'll feel like anything is possible.
andy Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
casey Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.
andy What?
casey Yeah.
andy Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
casey I don't know. But I'm getting really worried here.
andy Me too. Hold my place in line.
casey Where are you going?
andy They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
darryl Thanks, man.
hank Thank you.
darryl Yep. Take care.
pam Darryl, hey.
darryl Hey.
pam Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
darryl No, no, I'm not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn't say goodbye to.
pam Aha. How's Athlead?
darryl We livin' like rock stars. I'm about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
pam Wow.
darryl jim really doesn't want to come?
pam He says he doesn't want to.
darryl Wow. Man. I hope he doesn't regret it.
pam Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
darryl jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
pam That's what he says.
darryl If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
jim An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
dwight A thousand times more.
phyllis I'll try this one.
jim Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
phyllis Hot!
jim Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
dwight No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
jim Look at that form.
dwight Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
jim Uncanny.
erin Darryl?! Darryl!
kevin Whoa.
darryl Oh, hey. Hey, what's up, y'all?
erin You left us without saying goodbye.
darryl Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
meredith Hey! No way!
kevin That's totally uncool.
erin Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
darryl I don't think I sh-
erin Get upstairs, mister!
meredith Yeah!
kevin Right. Now.
darryl Guess I'm going upstairs.
jim You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing—none of these people are good enough.
dwight I know.
jim What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said.
dwight Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
jim Is-
dwight Me.
jim The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is dwight K. Schrute.
dwight Yes! Thank you.
jim I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. That's it. You look really, really good.
dwight Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
jim Hey.
pam Hey.
jim You all right? What's going on?
pam Are you happy?
jim Yes, I'm happy.
pam No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
jim Yeah.
pam And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
jim What?
pam What about five years from now?
jim Pam.
pam Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just—I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much.
jim This was my decision, not yours.
pam Okay.
jim You didn't force me.
pam I kind of forced you to do it.
jim You did not force me to do this.
pam Yes, I did.
jim I don't know how else to tell you.
pam I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that—
jim Resent you?
pam This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you.
jim Is that really what you think? . push;
jim Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys. Camera
crew Okay. You got it, man.
darryl I didn't realize we were this close.
phyllis We're all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
meredith Are you gonna come to Poor Richard's and watch with us tonight?
darryl Uh. yeah. Depending on traffic.
stanley He ain't coming.
erin Oh, god!
darryl These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
darryl Well, it's been great.
phyllis Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he's gone for who knows how long.
darryl Maybe forever. Anyhow—
oscar Did we ever have lunch together, just—just the two of us? You know what, I'm gonna make reservations right now at Cugino's.
meredith Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
darryl Oh, oh, I'm sure we did.
meredith Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
clark Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
erin Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl's next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we'll get this started.
darryl Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you're feeling sentimental.
meredith You have to!
darryl Hey, hey, hey. I'll do one thing with y'all.
phyllis Which thing?
darryl I don't care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
angela Kevin, Kevin.
kevin Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking.
angela Kevin, could you not do that?
kevin What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
oscar Here, use my pen.
kevin Don't tell me what to do! angela &amp;
oscar Shhh!
kevin No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me.
angela Kevin, where are you going?
kevin Away. Tell phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
oscar He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper.
angela I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
dwight Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.
andy Hey, what's goin' on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young'uns?
casey You're back!
andy No, it's me, Andy!
casey No, I know.
andy No, no, no. I'm wearing makeup.
casey You did a really great job. You even look shorter.
andy Oh, I took out my lifts.
casey Oh.
andy Yeah, unlike andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
casey Oh.
esther All day long, it's moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
dwight Oink the pigs, that is very important.
esther Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
dwight The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
dwight Thank you, Esther.
esther Bye.
jim You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
dwight I need you to perform a test.
jim Perform a test.
dwight On an innocent baby.
jim Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz.
dwight Damn straight.
jim Unless you think he can't handle it.
dwight Hey, he can handle it.
jim All right.
oscar Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley's sleeping. You don't want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
stanley I heard that.
phillip Mama.
dwight Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
pam He does have a gift.
oscar Well, he's calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
phillip Mama.
dwight Okay. You ever been in a manager's office before?
dwight Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called "Schrute or Consequences. " You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
phillip Beet.
dwight Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes. Check-in
guy Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions. People in
line Oh come on! Hey!
andy Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what? Check-in
guy But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America's Next A Cappella Sensa—
andy Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't do that. You can't do that, we've all been waiting. Check-in
guy Okay.
andy I am going in there! Don't— Check-in
guy No, you're not, sir.
andy Don't—don't— Check-in
guy Please don't.
andy Don't touch me. Check-in
guy I'm not touching you. Okay?
casey Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don't you dare. Don't get—I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I'm casey Dean! You'll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won't be seeing the last of me!
oscar Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
dwight That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
kevin He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.
andy Hi. You're still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You're like, my three favorite people ever.
santigold What is this?
andy Sweetheart, you're amazing, okay? You're obviously gonna be on the show, so it's someone else's turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, my name is Ezra Cornell and I'm just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart. Aaron
rodgers No, you're a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.
andy Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that. Clay
aiken No, we do not want to hear you sing.
santigold Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.
andy Nope! Can't end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss's car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern. Aaron
rodgers Flag on the play.
andy That's—that's what—yeah. Okay, all right, well, here's the song. Far above Cayuga's waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater—
santigold What is this song?
andy Are you insane? It's the Cornell fight song. Clay
aiken Listen, all right, thank you very much, we're not interested.
andy You didn't let me finish. That's not fair. Aaron
rodgers Look, man, you're not terrible. We've heard a lot of really good singers today and you're just not good enough.
andy Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that's the show. Let me try a different song, okay? Aaron
rodgers Can he do this?
andy Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you're never fully dressed without a smile. Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly—
santigold Look, you gotta go. You can't just sit here and cry.
andy Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
jim Thank you.
oscar Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
kevin Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
oscar Okay, I guess, it's just that phillip got you something.
angela Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
oscar I think there's, like, $7 left.
angela It's just his way of saying, "Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting. "
kevin phillip got this for me?
oscar Sure.
kevin That was a really cool move.
angela Would you like to hold Phillip? Yeah. That's Kevin.
kevin Whoa.
oscar Easy.
kevin What a chubbers. Whoa.
angela Okay, watch it.
kevin I'm losing my balance.
angela No, Kevin, no.
oscar Hey, no.
kevin Whoa!
oscar No horseplay.
angela Stop it.
kevin You wanna play with the cactus?
angela No, no!
kevin So, me and phillip were just talking and we decided we're gonna be best friends. He's a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
erin We have our decision.
darryl You chose one thing?
erin We want to dance with you.
darryl You want to dance?
erin One dance, all of us together.
darryl This is what you want?
erin Absolutely.
darryl Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we're gonna do this right.
erin Yes!
angela Hey. You wanted to see me?
dwight Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.
angela I am sorry he's here today but I had—
dwight I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
angela How thoughtful.
dwight Then the two of you would move to my 1, 600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.
angela If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son.
dwight Very well.
angela Can I go back to my desk now?
dwight Yes.
pam What is this?
jim Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so I needed a little help.
dwight Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
jim OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
dwight Now.
jim I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
dwight Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.
pam Go ahead.
jim Ok, um, this is. —I'll be right back.
jim What do we got?
dwight I was thinking of proposing to esther today.
jim Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step.
dwight She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest.
jim Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.
dwight Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
jim That's a lot of pros.
dwight And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
jim So what is the problem?
dwight Angela.
jim I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
dwight Some sort of virus?
jim Love.
dwight Oh.
jim Dwight,
listen no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
dwight You're a good assistant, Jim.
jim Not as good as you.
dwight That's very true. Get the hell outta here.
jim You got it.
jim You watched it.
pam Yeah.
