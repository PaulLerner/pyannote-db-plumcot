dwight_schrute Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! Que? QUE?
hispanic_boy We don't go with that man. I've seen several men go with that man and not come back.
hispanic_boy We've lost friends.
hispanic_boy We don't know what he does with them.
hispanic_boy I don't want to talk about it anymore.
dwight_schrute I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
nate Hola amigo.
dwight_schrute Hola, tu es une buena worker?
nate Si, yo muy bueno worker.
dwight_schrute Y el accento, donde are you from?
nate Scranton, y before that La Philadelphia.
dwight_schrute You speak English?
nate Yes, I'm really good at English.
dwight_schrute Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
nate Okay.
dwight_schrute
angela_martin Who's this guy by our cars?
dwight_schrute That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
phyllis_vance Yeah, I got stung up my dress.
dwight_schrute Poor hornet.
dwight_schrute I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
ryan_howard But if he doesn't?
dwight_schrute He'll die.
kelly_kapoor What?
andy_bernard Uhh, beg your pardon?
dwight_schrute When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
nate
kelly_kapoor Is that a blow torch?!
pam_beesly No. No no no!
dwight_schrute Interesting choice...
pam_beesly Yes!
andy_bernard Very very smart.
pam_beesly Yeah, go away.
nate
all@ except Dwight No! No no!
dwight_schrute A bat! Impressive...
andy_bernard Oh it's stinging him! Ow! Ow!
helene_beesly Good morning Erin, any mustaches? I mean messages?
erin_hannon Terrific!
michael_scott There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves... other things as well.
phyllis_vance God! Wow!
michael_scott Look, It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
phyllis_vance That's no pimple Michael.
michael_scott You mean cancer?
pam_beesly What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
pam_beesly It's just good to stop a Michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
meredith_palmer Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
michael_scott It is?
meredith_palmer Yup, just a cold sore.
michael_scott Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
kevin_malone I know how you got it.
michael_scott How?
kevin_malone Michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
michael_scott What?
pam_beesly Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
meredith_palmer I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
kevin_malone I never seen herpes on you.
meredith_palmer Because it's on my genitals, genius.
kevin_malone You have a pen1s?
andy_bernard Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
michael_scott Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
jim_halpert That was like, ten years ago.
michael_scott No! It was like four years ago!
kevin_malone Michael, you're at least forty six!
michael_scott Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six.
kelly_kapoor Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
angela_martin This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
andy_bernard You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
kelly_kapoor I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
oscar_martinez I don't even wanna know these things!
meredith_palmer Hey guys!
michael_scott How did this happen, how did I get this?
dwight_schrute Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
michael_scott You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
dwight_schrute What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
michael_scott Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
dwight_schrute You may have...
michael_scott Oh my God! What if I did?
dwight_schrute You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
michael_scott Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
dwight_schrute You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
michael_scott There's no way I'm gonna do that.
dwight_schrute Then I will.
michael_scott
dwight_schrute No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
donna Hello?
michael_scott Hi Donna. It's Michael.
donna Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?
michael_scott I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
donna Oh no.
michael_scott I can't even say it. H-I...
donna Oh my God.
michael_scott ...R-P-E-E-S
donna Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
michael_scott No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
donna Ummm, no.
michael_scott Does your stupid husband have it?
donna No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
michael_scott Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
dwight_schrute So long Donna!
andy_bernard Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
stanley_hudson Not again...
andy_bernard What do you mean again?
stanley_hudson You're always asking for our attention.
andy_bernard Maybe like a year ago...
stanley_hudson Seems recent.
andy_bernard No, that's...
oscar_martinez Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
andy_bernard Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
phyllis_vance Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
stanley_hudson That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
andy_bernard It's the world's only international sport!
holly_flax This is Holly.
michael_scott No this is Holly.
holly_flax No this is Holly.
michael_scott No this is Holly.
holly_flax No, this is Michael Scott.
michael_scott Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
holly_flax I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
michael_scott Oh really? Was anyone killed?
holly_flax A lot of people.
michael_scott Any nuns?
holly_flax Three nuns, from a Missionary in South Africa.
michael_scott Were they in the missionary position?
andy_bernard Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
michael_scott Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott We would have twins.
holly_flax I don't think we'd have kids.
michael_scott Mmhmm!
holly_flax It was just for a few weeks!
michael_scott Mhhmm! We would be married.
holly_flax Michael, I have been dating A.J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
michael_scott Do what?
holly_flax You romanticize things.
michael_scott I don't romanticize th- No...
holly_flax Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
michael_scott He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
holly_flax You made ourselves to be more than we were.
michael_scott We were more than we were.
holly_flax I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
michael_scott Ok, alright I gotta go.
holly_flax Michael...
dwight_schrute He forgot to mention the herpes.
michael_scott It didn't come up organically.
jan_levinson ...to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to...
jan_levinson How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you.
michael_scott It's nice to see you doing so well.
jan_levinson Yeah I'm really happy. Me and Astrid against the world. We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
michael_scott Bringing home the bacon.
jan_levinson Yeah. Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... I love that commercial.
dwight_schrute I don't understand the reference.
jan_levinson Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
dwight_schrute We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you.
jan_levinson Are you gonna keep me in suspense?
michael_scott Would you excuse us...
dwight_schrute Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
michael_scott He hasn't changed.
jan_levinson No, so what couldn't wait?
michael_scott Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
jan_levinson Michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
michael_scott What?
jan_levinson You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
andy_bernard So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia.
erin_hannon Andy...
andy_bernard What, is it because he's black?
jim_halpert Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
andy_bernard Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia.
jim_halpert Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
andy_bernard It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
jan_levinson No! In the beginning we were not good.
michael_scott Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
jan_levinson Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
michael_scott Because we work together.
jan_levinson No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
michael_scott Am I the princess?
jan_levinson No I'm the princess, and the queen.
michael_scott Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
jans_daughter Mommy!
jan_levinson Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
jans_daughter It was cool.
jan_levinson What did you learn?
jans_daughter What did I learn?
jan_levinson You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
michael_scott I have herpes.
michael_scott I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong...
andy_bernard Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of s*x. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
kevin_malone It feels unbelievable!
andy_bernard Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels...
kevin_malone ...unbelievable.
phyllis_vance The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
andy_bernard Express love, magical.
kevin_malone It feels amazing!
andy_bernard Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
kevin_malone Yes.
andy_bernard Then I will write it down.
creed_bratton The feeling of pure risk.
andy_bernard I actually had that down in the cons column, but...
creed_bratton It's thrilling.
andy_bernard Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
erin_hannon Andy, aren't there also negatives to s*x?
andy_bernard Yes! Thank you! Such as?
erin_hannon Unplanned pregnancy.
andy_bernard Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
kelly_kapoor Like Jim and Pam, say whaaat?
kevin_malone Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
pam_beesly Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
jim_halpert Good!
darryl_philbin I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros.
jim_halpert and Pam Thank you!
andy_bernard Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
dwight_schrute Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
michael_scott You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
dwight_schrute Jan knows paper.
michael_scott No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
dwight_schrute Wait, what Holly said?
michael_scott Yes, I don't...
dwight_schrute Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
michael_scott I know, I know.
dwight_schrute Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
michael_scott Got it.
dwight_schrute TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
michael_scott I'M TRYING! GOD!
michael_scott Hi stranger! Long time!
woman_on_park_bench Woman Who are you?
michael_scott I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
woman_on_park_bench Woman I don't think so...
woman_on_park_bench Michael?
michael_scott Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
dwight_schrute Come on old lady. Let's go.
woman_on_park_bench Woman What is happening?
dwight_schrute Come on.
andy_bernard Who can tell me what the safest form of s*x is?
darryl_philbin Condoms.
andy_bernard Incorrect, the only true form of safe s*x, ok? Abstinence.
darryl_philbin Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski!
andy_bernard I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody?
pam_beesly Andy that's way too personal of a question.
andy_bernard Well someone could answer if they want to. Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on... using this pencil.
andy_bernard What?
oscar_martinez Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
andy_bernard Well I'm not gonna use my pen1s, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
meredith_palmer Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
andy_bernard I'm doing this for you Meredith!
meredith_palmer I didn't want you it!
andy_bernard Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?!
woman_on_park_bench It'll go away in time just don't touch it.
michael_scott Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
woman_on_park_bench What did you think we were?
michael_scott Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
woman_on_park_bench I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
michael_scott Jerk.
dwight_schrute Michael!
carol_stills So this is the chef's kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers.
michael_scott Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
carol_stills Michael.
michael_scott Carroll, how are you?
carol_stills I'm great! How are you?
michael_scott I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
carol_stills You didn't call my office and ask where I was?
michael_scott No.
carol_stills Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.
michael_scott Weird...
carol_stills Yeah.
michael_scott He sounds like a nice guy.
andy_bernard I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
gabe_lewis This wasn't really about Meredith was it. You and Erin are broken up.
andy_bernard How is that relevant to anything?
gabe_lewis I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
andy_bernard The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
gabe_lewis I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole Erin thing behind you.
michael_scott Oh wow another living room!
carol_stills It's a family room.
michael_scott You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
carol_stills Michael why are you here?
michael_scott Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
carol_stills You know, we all do that.
michael_scott I have herpes.
carol_stills What? Did you have that while we were together?
michael_scott I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
carol_stills Oh! Oh, that's what you're talking about?
michael_scott Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
carol_stills Did the doctor check it out?
michael_scott I'm between specialists right now.
carol_stills Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date.
michael_scott Well I believe in love at first sight.
carol_stills Well so do I, but we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking!
michael_scott I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
dwight_schrute Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
carol_stills No.
darryl_philbin We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
andy_bernard No I'm just sweating.
darryl_philbin I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
andy_bernard I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
darryl_philbin Look you need to pick yourself up. Man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
andy_bernard Ok.
darryl_philbin Yeah.
darryl_philbin I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
holly_flax This is Holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up.
michael_scott Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
oscar_martinez What is this about?
michael_scott Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
oscar_martinez Yes!
michael_scott You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
oscar_martinez What?
michael_scott Herpes duplex.
dwight_schrute It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
michael_scott I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
oscar_martinez We were never lovers!
dwight_schrute I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had s*x with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
michael_scott Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
dwight_schrute Fence with a hole in it..
michael_scott Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
dwight_schrute The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
michael_scott An electric car dealership.
dwight_schrute The democratic primaries,
michael_scott Oscar! Think abou- Think!
