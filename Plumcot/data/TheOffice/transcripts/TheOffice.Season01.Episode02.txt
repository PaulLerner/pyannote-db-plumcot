michael_scott Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
mr_brown Brown Oh, I'm all set, thanks.
michael_scott Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
michael_scott Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.
jim_halpert That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content." What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
jim_halpert Do you really have to do that right now?
dwight_schrute Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
jim_halpert Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Retaliation. Tit for tit.
jim_halpert That is not the expression.
dwight_schrute Well, it should be.
jim_halpert This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
jim_halpert Solitaire?
pam_beesly Yeah, Freecell.
jim_halpert Six on seven.
pam_beesly I know. I saw that.
jim_halpert So then, why didn't you do it?
pam_beesly I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
jim_halpert Who doesn't love that?
michael_scott Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
oscar_martinez All right.
michael_scott Did you have a good weekend going there?
oscar_martinez It was fine.
michael_scott Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
oscar_martinez Martinez.
michael_scott Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
mr_brown Brown Great. We're all set.
michael_scott Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
jim_halpert Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
michael_scott It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
jim_halpert You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
mr_brown Brown Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
michael_scott Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
mr_brown Brown Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
michael_scott You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.
mr_brown Brown Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
michael_scott Exactly, were not...
mr_brown Brown That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
michael_scott With tolerance.
mr_brown Brown No. With more ignorance.
michael_scott Ignorance.
mr_brown Brown Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
michael_scott Let's celebrate.
mr_brown Brown Right. OK.
michael_scott Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
mr_brown Brown Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...
michael_scott You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
dwight_schrute I have two. White and Indian.
mr_brown Brown Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
michael_scott Yes.
mr_brown Brown Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
michael_scott OK.
mr_brown Brown Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
dwight_schrute A few of the ground rules?
michael_scott Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
dwight_schrute OK, can we steer away from gay people?
mr_brown Brown Um...
dwight_schrute I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
mr_brown Brown Well, we only have an hour.
dwight_schrute I figured it would save time.
michael_scott OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
mr_brown Brown Mr. Brown.
michael_scott Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
mr_brown Brown Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.
michael_scott How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?
mr_brown Brown So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
michael_scott I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
mr_brown Brown Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.
michael_scott OK, I will play guy listening.
mr_brown Brown Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
kevin_malone I remember.
mr_brown Brown Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
michael_scott OK.
michael_scott Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
kevin_malone Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
michael_scott OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... I take care of my kid!
mr_brown Brown Wait a second.
michael_scott They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
mr_brown Brown Stop it!
michael_scott What you want a cookie?
mr_brown Brown Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
dwight_schrute Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
mr_brown Brown Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
dwight_schrute A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
mr_brown Brown OK.
dwight_schrute A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
mr_brown Brown Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
dwight_schrute We all have a hero in our heart.
mr_brown Brown Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
michael_scott I don't think I can sign this.
mr_brown Brown I can't leave until you do.
michael_scott Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
mr_brown Brown Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
michael_scott Sure.
mr_brown Brown We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.
michael_scott Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.
mr_brown Brown Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.
michael_scott OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
mr_brown Brown Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
michael_scott OK.
mr_brown Brown Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
michael_scott Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
mr_brown Brown Don't worry about dating.
michael_scott I won't.
mr_brown Brown OK. Thank you.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah.
michael_scott "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..." Open-mindedness, is that even a word? "...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck." He's going to lose it when he reads that.
jim_halpert Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
michael_scott "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
michael_scott All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
toby_flenderson Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we?
michael_scott Get out.
toby_flenderson I'm sorry.
michael_scott No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
michael_scott Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North." And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
michael_scott OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
jim_halpert Uh, is that it?
michael_scott Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
kevin_malone It was kind of hard to hear.
michael_scott Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
kelly_kapoor I have a customer meeting.
michael_scott Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
oscar_martinez What part Native American?
michael_scott Two fifteenths.
oscar_martinez Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
michael_scott Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
oscar_martinez OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.
michael_scott Oh, yeah...
oscar_martinez And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
michael_scott Wow.
oscar_martinez My parents were Mexican.
michael_scott Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
oscar_martinez Thank... Yeah...
michael_scott Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
oscar_martinez Mexican isn't offensive.
michael_scott Well, it has certain connotations.
oscar_martinez Like what?
michael_scott Like... I don't... I don't know.
oscar_martinez What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
michael_scott No. Now, remember that honesty...
oscar_martinez I'm just curious.
michael_scott ...empathy, respect... Jim! Jim!
jim_halpert Hello? Hello?
michael_scott I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.
michael_scott Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...
michael_scott Oh this is a good one.
pam_beesly Um, hi. How are you?
stanley_hudson Fine. How are you?
pam_beesly Great.
michael_scott Push it.
stanley_hudson I admire your culture's success in America.
pam_beesly Thank you.
michael_scott Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
stanley_hudson Who am I supposed to be?
michael_scott No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
dwight_schrute Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
dwight_schrute Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
pam_beesly That's nice, Dwight.
dwight_schrute OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
pam_beesly OK, I like your food.
dwight_schrute Outback steakhouse. I'm Australian, mate!
michael_scott Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
pam_beesly OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.
dwight_schrute Oh, man, am I a woman?
michael_scott You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs." Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.
jim_halpert What are you watching?
ryan_howard Chappelle's Show.
jim_halpert Really?
ryan_howard I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
jim_halpert No way. I think she likes this stuff.
ryan_howard Great. She's cute, huh?
jim_halpert Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
ryan_howard Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah. She's hot.
kevin_malone Hey.
angela_martin Hey.
kevin_malone You wanna go to the beach?
angela_martin Sure.
kevin_malone You wanna get high?
angela_martin No.
kevin_malone I think you do, mon.
angela_martin Stop...
michael_scott OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
michael_scott Kelly, how are you?
kelly_kapoor I just had the longest meeting.
michael_scott Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my...
michael_scott All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
jim_halpert Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
michael_scott I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
kevin_malone Maybe some spagh-etti.
michael_scott Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
stanley_hudson It's collard greens.
michael_scott What?
stanley_hudson It's collard greens.
michael_scott That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
jim_halpert Um... Hey.
pam_beesly Mmmm.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert We can go.
pam_beesly Sorry.
jim_halpert That's fine.
jim_halpert Uh... Not a bad day.
