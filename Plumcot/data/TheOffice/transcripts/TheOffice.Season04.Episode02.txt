pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly I gotcha one.
jim_halpert Oh wow, thank you.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
pam_beesly No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?
jim_halpert I guess. How dare you.
michael_scott Hey Toby. What's this?
toby_flenderson Ohh.
michael_scott I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
toby_flenderson Yes, uh some people in the office have complained...
michael_scott Oh really.
toby_flenderson ...about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
michael_scott Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
toby_flenderson Ok, look the memo is not about you...
angela_martin For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
toby_flenderson Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about Jim and Pam. So...
michael_scott No way.
dwight_schrute What?
phyllis_vance You guys are together?
jim_halpert Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
michael_scott Woooah! Wow!
andy_bernard Tuna!
michael_scott Awesome!
kevin_malone I knew it!
michael_scott You guys! Yes! Yes!
pam_beesly Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
toby_flenderson Yes.
michael_scott Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, stand up. OK, here we go. Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
jim_halpert Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
michael_scott I love you guys, so much.
jim_halpert Ohh..
pam_beesly Phone's ringing.
michael_scott No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
dwight_schrute I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
angela_martin It's not a surprise to me. Pam is the office mattress.
andy_bernard Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
michael_scott Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
phyllis_vance Did you plan it?
michael_scott No.
pam_beesly Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
michael_scott Blowing up balloons I thought.
pam_beesly You might want to trim it a little.
phyllis_vance Michael...
kelly_kapoor Oh, is... Ryan coming back today?
pam_beesly Yeah, he is.
kelly_kapoor Oh.
michael_scott Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
angela_martin What do you want?
dwight_schrute To give you this .
angela_martin Oh, what is that?
dwight_schrute It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
angela_martin Her name was Sprinkles.
dwight_schrute And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. Don't you Garbage?
angela_martin I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
dwight_schrute You haven't buried her yet?
angela_martin Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
dwight_schrute Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. Look at him.
angela_martin I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!
pam_beesly Hey Toby.
toby_flenderson Hey... you two.
jim_halpert Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
toby_flenderson Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know relationships, so... if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
jim_halpert Oh.
pam_beesly Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official.
toby_flenderson Uh huh.
jim_halpert Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
toby_flenderson Let's just wait and see what happens. You know?
jim_halpert What?
toby_flenderson Let's just wait.
jim_halpert Oh, OK.
pam_beesly OK.
jim_halpert Great.
pam_beesly Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
ryan_howard Hold on one second. Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is Michael in?
michael_scott Hey!
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
ryan_howard OK. Should we get started?
michael_scott Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
ryan_howard Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
michael_scott ...business meeting --
kevin_malone Fire!
ryan_howard Stop that! Stop that!
michael_scott That's right! That's right!
ryan_howard You scared me.
michael_scott Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
andy_bernard Fire guy
kevin_malone You weren't here for that.
andy_bernard Here for what?
kevin_malone When he started the fire.
michael_scott Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
kevin_malone Little old man boy.
ryan_howard Michael and everybody, umm...
michael_scott Beard.
kevin_malone Bearded man boy.
ryan_howard ...let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
michael_scott Oh, wow!
ryan_howard So...
michael_scott That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
ryan_howard OK...
michael_scott Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
ryan_howard Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?
michael_scott Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in 10 minutes?
ryan_howard Perfect.
michael_scott Sounds good. OK, alright.
michael_scott Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you." His words.
ryan_howard Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
jim_halpert Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it.
ryan_howard This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
michael_scott OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
ryan_howard I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
dwight_schrute What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
ryan_howard This is company-wide, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Got it.
ryan_howard Andy.
andy_bernard We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
ryan_howard Any other questions? Kelly Kapoor.
kelly_kapoor Can we speak privately about our relationship?
ryan_howard Thank you everybody.
michael_scott Ryan Howard everybody. Good job.
creed_bratton That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
ryan_howard As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A.S.A.P., so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
creed_bratton Cool beans.
creed_bratton We're screwed.
michael_scott Who is?
creed_bratton Us? You and me. The old timers.
michael_scott I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
creed_bratton You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
jim_halpert Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.
pam_beesly No..
jim_halpert Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
pam_beesly No, they have been dating for like two years. Since before your barbeque.
jim_halpert Wait. What? You knew? And you didn't say anything?
pam_beesly You didn't say anything to me?
jim_halpert Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
pam_beesly Can you believe that...
phyllis_vance Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
jim_halpert Oh no, we're just sitting here.
phyllis_vance I couldn't see your hands. Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
pam_beesly OK.
phyllis_vance OK.
jim_halpert OK.
jim_halpert And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.
ryan_howard OK, what's up?
michael_scott Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
ryan_howard Well it is business, but not as usual.
michael_scott Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
ryan_howard No. We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
michael_scott Good, so, we're on the same page?
ryan_howard No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
michael_scott We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
ryan_howard So, how are you?
kelly_kapoor Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
ryan_howard Good.
kelly_kapoor A lot. Black guys mostly.
ryan_howard Kelly...
kelly_kapoor What?!
phyllis_vance Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
stanley_hudson I don't know.
phyllis_vance Did you even try?
stanley_hudson If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
phyllis_vance I can't see half of the things.
stanley_hudson It's too little. Use the phone.
kelly_kapoor I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
ryan_howard Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
kelly_kapoor Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
ryan_howard I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
kelly_kapoor Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
kelly_kapoor
kelly_kapoor And guess what buddy, I am keeping it.
ryan_howard OK. OK.
kelly_kapoor Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
ryan_howard I can... I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
kelly_kapoor We have a date!
dwight_schrute Hello.
angela_martin Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
dwight_schrute Really?
angela_martin Yes.
dwight_schrute I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
angela_martin I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
jan_levinson Hi, Pam.
pam_beesly Hi.
jan_levinson Is Michael in?
pam_beesly In his office. You can go right in.
jan_levinson Hey.
ryan_howard Jan.
jan_levinson Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
ryan_howard So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
jan_levinson Well, not exactly my job... I had a different title.
ryan_howard Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
jan_levinson Different salary. You'll get there, don't worry.
ryan_howard Well... you look great.
jan_levinson Thank you, thank you.
ryan_howard Scranton suits you.
jan_levinson Best decision I ever made.
ryan_howard You were let go.
jan_levinson You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.
michael_scott Hey.
jan_levinson Hey.
michael_scott Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
jan_levinson What?
michael_scott I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
jan_levinson So, what's Ryan doing here?
michael_scott Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
jan_levinson He's such a snake.
michael_scott Well...
jan_levinson I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
michael_scott What is that... word?
jan_levinson Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
michael_scott So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
jan_levinson Yes, Michael, they do.
oscar_martinez Creed?
creed_bratton Yes, sir.
oscar_martinez Everything OK?
creed_bratton Everything's cool, dude.
creed_bratton I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
ryan_howard Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
pam_beesly Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
ryan_howard Ohh... man.
michael_scott Good, we're all here, we can get started.
ryan_howard Michael.
michael_scott Have a seat.
ryan_howard We're not doing this today.
michael_scott Have a seat. Like everybody else.
ryan_howard OK. This is...
michael_scott Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
toby_flenderson Technically, he's right.
michael_scott Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
creed_bratton Because they're lame.
michael_scott No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" Yeah.
jim_halpert Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
pam_beesly Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
michael_scott I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
pam_beesly Oh.
robert_dunder Dunder Michael Scott?
michael_scott That is me. Come on in. Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?
dwight_schrute Oh, yeah. Yes!
robert_dunder Dunder Thank you everyone.
ryan_howard Michael, can I talk to you a second?
michael_scott Sure thing. 'Scuse me.
ryan_howard We have actual work to do.
michael_scott Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
michael_scott Bob, how old are you?
robert_dunder Dunder I'm 87.
michael_scott Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
robert_dunder Dunder Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.
michael_scott Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
robert_dunder Dunder I started this company in 1949.
michael_scott Wow.
robert_dunder Dunder Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.
michael_scott Oh, boy.
robert_dunder Dunder And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later... Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.
michael_scott Great.
robert_dunder Dunder And he was, he was at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm... uhh... Jerry.. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.
michael_scott Great.
robert_dunder Dunder And...
michael_scott That's great. Thank you for coming in. Robert Dunder everybody. Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
robert_dunder Dunder Well I, I, I came here in a cab.
michael_scott Perfect.
robert_dunder Dunder Well, cou, could you get me another...
michael_scott Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail.
pam_beesly I think that I should help him get home.
michael_scott No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. What a nice guy.
michael_scott Good night guys.
ryan_howard Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
michael_scott I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
ryan_howard Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
michael_scott I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
ryan_howard Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. Where do you wanna go?
kelly_kapoor You know, some place romantic and expensive.
ryan_howard Kelly, come on.
kelly_kapoor You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it.
dwight_schrute Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
angela_martin Very much. How's your meat?
dwight_schrute Dry. Delicious.
angela_martin I heard a joke today.
dwight_schrute Oh, that's funny.
angela_martin Yes, it was.
dwight_schrute Are you enjoying your mineral water?
angela_martin I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
dwight_schrute Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here , it's an old sales trick.
angela_martin I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
dwight_schrute No, please don't do this, monkey.
angela_martin I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.
toby_flenderson Hey guys. This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
pam_beesly Hi.
jim_halpert Hey, Amy. How ya doing?
pam_beesly Nice to meet you.
jim_halpert Nice to meet you.
toby_flenderson This is everybody else... okay... This is the place... so thanks for the lift.
amy Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right?
toby_flenderson Absolutely.
amy Whoa. Easy tiger.
toby_flenderson I just really like you.
amy Okay. Bye guys. Nice to meet you.
toby_flenderson Have a great day!
pam_beesly Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
toby_flenderson I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
michael_scott Smell that. Do you smell that?
dwight_schrute Dry rot?
michael_scott No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
andy_bernard Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
michael_scott Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
michael_scott Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
dwight_schrute Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
angela_martin Thank you.
dwight_schrute You're welcome.
angela_martin Is that all?
dwight_schrute Yes... I miss you.
angela_martin Elevators.
angela_martin Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
dwight_schrute Fine. Then I just want to be friends.
angela_martin Good.
dwight_schrute Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
angela_martin
kelly_kapoor I don't understand what the big deal is.
ryan_howard You don't?
kelly_kapoor No!
ryan_howard You lied about being pregnant.
kelly_kapoor Right, so?
ryan_howard You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
kelly_kapoor No!
ryan_howard We're never getting back together.
kelly_kapoor Why not?
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
pam_beesly It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
jim_halpert I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
pam_beesly I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...
jim_halpert Be honest.
pam_beesly I now find you repulsive.
jim_halpert That's honest. Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
pam_beesly Eh...
jim_halpert For me, it was.
pam_beesly OK.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
ryan_howard What's, uh, going on here?
michael_scott I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
ryan_howard With gift baskets.
michael_scott With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.
michael_scott Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. "You can't be on the team", "You can't move on to second grade". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
michael_scott OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
stanley_hudson I'm not driving with him.
andy_bernard I'll go with you Stanley.
stanley_hudson Or him.
jim_halpert Why don't we just go by ourselves?
michael_scott Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
phyllis_vance Michael.
michael_scott Yes?
phyllis_vance This is stupid.
michael_scott OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
phyllis_vance How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
michael_scott Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
andy_bernard What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.
jim_halpert What about a gift basket full of cash?
andy_bernard Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
michael_scott Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
dwight_schrute Michael, wait. Let me go.
michael_scott No, this is my quest.
dwight_schrute Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. Please.
michael_scott Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
ryan_howard Good luck Michael.
michael_scott We don't need luck.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
michael_scott Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
ryan_howard Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize Kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies... Yeah, no, yes Kelly is Indian... I understand that's confusing.
creed_bratton Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
dwight_schrute Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
michael_scott It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
dwight_schrute Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
michael_scott I know. So who's next?
dwight_schrute Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
gps Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.
dwight_schrute Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
michael_scott Who?
dwight_schrute The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.
ryan_howard Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. I run into Vince Vaughn.
kevin_malone No way!
ryan_howard Literally.
andy_bernard Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
ryan_howard ... Later guys.
kevin_malone Yeah, later dude.
andy_bernard Later man.
kevin_malone Oh, Jim! How awesome is Ryan now?
jim_halpert Yeah, he's definitely something.
kevin_malone What does that mean?
jim_halpert That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
andy_bernard Ha! Tuna... Tuna Tuna Tuna.
kevin_malone Tuna Tuna Tuna.
andy_bernard He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
kevin_malone And he can get any girl that he wants.
andy_bernard So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.
kevin_malone Tuna. Check you later.
michael_scott Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?
larry_meyers Myers You know we closed our account with you right?
michael_scott Yes we do.
larry_meyers Myers We're with Office Depot now.
dwight_schrute Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
michael_scott Well...
dwight_schrute And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
michael_scott Mmhmm.
larry_meyers Myers OK. I don't think we're coming back.
dwight_schrute Please, come back.
michael_scott OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
dwight_schrute Remember what we had Larry?
larry_meyers Myers I mean, really it's about money.
michael_scott Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
larry_meyers Myers OK thanks.
michael_scott Alright.
larry_meyers Myers I mean their website is really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us.
michael_scott That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?
dwight_schrute I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
michael_scott That is true.
dwight_schrute Like Angela in accounting.
michael_scott Yes, she is nuts.
dwight_schrute Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
gps Make the next right turn.
michael_scott How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
ryan_howard Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
pam_beesly Uh totally.
ryan_howard Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
pam_beesly Yeah.
ryan_howard Thank you very much.
pam_beesly Thank you.
ryan_howard Cool.
pam_beesly OK.
pam_beesly Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
michael_scott And the last guy says "No, hairy body".
aaron_grandy You know I have heard it before.
michael_scott Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?
aaron_grandy She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory.
michael_scott She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
aaron_grandy Oh, OK.
michael_scott OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?
aaron_grandy OK thanks for the goodies.
michael_scott Ah... .is that all you have to say?
aaron_grandy It looks delicious? I don't know.
dwight_schrute You don't know?
michael_scott Look, we want you back.
aaron_grandy Can you offer lower prices?
michael_scott Well, no.
aaron_grandy Then we're not coming back.
dwight_schrute He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
michael_scott No it's not.
aaron_grandy No he's right.
dwight_schrute Accept it, why would he come back?
michael_scott Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
dwight_schrute That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
michael_scott Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
aaron_grandy Oh, OK. Well when it's up, I'll check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe we'll come back.
michael_scott Great, the magic of the gift basket.
aaron_grandy That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up.
michael_scott OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
gps Proceed straight.
dwight_schrute Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
michael_scott I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
dwight_schrute That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
michael_scott That is a very good point, Dwight.
gps Make a right turn.
dwight_schrute Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
michael_scott No, it said right, it said take a right.
dwight_schrute No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
michael_scott Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
dwight_schrute It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
michael_scott The machine knows where it is going!
dwight_schrute This is the lake!
michael_scott The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
dwight_schrute No, it's--- there's no road here!
dwight_schrute Remain calm! I have trained for this! Okay, exit the window! Here we go! Look out for leeches! Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! Michael! Michael!
michael_scott Let go, let go of me!
dwight_schrute I got you, I got you!
michael_scott You sure you're OK?
dwight_schrute Fine.
michael_scott Good, that is what's most important.
dwight_schrute Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
michael_scott What a disaster, this whole thing.
dwight_schrute I'll call a cab.
michael_scott These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
dwight_schrute Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
michael_scott What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
dwight_schrute Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
michael_scott Hang up. You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
dwight_schrute Take a stand!
pam_beesly So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
ryan_howard I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.
pam_beesly Thanks.
ryan_howard I'd love to talk to you about it more.
pam_beesly That'd be great.
ryan_howard Do you want to go out to dinner tonight?
pam_beesly Oh... is it...
ryan_howard Wear something nice.
pam_beesly No...
ryan_howard What?
pam_beesly Um...
ryan_howard I just... I just wanted to have dinner.
pam_beesly I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.
ryan_howard You're kidding?
pam_beesly We're together.
ryan_howard That's... great, I... that's awesome.
pam_beesly Yeah, great.
ryan_howard So let me um, let me look at these.
pam_beesly OK great!
ryan_howard Cool.
pam_beesly Great.
jim_halpert I guess he can't get any girl he wants.
aaron_grandy Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?
michael_scott Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
aaron_grandy Oh what is this?
dwight_schrute It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
aaron_grandy Maybe you should leave.
michael_scott Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!
dwight_schrute Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna Oops, sorry!
michael_scott Look, my clothes are so wet!
dwight_schrute Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy!
aaron_grandy Alright here you go, take it back!
michael_scott It's been opened.
aaron_grandy Yeah it was mine!
michael_scott What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
aaron_grandy Come on guys, get out of here!
michael_scott WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
dwight_schrute Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
aaron_grandy I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!
dwight_schrute We'll bill you.
michael_scott May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
ryan_howard That is not correct.
michael_scott Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
oscar_martinez You did what?
michael_scott I drove my car into a lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
jim_halpert Into a lake.
michael_scott Exactly!
phyllis_vance Did you get any clients back?
michael_scott Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
michael_scott Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
ryan_howard I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise... but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. ... It was two hundred dollars.
ryan_howard You should come visit. The city is... amazing.
jim_halpert I know. I love it there.
ryan_howard No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
jim_halpert Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
ryan_howard No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are... . it just... everything feels so limitless.
jim_halpert Sounds great.
ryan_howard No. It... eh... you can't... it's not about how it sounds.
jim_halpert Yeee...
