dwight_schrute What's this?
jim_halpert Looks like a red wire.
dwight_schrute Hmm. It wasn't here before.
jim_halpert Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
dwight_schrute Yours doesn't.
jim_halpert Doesn't it?
dwight_schrute No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
jim_halpert Dwight, I am really busy, I can't talk about this anymore.
phyllis_vance Dwight, get out of here!
stanley_hudson What are you doing?
jim_halpert I got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by Dunmore High School. 20 bucks for the whole spool. Crazy, what a deal. Oh he'll be fine. I made it up there.
michael_scott What you talking bout, Wallace?
david_wallace Hi Michael how are you?
michael_scott Hi, I am well, how are you?
david_wallace So listen, as you know, we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.
michael_scott Oh, have you not?
david_wallace Correct. And I was wondering if I could get you to do some of the field work that would normally go to the supervisor . There is an area from Carbondale to Marshbrook, where we have never done any business.
michael_scott Yeah.
david_wallace There is a small company there, Prince Paper. I can't get a report on it because it's not a public company. But we have been talking about going after their market, so I was hoping you could do some fact finding for me.
michael_scott Okay.
david_wallace I'll fax over some of the things we're looking for.
michael_scott Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
david_wallace Look, this is important, Michael.
michael_scott Oh, well, then, email it to me.
phyllis_vance You've got no taste Stanley Hudson.
stanley_hudson Oh, I do.
andy_bernard What are you guys talking about?
stanley_hudson Some actress, whether shes hot.
andy_bernard Who is the gal in question?
phyllis_vance Hillary Swank.
creed_bratton Ah, Hillary Swank.
kevin_malone Not at all.
meredith_palmer She's got mean eyes.
pam_beesly Have you seen her with her bangs?
kevin_malone She looks like a monster.
jim_halpert Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
meredith_palmer She is an amazing actress.
kevin_malone That is not the question.
phyllis_vance She's not hot.
kevin_malone Yeah, thank you Phyllis.
jim_halpert Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
angela_martin I'm not voting.
jim_halpert No one cares. Who thinks that Hillary Swank is hot, raise your hand. Okay, and who thinks Hillary Swank is not hot, raise your hand.
kevin_malone Five. Five to five.
jim_halpert Thank you, accounting department.
kevin_malone So what do we do now?
dwight_schrute What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
michael_scott I will seduce her.
dwight_schrute No, I wanna seduce her.
michael_scott No, I will seduce her.
dwight_schrute Please Michael, please.
michael_scott No, I got it.
dwight_schrute You'll fall in love with her.
michael_scott Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
dwight_schrute Okay, let's go over the plan again.
michael_scott Alright, I am a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies
dwight_schrute Your fictitious name?
michael_scott Michael Scarn.
dwight_schrute I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute Then we meet at the Denny's...
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute ...and then we compare notes.
michael_scott No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
dwight_schrute No!
dwight_schrute You know how I feel about IHOP.
michael_scott Oh, don't start,
dwight_schrute Are you socialist?
michael_scott You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
dwight_schrute I'll have a cup of a coffee.
michael_scott You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
dwight_schrute Store only has three employees.
michael_scott So what?
dwight_schrute It means they are not expanding.
michael_scott Maybe they are shrinking.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott They could be shrinking.
dwight_schrute No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
michael_scott Ah ha Yup.
dwight_schrute Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
michael_scott Mm hmm .
dwight_schrute Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
michael_scott And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
dwight_schrute Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
michael_scott Argh, why are you all...
dwight_schrute Get your clouds right.
michael_scott Shut up.
dwight_schrute So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. No, no like this. Good.
michael_scott Ready to do this?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott Good. Here come the sharks.
michael_scott In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.
michael_scott Hello.
all@ Prince family Hello, hi.
michael_scott My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
roger_prince_sr Oh, please come in
michael_scott Thank you.
roger_prince_sr What kind of business are you in.
michael_scott We are a law firm.
roger_prince_sr I assume your primary paper needs are stationary, general office.
michael_scott You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question for you would be how many clients do you have?
roger_prince_sr About 80.
michael_scott Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
roger_prince_sr It's just me, my wife and my son.
michael_scott Ah, so when did you set up shop?
roger_prince_sr I opened this place after I came back from Vietnam.
michael_scott Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .
roger_prince_sr Mmhmm.
andy_bernard Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic Hillary Swank is attractive.
all@ office Hot!
kevin_malone The debate is whether she is hot.
stanley_hudson What difference does it make? Attractive, beautiful, hot, we're talking about the same thing here.
kevin_malone Huge difference. A painting can be beautiful, but I don't want to bang a painting.
andy_bernard Okay, TMI.
michael_scott So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?
roger_prince_sr You sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.
michael_scott Well that is... because... I am a genius.
roger_prince_sr Oh really?
michael_scott Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? Is this the cup? Is this what I drink out of? Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
dwight_schrute Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
roger_prince_sr Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now.
dwight_schrute Why don't you just get rid of this guy?
roger_prince_sr That's my son.
dwight_schrute I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin. I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
michael_scott Try 80.
dwight_schrute Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
roger_prince_sr I sure hope not.
dwight_schrute Me too.
jim_halpert I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.
kevin_malone Are you serious? Jim, just show us a picture.
oscar_martinez Kevin, c'mon.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, shut up Kevin.
kevin_malone He's making all these fancy, uh, it's a gut thing.
jim_halpert Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? Does that end the debate?
kevin_malone No, it's is she hot, not would you do her. Respect the game.
angela_martin Oh my God.
jim_halpert This close.
roger_prince_sr So why are you considering leaving Dunder Mifflin?
dwight_schrute My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings.
michael_scott Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
dwight_schrute It's going very well.
michael_scott Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
linda_prince You want a picture of me?
michael_scott I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left
linda_prince Can I get a copy of that?
linda_prince Grandma, I can't do this.
michael_scott What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
linda_prince Right.
michael_scott Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
linda_prince 8
michael_scott Excellent! Way to go! Nice!
rebecca_prince Don't put that.
kevin_malone Ladies and gentlemen, even though the pen1s was fake, I was expecting a second plot twist where we found out Hilary Swank was a boy.
pam_beesly Kevin!
angela_martin Ok, I wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved, but I don't even get the discussion, hot is a temperature people. But Kevin deserves to lose for what he said, so, yes, she's hot, she's hot as heck, she's a female Boris Becker.
jim_halpert OH!
michael_scott Oh, well thank you very much for all of your help. It's going to be an incredibly hard decision.
roger_prince_sr Wait; let me get something for you. Here is some, some references. Here is a list of references, our top clients. You call any of them; I trust you will hear some good things.
michael_scott I... Okay, okay, okay, alright, thank you.
dwight_schrute Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
michael_scott Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
dwight_schrute Thank you very much.
michael_scott I cannot wait to contact your clients.
dwight_schrute Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls.
roger_prince_sr Bye bye now. So long.
dwight_schrute and Michael Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
michael_scott Haha, we struck the mother load!
dwight_schrute Cmon.
michael_scott Wallace is going to freak.
dwight_schrute All their top clients I can't believe it.
michael_scott He's going to absolutely freak.
dwight_schrute Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go.
michael_scott Oh shoot.
dwight_schrute You drove over that. Go back
michael_scott Oh God, what was that?
dwight_schrute That's not good.
kelly_kapoor No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank!
dwight_schrute Oh my God.
michael_scott Aw, it's alright.
dwight_schrute Oh man,
michael_scott Aw, my car.
dwight_schrute Not good.
roger_prince_sr Is everyone okay?
rebecca_prince It sounded bad.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
dwight_schrute You've done more then you can possibly know.
michael_scott Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
roger_prince_sr A tow truck is going to charge you one hundred bucks to take you a mile. Let me take a look.
michael_scott No, no, really not necessary.
dwight_schrute He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
roger_prince_sr I'll be right back I'm just going to grab my tool box.
pam_beesly Ladies, are we prepared to let the Kevins of the world decide anything for us? Anything at all? We don't even give him full internet access.
kevin_malone Wait, what?
oscar_martinez See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
dwight_schrute How much longer is this going to take?
michael_scott You know let me give you some money for this.
roger_prince_jr No, I work at a desk all day, its nice working with my hands.
michael_scott Oh coffee, that's too much.
dwight_schrute This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
roger_prince_sr Well that outta do it.
linda_prince Its all better.
michael_scott Thank you.
roger_prince_sr Gosh, well so long.
dwight_schrute I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
michael_scott Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
dwight_schrute Goodbye prince family, should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. Bye bye.
dwight_schrute
jim_halpert I'm saying, all I'm saying is Kevin is not necessarily a feminist, is all I'm saying.
pam_beesly No, because...
michael_scott Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
dwight_schrute Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
michael_scott Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
dwight_schrute They could do better.
michael_scott Why don't we just, live and let live?
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott Live and let live.
dwight_schrute I'm not familiar with that expression,
michael_scott It's from James Bond.
dwight_schrute It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
michael_scott I'm not going to make this call.
dwight_schrute Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
michael_scott My heart says...
dwight_schrute Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
michael_scott That is true.
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott Jan... Ryan.
dwight_schrute Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
stanley_hudson I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
dwight_schrute There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
michael_scott You're right.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
dwight_schrute Good, so, where are you going?
michael_scott Just something I have to do first.
dwight_schrute Where are you taking the client list?
michael_scott Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone
dwight_schrute Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No.
michael_scott Oh shoot!
dwight_schrute Freeze, give me the list!
dwight_schrute No no no, I can't let you do this!
michael_scott Those people will be ruined.
dwight_schrute Its business, not personal.
michael_scott Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
dwight_schrute Its over, Michael, its over.
michael_scott Im not a shark.
andy_bernard Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? Okay. And all those opposed?
kevin_malone This is ridiculous.
oscar_martinez That's the thing about debating, you're just going to get people more entrenched in the view they had in the first place.
david_wallace This is good stuff Michael. You are a titan of industry pal.
michael_scott Mpfh.
david_wallace Good work.
michael_scott Thank you.
david_wallace Look I'll be in touch, thanks buddy.
michael_scott Okay, bye bye.
dwight_schrute Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
michael_scott I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
michael_scott Oh, hey what is this?
pam_beesly Hillary swank.
michael_scott Oh, she is hot.
