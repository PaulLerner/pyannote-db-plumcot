david_brent Brent Oh, sorry, mate.
michael_scott Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
david_brent What you doing?
michael_scott English?
david_brent You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
michael_scott Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
david_brent Yeah big time, yeah.
michael_scott I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah.
david_brent Ooh! David Brent, my liege. How are you?
michael_scott Michael Scott.
david_brent Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li . That's what it sounds like.
michael_scott
david_brent Herrow! Herrow!
michael_scott I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
david_brent You can't do that these days. You can't.
michael_scott No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
david_brent No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. . Ohh.
michael_scott That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
david_brent Where are you working?
michael_scott Dunder Mifflin.
david_brent Any jobs now?
michael_scott No, not right now.
david_brent Just let me know.
michael_scott All right. See you around.
david_brent All right.
michael_scott Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
erin_hannon Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
andy_bernard That's actually "Master of Ceremonies" Bernard.
andy_bernard Last year, I went to a seminar called "The Ten Secrets of Real Estate". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
erin_hannon Oh it's...
michael_scott Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
erin_hannon Michael?
michael_scott Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
erin_hannon Ooh. Wait, Michael?
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies.
andy_bernard Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
jim_halpert Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win.
andy_bernard Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
jim_halpert Wow. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
andy_bernard No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
jim_halpert I know.
andy_bernard If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
jim_halpert I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
andy_bernard You can't. You can't.
andy_bernard I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.
jim_halpert Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
pam_beesly What's going on? Do you know that guy?
jim_halpert I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
dwight_schrute Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
dwight_schrute How are the marks?
dwight_schrute What are some of your small business ideas?
Older#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 guy I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.
phyllis_vance Stanley, Dwight Oooh!
dwight_schrute That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
the_minister A lot of mines in Scranton.
dwight_schrute Um, what about you?
Younger#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 Guy Uh, credit cards.
dwight_schrute Uh-huh.
Younger#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 Guy My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.
dwight_schrute Wow!
Younger#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 Guy Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents.
dwight_schrute Right. Okay? Great.
stanley_hudson Great.
dwight_schrute You promised us whales. These are worms.
andy_bernard They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
stanley_hudson I'm out.
andy_bernard Stanley, you're suppose to close.
the_minister I'm out too.
andy_bernard What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
dwight_schrute We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
michael_scott You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know Andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and...
holly_flax Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott Holly broke up with A.J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened... to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
michael_scott If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?
holly_flax Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
michael_scott Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
holly_flax Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
michael_scott Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
erin_hannon Down... there. Is "jlp" a word?
pam_beesly "Jelp?" J-e-l-p?
erin_hannon No, j-l-p. Like, "I jlp... I jlp you!"
pam_beesly I don't think that's a word.
erin_hannon I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
erin_hannon The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen "The Shining", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Ring". Not really my thing. Although, I... I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
pam_beesly You want some help?
erin_hannon Really?
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
erin_hannon Yes.
pam_beesly K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean?
oscar_martinez It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"?
erin_hannon Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo", I'm playing "milk". Whatever it takes.
oscar_martinez Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood". Would have played a...
erin_hannon Uh...
oscar_martinez A triple word.
erin_hannon Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
oscar_martinez Or moon.
erin_hannon The cow jumped over the moon.
oscar_martinez She's stuck on that one thing.
pam_beesly No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
andy_bernard Kevin, Jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just... I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
kevin_malone Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm Jim is in the movie version when Jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
andy_bernard Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.
kevin_malone Then I won't let you down.
kelly_kapoor Cake.
ryan_howard In you go.
andy_bernard Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
ryan_howard Yup.
andy_bernard I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
ryan_howard And?
andy_bernard Can you do it?
ryan_howard Okay. I don't... I don't like committing to things just like that.
andy_bernard So no?
ryan_howard No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
kelly_kapoor Oh, baby.
andy_bernard What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
ryan_howard Yes.
andy_bernard All right!
ryan_howard Yes, I'll do it.
andy_bernard Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
ryan_howard And if I flake, I flake.
andy_bernard What?
andy_bernard Kevin, you open it up.
kevin_malone Yep.
andy_bernard Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then Creed guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
kevin_malone Go.
creed_bratton Creed! Ha!
andy_bernard Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is Andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog.
Older#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 Woman Hi Nard Dog. I'm Lu Peachem.
andy_bernard Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program... first up is a speech called, "Don't Just Dream it, do it." Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. Kevin Malone.
kevin_malone Yes!
kevin_malone There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
kevin_malone Dream... big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c... an. And then double it! .
andy_bernard Are you okay?
kevin_malone No. Yes!
andy_bernard Here...
kevin_malone No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. . Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way!
andy_bernard I'm really excited to introduce you guys to Ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last...
kelly_kapoor But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
andy_bernard What are you...
kelly_kapoor Who am I? I'm Kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
kelly_kapoor It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. "The Business Bitch", "The Diet Bitch", "The Shopping Bitch", "The Etiquette Bitch."
kelly_kapoor I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing.
meredith_palmer Powell Hey, Kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise.
kelly_kapoor Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone.
meredith_palmer Powell Uh, why?
kelly_kapoor Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business?
meredith_palmer Powell Um, there aren't really ten secrets.
kelly_kapoor Come on Scott, please? It's me.
meredith_palmer Powell Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline.
kelly_kapoor Mm-hmm.
andy_bernard That brilliant little bitch.
oscar_martinez A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that "q" right there.
erin_hannon Wait. Why?
oscar_martinez Put the "q" there, sweetie.
pam_beesly I think there's better...
oscar_martinez Put the "q" there! Sorry I yelled.
pam_beesly You could have just told us what you were thinking.
oscar_martinez There's no theater in that.
pam_beesly There's no yelling in that, either.
oscar_martinez Well...
holly_flax What do you do in your free time?
michael_scott Practice Olympics.
holly_flax Mmm. Do you like movies?
michael_scott I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home".
holly_flax We have to try this out on somebody.
michael_scott Hello.
hank Look, you want to order something?
michael_scott She will have a greekaccino.
hank I don't know what that is.
michael_scott It...
holly_flax It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
michael_scott I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
holly_flax No more brain damage.
michael_scott No more brain damage!
holly_flax Ahh!
holly_flax I don't know.
andy_bernard Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is... Creed Bratton.
creed_bratton Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a pen1s. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one question Why are you here?
andy_bernard Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.
gabe_lewis I picked out our movie. It's called "Suspiria". It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
erin_hannon When I win...
gabe_lewis Ooh.
erin_hannon We're gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
gabe_lewis It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
dwight_schrute So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 Well, I started my own golf supply company.
dwight_schrute Really?
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth.
dwight_schrute Phyllis?
the_minister Hmm?
dwight_schrute Some of these people are for real.
dwight_schrute Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
andy_bernard Thank you.
dwight_schrute Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
andy_bernard Really?
darryl_philbin Ahem!
andy_bernard Excuse me.
dwight_schrute I got it. I got it.
andy_bernard Hey, do you need a lozenge?
darryl_philbin They're a bunch of jackals.
andy_bernard What?
darryl_philbin They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
andy_bernard Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
andy_bernard Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
dwight_schrute You're gonna blow it.
andy_bernard Maybe. Only maybe.
oscar_martinez We got it! Wow! We got it!
pam_beesly Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if Erin puts the last word in herself.
oscar_martinez Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
erin_hannon Yes.
oscar_martinez Ah. No! . Although I must say, I will have "apoplexy" if you lose. Do you understand? "Apoplexy" is what I will have.
erin_hannon Apoplexy.
oscar_martinez Yes.
erin_hannon Got it. Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
erin_hannon I played "ape."
jim_halpert I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
andy_bernard Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so...
michael_scott Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. All, you have to close right now.
andy_bernard Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it.
michael_scott No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
andy_bernard Yeah, yeah.
michael_scott Andy, what's the problem?
andy_bernard This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
michael_scott You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. What is taking that guy so long?
jim_halpert Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
pam_beesly I don't know. They're still in there.
jim_halpert Ohh! Good-bye.
pam_beesly Stop. Out with it.
pam_beesly Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
jim_halpert Tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
pam_beesly And when they were both in the third grade, Jim was placed in the top reading group.
jim_halpert I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
pam_beesly And Tom...
jim_halpert Was in the green group.
pam_beesly And Jim's mom suggested that Jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
jim_halpert And that's what I told him.
pam_beesly Right. But how'd you say it?
jim_halpert "My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with."
andy_bernard Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now?
Older#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode13 Woman I'll take one.
andy_bernard Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? Sold! Anybody else? Yes! All right!
kelly_kapoor Yeah bitch.
andy_bernard Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
michael_scott No, no, no.
andy_bernard But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
kelly_kapoor Whoo!
korean_woman_2 Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda?
jim_halpert Yeah, woah. Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
korean_woman_2 Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
korean_woman_2 How's it goin'?
jim_halpert Pretty good.
korean_woman_2 It's been a while.
jim_halpert It has been, yeah.
korean_woman_2 So you work here, huh?
jim_halpert Sales.
korean_woman_2 Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory.
jim_halpert
korean_woman_2 'Cause you're so smart.
jim_halpert Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
korean_woman_2 Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius.
jim_halpert All right, good catch-up.
korean_woman_2 Yeah.
jim_halpert See ya.
korean_woman_2 Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg?
dwight_schrute Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
andy_bernard Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.
holly_flax Wonderful seminar!
michael_scott Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
holly_flax Michael, I should get back to work.
michael_scott What? Come on. It's time for grapes. Real fun day.
gabe_lewis So, I won.
erin_hannon I know. You get to pick.
gabe_lewis Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch "Wall-e".
erin_hannon Yes?
gabe_lewis So I got us a compromise. This movie's called "Hardware". It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and... married...
andy_bernard Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
erin_hannon There's a "Shrek" two?!
andy_bernard Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.
gabe_lewis Nice guy.
erin_hannon Ohh.
