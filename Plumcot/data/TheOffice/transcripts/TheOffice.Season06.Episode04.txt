pam_beesly I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?
jim_halpert We would really appreciate it.
dwight_schrute Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
pam_beesly Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.
phyllis_vance Now this is getting ridiculous.
dwight_schrute Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
meredith_palmer All morning I look forward to my afternoon cigars and I'm not stopping for anyone.
pam_beesly I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.
andy_bernard Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...
michael_scott What do you think? I spent all morning on it.
jim_halpert It is really special.
pam_beesly Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.
michael_scott It's just a really important day for me.
jim_halpert Well, congrats.
michael_scott Thanks.
erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin Scranton will be closed today and Friday for a company wedding in Niagara Falls. So, please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. Have a great day.
jim_halpert Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.
kevin_malone So... you're going to provide them, then?
jim_halpert No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
kevin_malone What the hell?
dwight_schrute Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
pam_beesly Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.
jim_halpert Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
angela_martin Decent people everywhere will get offended.
pam_beesly Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.
angela_martin Well, you're lucky you have a grandmother. Some of us have to be our own grandmothers.
jim_halpert That's nice.
pam_beesly You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.
angela_martin Really, Pam...
michael_scott Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time.
angela_martin Ow! He pinched me!
michael_scott No.
pam_beesly Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.
dwight_schrute We'll see.
pam_beesly Thank you, Dwight.
jim_halpert Good-bye.
pam_beesly See you later.
michael_scott And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
andy_bernard What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara.
michael_scott Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
andy_bernard No... I didn't steal your joke.
michael_scott Yes. I said that yesterday.
dwight_schrute But you can say that about anything.
michael_scott Dwight...
dwight_schrute What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
kevin_malone Oh yeah.
michael_scott No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.
dwight_schrute It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
michael_scott This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
michael_scott Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.
dwight_schrute I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
michael_scott Get out of here.
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott Oh, my God, Dwight.
dwight_schrute For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
michael_scott There's... a name.
dwight_schrute Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
michael_scott Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
dwight_schrute Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
cindy_halpert Ok.
dwight_schrute She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
michael_scott Is that all you have on her?
dwight_schrute Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
michael_scott You're an idiot.
kevin_malone People don't think of me as one of the sharper dressers in the office... but I'm going ot turn that around at this wedding. I thought, how could I take it to the next level? The hair. It's the hair-- Ok. Ok. I'm going. God.
andy_bernard Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to? It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.
kelly_kapoor This is so much cooler. We feel like wer're in a limo and you're our driver.
andy_bernard Mmm-hmm. Erin?
erin_hannon Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
andy_bernard Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.
pam_beesly Hey, my aunt told me something neat.
jim_halpert Yeah?
pam_beesly She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
jim_halpert Oh, wow. That's cool.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert Lousy Picture.
pam_beesly We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
michael_scott Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
dwight_schrute What? No way!
michael_scott Those glasses are super dark.
dwight_schrute Oh. God.
michael_scott Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
dwight_schrute You know what? I made you a cd...
michael_scott You did?
dwight_schrute Mmm-hmm.
michael_scott That was nice of you.
dwight_schrute This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
michael_scott Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
dwight_schrute You're gonna like this. "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--"
michael_scott Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
dwight_schrute Yeah. It's practical.
michael_scott No. No. That's not how it works.
jim_halpert Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Halpert...
jim_halpert And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Great.
jim_halpert I know. We're pretty excited, too.
pam_beesly Can we take a look at the suite now?
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Oh, I'm sorry. Somebody just checked in.
pam_beesly Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Oh, no. Just an individual. That man over there.
andy_bernard Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed.
jim_halpert I don't like that.
pam_beesly I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.
michael_scott Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk One moment while I check.
dwight_schrute The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
michael_scott Mmm-hmm.
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not seeing you in here. When did you make your reservation?
michael_scott I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number Romeo. Tango. G7745.
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Yes. Schrute.
dwight_schrute And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Sure. No problem.
dwight_schrute Ok.
hotel_receptionist Desk Clerk Here's your key, Mr. Schrute.
michael_scott Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
dwight_schrute No way. What if I meet someone?
michael_scott I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.
dwight_schrute No. No.
michael_scott I would do the same for you.
dwight_schrute You would?
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Really?
michael_scott Yes... just go--
dwight_schrute Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
michael_scott Oh. Thank God.
dwight_schrute Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
michael_scott Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
dwight_schrute Please?
michael_scott If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
dwight_schrute Mmm-hmm.
michael_scott Ok.
dwight_schrute Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
michael_scott I don't have a room?
dwight_schrute No you do not.
michael_scott Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
dwight_schrute It worked.
michael_scott Jerk.
michael_scott When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet.
stanley_hudson Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Hudson.
michael_scott Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
stanley_hudson Are you crazy? I brought Cynthia with me.
michael_scott Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
stanley_hudson I got one queen size bed.
michael_scott You... are... kidding me.
stanley_hudson A queen size bed is five feet wide. I am not five feet wide, Michael.
michael_scott I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
erin_hannon Oh. Gross.
kelly_kapoor Blow my brains out.
michael_scott That's rude.
toby_flenderson Michael, I have one extra twin bed, if you want.
michael_scott You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
creed_bratton Halpert So, which one is Pam's grandma?
pam_beesly Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.
jim_halpert Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
creed_bratton Halpert No.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
jim_halpert Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.
creed_bratton Halpert Oh.
michael_scott How ya doin'?
creed_bratton Halpert Hi.
michael_scott Nice to meet you.
creed_bratton Halpert Nice to meet you.
michael_scott Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
jim_halpert Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
michael_scott That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
jim_halpert Pretty sure everyone heard that.
michael_scott Didn't move my lips.
pam_beesly Hey, Mema.
sylvia I wasn't sure about your branch of the family. After I heard about your parent's divorce. But you and Jim are just perfect. God bless you.
pam_beesly Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.
sylvia Well... I wouldn't care to live if I thought that.
jim_halpert Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
creed_bratton Beesly I'd like you to meet Christy Kelly.
jim_halpert Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
creed_bratton Beesly No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?
dwight_schrute From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
Little#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode04 Girl Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter?
dwight_schrute Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
Kids#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode04 Ewwww!
dwight_schrute That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
pam_beesly Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister, Penny. She's also my maid of honor.
oscar_martinez Pleased to meet you.
penny_beesly I'm sorry, it's Kevin. I thought it was Gil?
kevin_malone She thought I was your boyfriend.
oscar_martinez You thought I was dating this? What the hell is wrong with you?
pam_beesly Oscar, it was an honest mistake.
oscar_martinez Him? Him?
kevin_malone Oscar, I would be proud to date you.
penny_beesly I'm sorry.
kevin_malone I'm not gay. I'm Kevin.
penny_beesly Nice to meet you, Kevin.
kevin_malone Yes.
oscar_martinez You owe me and apology.
penny_beesly I'm so sorry.
kevin_malone Are you seeing anyone right now?
pam_beesly She has a boyfriend. He's out of town.
kevin_malone Cool.
ryan_howard I was the youngest VP in the company history.
meredith_palmer More recently, he worked in a bowling alley. Tell her one of your funny bowling alley stories.
ryan_howard Um... also--
andy_bernard How did Meredith get put at the young people's table?
kevin_malone She probably switched cards with someone. Like I did with Erin.
andy_bernard What? You're kid-- That's-- You're--
isabel_poreba Jim and Pam, I can't tell you how happy I am to be here.
michael_scott Head table, where I belong.
dwight_schrute It's just for family.
michael_scott Well, who's that one?
dwight_schrute Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
michael_scott What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
dwight_schrute That's a very good record.
pete_halpert Alright, so I'll be like, 'You're so sweet guys and so kind'.
tom_halpert That's when I'll do the face, like-
pete_halpert Like, 'What? What?'. And then we'll just give him a little punch in the back and--
tom_halpert A noogie?
pete_halpert You know what? Never too married for a noogie.
michael_scott They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.
tom_halpert Pam, you've got the greatest smile and you're body is really fine.
pete_halpert Smoking.
tom_halpert Hoping it'll make our wives take it up a notch.
pete_halpert A little mo' cardio.
michael_scott That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
dwight_schrute Knight Rider.
michael_scott That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
dwight_schrute Very smart.
michael_scott And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott Yeah. Go ahead.
jim_halpert Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
pete_halpert Douche.
jim_halpert Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
pam_beesly Like... a year.
jim_halpert I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
sylvia What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink?
jim_halpert Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
michael_scott Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--
sylvia They were living together?
michael_scott Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.
jim_halpert Michael.
michael_scott When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.
jim_halpert Oh, my God. Please.
michael_scott When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
pam_beesly Michael.
michael_scott ...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
pam_beesly Michael. Stop.
michael_scott Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott Jim.
jim_halpert To waiting.
all@ To waiting.
sylvia I should have known. The hotels television set had a movie on called "Bruno" last night. The remote control had so darn many buttons on it, I couldn't turn it off. So I had to just sit there while it happened to me. I wondered, 'How could they pick such a hotel?' Hmmm. Now I know.
pam_beesly Mema.
michael_scott That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.
jim_halpert I can't believe it was me.
michael_scott I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
jim_halpert Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
michael_scott I have not found that to be the case.
pam_beesly Hey, smooth guys.
jim_halpert I'm so sorry.
michael_scott Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
pam_beesly Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.
jim_halpert Oh, my God. Are you serious?
michael_scott There's gonna be a free room?
michael_scott Hi, Mema. It's Michael.
sylvia Oh. You're that foul guy that kept talking about intercourse.
michael_scott Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
michael_scott I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.
sylvia I want to go to bed but I can't. I can't turn that television off.
michael_scott Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there.
sylvia Oh. Thank you.
michael_scott You're welcome.
sylvia It was that horrible Charlie Rose.
michael_scott Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have s*x before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have s*x and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.
sylvia People are like cats and dogs these days.
michael_scott Exactly.
sylvia This used to be such a great country.
michael_scott I know.
sylvia I don't know what happened to it.
michael_scott They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.
sylvia You mean, Sylvia.
michael_scott Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.
andy_bernard Partay. Room 639.
kevin_malone Yes!
andy_bernard Chicks are gonna be off the hook. Guys, too, Oscar. Like Calvin Klein models.
kevin_malone That sounds epic. Can we bring anything?
andy_bernard Nothing. Except $40 for beer and any hot chicks you know. 'Cause that would help me deliver on some promises I made. Woo!
andy_bernard No one from the office has been to a real Bernard throw down.
andy_bernard If I was girl, I would seriously reconsdier coming to this party. But don't tell anyone that I said that, 'cause I want them to come.
angela_martin And where do you think you're going?
pam_beesly I was just going to go down to the hotel bar for a little bit.
angela_martin Well, why don't I just save you some time and kick you in the stomach instead?
pam_beesly I just wanted to get out of my room for a little while.
angela_martin Mmm-hmm. Ok. I'll go with you. Come on.
pam_beesly Nevermind.
angela_martin Are you sure?
pam_beesly Yeah.
angela_martin It'll be fun.
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott What are you wearing?
dwight_schrute What? It's a casual, social outfit.
michael_scott Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
dwight_schrute No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during s*x.
michael_scott Ok. That's not appropriate. Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go.
kevin_malone It's a good idea.
oscar_martinez It's not a good idea. There's no such thing as a good hairpiece.
kevin_malone Yeah. But that's easy enough for you to say, Oscar. You have that thick, beautiful, Chicano hair. So nice.
dwight_schrute I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
michael_scott Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
isabel_poreba Wait. You're worried about your horses? That's cool. How many horses do you have?
dwight_schrute Nine and three-quarters.
dwight_schrute I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
