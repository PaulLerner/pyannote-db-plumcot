jan So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
pam Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about. um. I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
jan women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So.
michael Hey, what's going on?
jan Michael. I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
michael Yeah. I. You know what. I. I. I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
jan What are you doing?
michael Hold. Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads.
jan Michael.
michael No, just uh. you have come a long way, baby. But I just. just want to keep it within reason.
jan Michael.
michael They did this up in Albany.
jan You are not allowed in this session.
michael And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so.
jan Now you're really not allowed in this session.
michael Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like.
jan I'm your boss.
michael Anybody want any coffee or.
jan We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
michael women in the workplace. yeah, translation "I have been banned from my own conference room so that jan can talk in secret to all the girls. " Oh! Sorry. 'women of the workplace. ' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
jan Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I. I. really apologize.
pam Jan.
jan Yes, Pam?
pam Michael's still at the door.
jan Michael!
jan So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. men who are assertive will be admired. They're called. anyone?
dwight It's a terrible idea.
jim What is?
dwight Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
michael Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy. too. sort of. Let's do this!
michael Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.
michael Let's just clap. Ready? Yeah! Yeah!
dwight Yeah!
michael That's what I'm talking about!
jan I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
michael Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
jan . but it's very destructive.
michael Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
jan Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
michael We have nowhere else Jan. This.
dwight We could do it in the warehouse.
jan Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
michael OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
michael Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.
dwight Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
jan I'm so sorry about that. um. so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
pam Mmmhmm.
jan Please? Thank you. very much.
michael So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
darryl My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
michael You know, darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's roy riding the big rig. So roy is actually going to be marrying pam sometime this summer. And. uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
roy Why?
michael Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina. Roy.
roy I don't understand.
michael roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
kevin I bet roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
jim Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
kevin I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
michael Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little "Good Will Hunting" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
jan Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
meredith Hi. I'm meredith and I'm an alch. good at supplier relations.
jan Great. Phyllis?
phyllis I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
angela Really?
phyllis I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that.
jan No. Okay. Stop. Go on.
angela I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
phyllis Really? I thought they were pretty.
pam I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um. I mean we get along great. Fine. Um. I guess the person I have the most in common with is.
roy Jim. Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
jim Oh, no, no. No.
roy No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so. you know. We're cool, right?
jim Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
roy You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
jim Yeah. I like talking to her too.
roy So, we're cool, right?
jim Yes. Yeah.
roy All right.
jim Yep. Cool, man.
roy Sweet.
kevin 
darryl Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
michael Oh. well. okay. yeah, you know what? I don't think. You. You're. My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.
darryl The experience.
michael Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
dwight Okay. Let's go. Step up.
michael Check this out! Look at that! Look at that bwup-bwa! Hello! How are. Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
meredith In five years, I'd like to be. five years sober.
jan That is an excellent goal.
meredith Four and a half.
kelly I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
jan Great! Uh-huh?
kelly I want an SUV. with three rows of seats.
women 
jan Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
dwight michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
jim Ponies.
dwight No.
ryan How about rainbows?
dwight No.
jim Flowers.
darryl It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
michael Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.
darryl Mike.
michael Stand clear.
darryl Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
michael I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
darryl Look, would ya. look.
michael Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up.
darryl We're the ones that got to clean that up!
lonny Dammit, Michael!
michael We ought to have this thing serviced.
michael So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so.
madge Hey, do you want me to go?
michael No, why? Why would I. ? You could.
madge I'll go.
michael Stay or.
phyllis . and a big walk-in closet.
meredith Oh, that's part of my dream too.
kelly Oh, me too.
jan Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
pam Well. I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it. stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um. More seriously though, a husband that I love. Roy. And I love to draw. And I. I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
phyllis She's real good.
pam Thanks.
jan You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
pam Well. I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off.
jan Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
pam Well. it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um.
jan There are always a million reasons not to do something. . push;
michael Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
darryl My priority is safety.
michael OK.
darryl So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
michael OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh.
darryl Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
michael I. That was just.
darryl That bothers me too.
michael I was breathing.
roy pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
michael I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the. ok. what is our beef as human men.
lonny You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?
michael OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do. and we love it.
jan All right. Let's talk about clothing.
phyllis I'm excited about today. I love girl talk.
jan Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
angela I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, jan aspires to be a whore.
roy I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like "When are we going to go on a date-date?"
guy I hate that too!
darryl I hate that too.
kevin That sucks so much.
guy It totally sucks.
dwight Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas ain't free!"
lonny Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.
michael I feel you.
darryl No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
dwight Not literally.
darryl You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
michael Yes.
darryl We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
michael Ah, you do. So.
darryl But we get paid a lot less.
dwight Word.
roy Like next to no benefits.
michael I know. God! What is that?
roy Exactly.
michael It blows. It blows, man. Gah.
darryl You know this would not happen if we had a union.
roy That's what I'm talking about.
michael No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
roy Absolutely.
darryl That's what we need.
guy You know you're right.
darryl Man, see. That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
michael You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union. of guys.
darryl It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
roy In my truck.
michael Dockworker's?
darryl Man, hook you up.
men 
guy Come on, man.
michael Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
darryl Union! Union, yeah.
michael The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
darryl Are you with us Mike?
michael Yeah-es.
darryl Welcome to the warehouse. Group
chant Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi.
jan Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before.
michael This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna. Can I help you? Um. I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points.
jan What? A union! What.
michael Don't get hysterical.
jan I'm not.
michael Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
michael Let's. be. rational. here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
jan The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think. the. pros. are. here?
michael Don't talk to me that way please. Just. they're going to want to hear this from you.
jan You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
michael But we're bonding down there!
jan That's too bad.
michael I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
jan I don't want to.
michael Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through.
jan Michael! Michael! Michael!
michael We have a history.
jan Michael.
michael . between us.
jan Don't say another word.
michael I won't
jan Get yourself down stairs.
michael I'm just saying we have something. Ok. Whatever.
ryan You know what. we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
stanley This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
jan Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a . many women ask to go over it. So. Fumble means.
phyllis Mistake.
meredith Slip.
jan Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait. that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
kelly What about second base? Like if michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
jan Excuse me?
kelly I mean that's a baseball term, right?
jan I don't know what michael was talking about. I don't know.
kelly . and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
jan Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
kelly He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term.
pam Hey.
jim Hey!
pam How's it going down there?
jim It's a complete. well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so. How are the girls?
pam Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
jim Did you really?
pam No.
jim Oh.
pam Almost.
jim Good.
pam Um. but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
jim Nice. Well, what's it all about?
pam Um.
jim I think you should do it. That's great!
pam It's really cool.
michael Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey, Darryl. You ever done this?
angela Are you married?
jan I'm divorced.
phyllis That must have been hard.
jan It was. Yes.
kelly You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
jan I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
phyllis Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
angela At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
jan Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
kelly How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
michael Hi.
jan Did you take care of the situation?
michael Yuh, yuh, yes! I. I have essentially.
jan Excuse me.
michael I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some.
jan Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to. to Michael.
pam Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but. um. I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
jim So you're not doing it.
pam How did you know?
jim Why not?
pam Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
jim Come on.
pam Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
jim roy said that.
pam What? You have something you want to say?
jim You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
pam Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
jim You are?
pam Yeah.
pam It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um. they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to. .
michael I'm just going to put this over there.
darryl This is not a good idea right here.
michael You did uh. okay.
michael Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?
michael Hey. Um. look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes jan can be such a bitch. All the
men Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.
michael Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
michael Thank you to our hosts.
darryl Hey Michael. This ain't over.
michael Ahhh! Excellent.
michael Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
pam Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh. hold, please.
