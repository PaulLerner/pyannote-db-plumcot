kevin To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
jim I think they're going to the conference finals.
kevin No.
jim Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-.
jim I bit my lip at lunch today.
darryl Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough. The Nets are tough.
kevin Oh, the Nets are super tough.
jim Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
kevin The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
jim Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the.
jim Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen. You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
erin Good morning, Meredith.
pam What?
erin Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
pam Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
jim I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
jim You sound tired. Everything ok?
pam Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
jim Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
worker Jim, limo's here.
jim Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
pam Oh, call me later!
jim Ok
pam Good luck!
jim Thanks!
pam Love you.
jim Love you too. Bye.
val How you doing?
darryl Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so.
val It's how it has to be.
darryl I know, I know. It's just hard.
darryl Me and val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, "What are you gonna do, breakup with me?" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
darryl I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
val Me neither. Come here.
pam Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
meredith Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder jim left you.
pam He didn't leave me. He just went part time. Can you just fill out the form please?
meredith Yes.
pam I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way meredith just did, but it happens.
meredith Hurry up already.
erin Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
erin Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
angela Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
dwight What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
pam Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.
dwight Just lice Pam?
dwight Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
dwight Make way, nope, inspect me.
erin Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
dwight Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.
pam Stop that!
angela Dwight!
erin Next!
angela Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
pam Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
oscar Pam, really? Come on.
meredith Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
erin Lice. More lice. angela has lice.
angela Ew! Oh.
erin Ooh yabber, lice!
erin Yikers, lice.
pam No! How? I'm so clean!
erin Oh yeah, big time lice.
oscar I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
phyllis What are you wearing?
dwight It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
nellie No.
kevin No.
dwight Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
darryl Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
phyllis You got dumped?
darryl Yeah, she ended things.
nellie Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
kevin Here man. You need that more than me.
darryl Thanks, man.
kevin Yeah
pam Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
angela Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
stanley That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
erin No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house!
stanley Get off me!
erin I'm trying to save you from yourself!
stanley Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
pam Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
jim Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary? Limo
driver Yeah, take some home if you want.
jim Oh no, no, no. That's ok. Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center? Limo
driver No, Mr. irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court.
jim You gotta be kidding me.
pam Hey, meredith I need to tell you something.
meredith Yes, pam what do you want?
pam Oh my God, meredith what are you doing!?
meredith Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
pam Oh stop! I am so sorry!
meredith Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
pam Nothing.
pam I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
dwight Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
erin No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats.
dwight To be burned!
erin To be washed.
angela What do we do about our heads?
dwight I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
erin No, all we need is mayonnaise.
angela Excuse me?
pam She's right, it works. I would imagine.
erin Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
oscar I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
meredith Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
angela Oh.
oscar Wow.
meredith Take a picture. It will last longer.
angela We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
creed Bald people make me sick.
meredith Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
erin Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks. It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
pam Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.
angela Okay. Oh, thank you.
oscar You're a saint, Pam.
pam No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or. or one of those stylish turbans?
meredith Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
pam Okay.
dwight Let's talk pubes, people. . push;
val Hey, Darryl.
darryl Oh, hey Val.
nellie Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
darryl Yeah.
phyllis What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
darryl When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
nellie Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
kevin I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
phyllis Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
nellie Listen, let's try and get darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
kevin An Escalade.
nellie Or what's her name.
phyllis Val.
nellie Let's get darryl Val. julius
irving I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk.
jim Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
julius Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?
jim Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
julius Okay. Wow, Halpert's got game.
jim Alright. Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
julius It's your wife? You better take it.
jim Right! Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
pam Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
jim It's still happening right now actually, so uh.
pam He's really making you work for it, huh?
jim Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
pam Great. I am killing it over here. Jim, I gotta go.
jim Okay, bye. So sorry about that.
julius No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think?
jim I love it.
erin Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
dwight Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.
stanley Put those away before you hurt yourself.
dwight Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
erin Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
angela Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
oscar Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to.
creed Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
erin Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm. I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
pete Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
pam Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?
creed Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
oscar Angela.
angela You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
meredith You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
pam Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
creed I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
pam Well, wait.
pete How's that?
erin I feel it working. Eiffel tower!
val Can I help you?
phyllis Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
val Yeah, that's true.
phyllis We think you made a big, big mistake.
kevin Big mistake.
nellie Quite enormous.
phyllis He's a real catch and you should take him back.
val Ok, thank you. Is that all?
nellie No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
val Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
kevin So does this mean you're gonna take darryl back?
val No.
kevin Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
val Yeah, kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then kevin asked me out.
pam Hello?
helene Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. She still has lice.
pam What, no. That can't. I don't.
helene Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like.
angela Oh my God.
meredith Shave her head. Shave her head!
pam You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with jim gone, that.
meredith Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
dwight She's right Pam.
pam Is there a volume knob on that thing?
dwight Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
pam Meredith, I am so sorry.
angela Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
pam I meant to say something earlier. I just.
meredith Just? Just what? Just forgot?
meredith Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
dwight Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as.
erin Dwight, are you okay!?
dwight Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.
erin Wow. He got to purple.
oscar Ow!
angela Sorry.
oscar You're waterboarding me!
angela Oops.
kevin No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
erin You're up.
pete Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
erin You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
pete Okay.
erin Okay. Okay. Is that too cold?
pete No, it actually feels kinda nice.
kevin I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time.
val Okay.
darryl Huh?
val Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
darryl Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just. I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
val You're not. I believe in us.
darryl But.
darryl I'm back together with Val. Yay.
dwight I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere.
pete Hey, did erin already take off?
oscar I guess so.
pete Okay.
julius You're Kareem, coming to help.
jim Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
julius And it went like this.
jim And that's all?
julius That's it.
jim No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
julius Yeah, you show me how.
jim This is jim Halpert, leave a message.
pam Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
meredith Hey, what you doing right now?
pam I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
meredith Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
pam Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
meredith No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
pam Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
meredith Forget about it.
pam I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
meredith Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
pam Get it, girl!
pam This one's for all you ladies out there.
meredith I come.
pam Not yet.
both I come home in the middle of the night. My mother says when you gonna live your life right? Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones. And girls, they want to have fun. Oh girls just want to have fun.
