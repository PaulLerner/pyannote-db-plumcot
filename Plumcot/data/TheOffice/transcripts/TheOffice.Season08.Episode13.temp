andy Val, I need the space.
val all right guys, clear out.
andy Everybody out.
val Promise me you're going to clean up.
andy I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
val Promise me that-
andy Obviously I'm going to clean up.
andy Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, "Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance, " and then you have to be like, "Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!" And then. we dance. Oh how we dance. s*x also works.
erin Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
andy Hey! Tuna! He's back.
jim Hey.
andy Oh, look at this. Tuna wrap.
jim Okay.
andy Hand roll.
jim Yeah.
phyllis How was jury duty?
jim It was pretty uneventful, actually.
dwight Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
erin What was the case?
jim Uh, hit and run.
erin Ooh, "the case of the hit and run, " that's exciting.
phyllis Did you send him to the slammer?
jim Nope. Not guilty.
dwight Of course you found him not guilty. "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm. "
jim We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
dwight Not coming, have plans.
jim Okay.
jim I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
erin Ah! angela had the baby!
kevin Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
darryl Why?
kevin You know.
darryl Would it be more hilarious than angela having a Chinese baby?
kevin A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
ryan Eh, a little bit.
kevin Oh, did I win the pool?
erin Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
oscar Well no one won the pool. angela wasn't due for another month.
erin We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
phyllis Oh, I'd love to but, um-
jim Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
oscar Well kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
kevin Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
gabe Everyone, our very own Angela-
oscar We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
gabe Oh, I am so in.
gabe I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
andy Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
jim Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
meredith How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
stanley Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
phyllis Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
jim Wow, I'm really sorry.
phyllis Yeah.
jim I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
jim So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
toby You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
jim Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
toby You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
meredith Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
dwight I was in Los Angeles last year. jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
oscar Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
kevin Got that, bimbo?
erin Got it, bimbo.
angela Yes?
oscar Knock, knock. Oh!
kevin Hi!
angela Oh. I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
oscar We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite. Senator
lipton Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton.
kevin Phillip is so fat.
oscar Kevin!
kevin You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
angela Hey. Senator
lipton Yes, he's substantial.
erin He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
dwight So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop.
jim Mm-hmm.
dwight And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
jim Mm-hmm.
dwight See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. Busted, Halpert!
jim Okay, wait, wait.
dwight Yes! Andy, get out here.
jim No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
dwight I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
andy What's up, gangstas?
dwight jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
andy Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
dwight I have jim on the record saying that the vic-
andy No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
dwight I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
andy Here, right there. Down the hatch.
dwight I really don't want to take the chill pill.
andy Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.
dwight Okay, okay. But let's just say that jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
andy Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu.
dwight That's good enough for me.
jim . and pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
andy I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
jim Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
andy No, not after what I told dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
jim No.
andy Do you know why you never heard of it?
jim No.
andy Covered it up.
jim Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
andy They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
andy My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
ernesto Where you want I park?
dwight Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you.
toby Ernesto!
ernesto Hola Toby!
toby Yeah, hey.
ernesto Como esta?
nate Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah, " I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah, " but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby. " "I remember Toby. "
dwight Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
jim Uh-
toby It's the empanada guy.
jim The empanada guy!
dwight No, Toby! Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. Ask him if he remembers Jim.
ernesto No.
nate He says, "No. "
dwight He says, "No!" Boom!
andy Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
dwight Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.
nate Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
jim Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
creed Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
dwight Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
andy Why? Everybody's heard it.
dwight Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
andy Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
phyllis Why?
andy Why? Why?
jim Because my car broke down.
andy His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
dwight Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
andy Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
phyllis I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
andy We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
jim Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
andy I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your .
jim Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
andy I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
oscar Wow, it's so. healthy.
kevin I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
angela No, you will not.
erin Is he really five pounds?
angela Mm-hmm.
erin Because I squat with five pounds. This- yeah, this feels like more than that. Senator
lipton No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces.
angela Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
oscar Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but- Senator
lipton Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park.
angela Aw, preemie pajamas!
oscar Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
angela No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
kevin I got Little kevin Call of Duty. . push;
oscar This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
jim Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
stanley What?
jim Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
dwight You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
stanley What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
jim pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
dwight Your clients. They're all mine.
darryl Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
andy Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
dwight all right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself.
andy Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
dwight No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
andy I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye.
dwight That's it? This is crap!
gabe You've reached gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao.
dwight Gabe, it's dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
dwight I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what jim did and let the little stickler do what he does
best stickle.
angela Shh.
oscar Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
angela It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
oscar The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
angela Ah!
kevin Little Kevin.
angela Really?
oscar Angela.
angela Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
oscar I knew that, I knew it.
angela The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
oscar Chicken marsala.
angela Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
oscar Mm-hmm.
angela And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
oscar Dwight. Hey.
dwight Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
oscar He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
dwight Okay.
oscar Don't you want to see the baby?
dwight Psh! Why? I know what angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
oscar I promised I wouldn't tell.
dwight So don't.
oscar angela got pregnant before the wedding.
dwight What?
oscar She got pregnant before the wedding.
dwight How long before?
oscar A month. You didn't hear it from me!
dwight Yes I did.
angela Dwight? Senator
lipton Dwight.
dwight I want to see the baby.
erin Oh, angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
dwight Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions. willingly, or as slaves.
dwight That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose s*x, that baby is mine.
angela He's hungry. Senator
lipton Oh, that's my cue to leave.
angela No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover. Senator
lipton Still. Still.
angela You won't see-
jim You want a giraffe?
jim Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
pam Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
jim Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
pam Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
jim Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
pam Oh, hi Stanley.
jim Split the difference?
pam Jim.
jim Okay, let's go.
pam Hey.
erin Hi.
pam Hi everybody!
jim What?
all Hi.
pam How about a little visit?
jim Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
creed Hey, Angela's back with her baby.
pam Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
andy Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
creed Let me have a turn.
pam No, it's the pacifier's turn.
creed all right.
jim Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
pam Yes! cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
phyllis Cookies?
pam No, but that would've been a really good idea.
jim That was a great idea.
pam No, she brought you drawings.
jim Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
andy Oh!
jim Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
phyllis Oh.
andy Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
cece No.
pam She says "no" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is "No. " Cece, do you want some broccoli?
cece Yes.
pam No. It's crazy.
ryan Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
andy There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
kelly Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
cece No.
kelly So then this means nothing to you.
andy Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
jim You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
cece Mama!
pam Shh.
jim I don't know what else we can do here.
cece Mama, mama, mama.
jim It's okay.
pam Oh, it's okay, sweetie.
jim all right, all right. Okay.
pam It's okay, honey. It's okay, it's okay.
jim all right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
pam Shh.
cece Mama!
dwight Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
angela Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
dwight Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
angela That is completely untrue.
dwight Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
dwight You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
angela I did not. Uh-uh.
dwight -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you, " and you said, "I'd like to see you try, " and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
angela That didn't happen.
dwight And then I inserted my penis-
angela No! Stop it!
dwight Into your-
angela Dwight.
dwight v*g1n* and-
angela And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
dwight Admit that there is a chance.
angela I will not.
dwight Admit it. Admit it.
angela I will not, it's not- Senator
lipton all done?
dwight Yeah. Senator
lipton Mmm.
angela Yes, yes. He's sleeping.
dwight Before I go, may I?
angela Sure. Watch the head, watch the head.
dwight Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
nurse Who are you?
dwight I just might be his father.
nurse I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him.
jim I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
cece No!
jim Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
pam I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.
jim Cece!
pam Okay, we're going.
jim Okay, okay, we gotta go. all right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
pam Shh, shh, shh.
jim I know, I know.
pam You want to grab her?
jim I'm gonna grab her, okay.
pam Here we go, here we go.

stanley We'll see you tomorrow.
jim No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
phyllis No, just go home.
darryl It's all good, we got this.
darryl I have a kid. Last week, jim at home? That was no vacation.
pam Jim.
phyllis Just go.
andy Hey, we'll be just fine.
jim Thanks guys. all right, here we go. Let's go.
andy Oh, whew!
andy Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
dwight Oh, right. The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
gabe You had something important to tell me?
dwight Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
dwight Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
