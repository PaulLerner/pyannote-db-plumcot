pam W. B. jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.
jim So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
pam Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.
jim Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
pam Nature.
oscar Been here nine years. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to park half a mile away.
andy I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.
kevin I will quit. As God as my witness, I will quit if this is not fixed.
pam Some of us like the walk more than others.
kevin Hurts like hell.
pam Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.
michael Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
pam But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.
pam michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. I really want it.
michael Have you ever seen this woman?
pam Her?
michael Hmm.
pam The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?
michael Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
pam Or in a great chair.
michael Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
pam I definitely remember your dinner party.
michael I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
pam Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.
michael What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.
michael Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85.
creed Yo, is this his new chair?
pam No, he hasn't picked one yet.
creed Daat!
creed When pam gets Michael's old chair, I get Pam's old chair. Then I'll have two chairs. Only one to go.
michael I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.
andy I left my cell phone in my car.
phyllis Call us when you get there so we know you're OK.
michael Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?
kevin If I had someone to set you up with Michael, then I'd take her for myself.
michael I thought that you were engaged?
kevin Nope. Stacy broke up with me.
michael Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
kevin Not anymore.
michael Oh.
kevin It's a bitter situation.
michael Yeah. ugh. She's. you don't deserve her. Alright.
michael Oh hello oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm.
phyllis Michael?
michael What?
phyllis I have a friend who's single.
michael Oh.
phyllis Sandy. She's gorgeous and she's got a feisty personality, too.
michael Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
phyllis Umm, no, she's a professional softball player.
michael Oooo. Catcher or in field?
phyllis Umm I don't know Michael.
michael Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
phyllis What are you asking?
michael I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
phyllis No, alright no, she can't fit in a row boat.
michael Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
michael What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.
michael Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.
angela I don't think that this is---
michael Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn. I can't help elhh la la. " No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
dwight Write legibly people.
andy Because of the construction at W. B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.
michael Hmm.
andy It's like a ten minute walk.
kevin No, thirty.
michael Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so. Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. OK, yes that would be bad.
kevin Yes.
andy Yes.
michael That would be bad.
andy OK.
kevin Nice.
andy . So help us out.
michael Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
kevin Michael, please he--
michael What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
andy We won't let you down.
michael Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
stanley There's nobody I hate enough to write her name on this card.
phyllis Well, I'm setting michael up with my fat friend anyway, he can just deal with it.
pam Who are you putting down?
jim Oh, you don't know her.
pam Who is it?
jim Your mom.
pam Yeah, whatever. Give it to me. Give it to me.

michael Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready. Wendy's phone
operator It's ready now.
michael Well put it aside. Umm. yeah.
dwight OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
michael Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm. this one says chair model.
dwight I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
michael That sounds good. Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
dwight That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
dwight The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.

michael I don't know man. I was with jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just.
dwight You know what you need? Closure.
michael You're right. What do you mean though?
dwight There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
michael Hmm.
dwight Come on. I'll drive.
kevin We did it.
andy I did it.
kevin We got our spaces back.
oscar Wow.
pam Nice job.
jim Nice.
andy Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.
andy Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.
michael How did she die?
dwight I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
michael God.
dwight Yeah.
michael She was so innocent.
dwight She was stoned apparently.
michael You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
dwight You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
michael Oh, you move on.
dwight Yeah.
jim Where do you want to go for dinner?

pam I hate you.
jim What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
pam Oh, oh.
jim No, no, no.
pam How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?
michael Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids. drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off and die? Michael/
dwight OH! You believe in rock 'n roll. Can music save your mortal soul? And then can you have to dance real slow. Well, I know that you're in love with him. 'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym. 'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues.
michael Return.
dwight Rhythm and blues.
michael This'll be the day that I died.
