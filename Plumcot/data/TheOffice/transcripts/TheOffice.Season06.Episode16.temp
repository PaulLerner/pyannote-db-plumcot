employee Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here.
michael Okey doke. Hotel
employee Um, I don't seem to have it, sir.
michael What?
dwight I'm not seeing anything under "confirmation. "
michael No.
dwight Could it be under "affirmation?" Cause you have thousands of those.
michael No. We're trying to look it up right now.
dwight You did get the e-vite to my barbeque!
michael Um, come on.
dwight Michael. Hotel
employee Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months.
michael Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
dwight Wait, I got it! Confirmation
code XV2RDM! Hotel
employee . Oh, here it is. Yep.
michael Oh.
dwight Thank you. Hotel
employee Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?
michael That's it! Hotel
employee Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize. michael and
dwight Uh-huh, okay. Hotel
employee Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott?
michael Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please. Hotel
employee There is a cancellation fee for this, sir.
michael Okay, put it on my card.
michael Today, jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?
michael Why hello!
gabe This is michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
michael Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
jo Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the "Mrs. " just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place.
andy These sure are pretty dogs.
jo They love a good crotch.
andy They sure do.
jo You should take that as a compliment!
andy Oh, I do!
jo Hello.
dwight Hello.
jo Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?
dwight I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
jo I like that.
gabe This is Accounting.
kevin Hi!
jo Good-looking group.
gabe Over here is meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
jo Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?
gabe That is jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
jo I thought this guy was the manager?
gabe Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
jo Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!
andy Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
angela No, no!
kevin What, no candy?
andy Valentine's Day, right around the corner. erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem "too eager, " so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
andy
 Look alive.
meredith Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
meredith Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
michael Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
jim Whoa, whoa.
michael Whoa, whoa!
jim I'll take over. Um, what we're doing
here michael handles more of the "big-picture" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together.
jo Yeah. I think I understand.
jim Alright.
jo Each of you is doing half a job.
jim No.
michael And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
jo This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim?
jim I don't think so.
jo Michael?
michael Forget the question.
jo I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.
michael I humbly accept the management position.
jim I. Why would you just say something like that?
michael Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of
folk those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.
jim Do you even know what that means?
michael Yes.
jo Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go.
jim Um.
jo You can go on. Shoo!
jo I'm Jolene Bennett, jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you.
andy Whoa-oh, traffic jam!
erin Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
andy Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
erin Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
andy There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.
erin Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
andy Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.
erin You named them?
andy Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
erin Uh, yeah I do remember. Aw, they love each other.
andy Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
erin Wow, it smells really good too.
andy Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
erin Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
andy It's got pheromones in it.
jo Hey!
kevin Hi.
jo Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion!
kevin Jo, there's books in my chair.
jo That's right, darlin', now you're the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What's that? Some company I've never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars?
michael No, we know. Texas!
jo Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm's reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we're gonna take that arm, and we're gonna start selling printers.
michael I could manage my way around that.
jo They're the easiest-to-use printers on the market.
michael I will try to manage my excitement!
michael I have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a pen1s. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a pen1s. And vise-versa.
jo I think that's it. So we're all good! Thanks ya'll.
dwight I, uh.
kelly Oh my God.
kelly I guess andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
pam So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
jim This is way more than I make now.
jim I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
jim Hey, you got a second?
michael Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
jim Actually, yeah.
michael What?
jim Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
michael What? Really?
jim Yeah!
michael Wow!
michael La la la, hello Oscar!
oscar Michael. Reading.
michael What are you reading?
oscar The Atlantic.
michael Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
oscar I should step into sales myself.
michael Why, is there an untapped gay market?
oscar Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
michael . Where did you get that information.
oscar Manual.
michael Manuel who?
michael Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
michael Son of a bitch. Pardon me.
jo Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!
michael Okay.
jo Now jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.
michael Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
jo Really?
jim Really.
michael Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.
jo Well, I think you're both being a little too modest.
jim No, I really, really think michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
michael No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
jim Why would you do that?
michael I'm turning myself in right now!
jo You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I'm gonna defer to your judgment.
michael Thank you.
jo I think you will become the salesman, and congratulations! You're gonna be the new manager of this branch!
michael Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss. . push;
pam Oh, michael marked his heights. He's grown!
jim Mm!
dwight Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. 89. 88.
dwight You're twenty minutes late!
ryan Um, I was at another dumpster!
dwight Just admit you lost track of time.
dwight ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
ryan Did you see Saw?
dwight Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
ryan No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
dwight Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
ryan Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
dwight I like where you're going with this. Continue.
ryan Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
dwight I have an old barn!
ryan Yes!
dwight It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
ryan We do what they did in Saw! . I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask.
dwight Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
ryan Well suggest something else then! Don't just.
dwight He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
ryan Don't just criticize my idea!
dwight Think!
ryan You think of something then!
erin Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
michael How is that possible?
erin Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
michael No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
erin You know, I actually think I should get back to work. jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
michael Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? michael Scott, head of sales.
jim You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
dwight The new IT guy. Nick.
ryan Nick.
dwight I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
ryan Like Frodo!
dwight Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
ryan Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
dwight Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
dwight I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
erin Who's hungry?
jim What is that?
erin It's ants on a log. michael would always have me bring them in at 2
 30 and say "Who's hungry?"
jim Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
erin Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
jim Why would I wanna do that?
erin It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
jim For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here.
erin Oh sure.
jim Yeah. Thank you.
erin Well.
michael It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves. " I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!
kevin Nice!
dwight You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
michael Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
dwight It's not really 1992 anymore.
michael Well, okay.
kelly You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
erin Geez louise.
kelly I know, obsessed with me much?
erin Well, everyone got one.
kelly What did yours say?
erin Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
erin It's no wonder that andy gave kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that andy was only going after one girl, cause andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
dwight Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
nick Uh, yep.
dwight I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
nick No, I actually don't.
dwight Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
nick I think that you should call the cops.
dwight No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to jim Halpert's computer.
nick I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry, I just can't give out his password like that.
ryan Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
nick Are you. you threatening me?
ryan Threatening you? No.
michael What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
pam Michael, stop.
michael No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up. Is it the dogs?
pam Michael.
michael You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
dwight Michael, it's Phyllis.
michael No, this is geological.
phyllis I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
michael Are you kidding me?
phyllis No.
michael And you guys are okay with this?
dwight She sent an email, so.
phyllis I did.
andy It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
michael Oh my God.
kelly Oh! You scared me!
andy I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.
kelly I didn't see you. And you were there all along. Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
andy Cool, thanks.
kelly Bye, Andy.
andy . That was weird.
meredith No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
andy I don't even know what that card said.
meredith Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right. now.
michael Hey.
jim Hey.
michael You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
jim Well, the grass is always greener.
michael Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
jim Well, it's what you wanted.
michael I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
jim For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
michael We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out. Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
jim Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
michael Lethal Weapon?
jim That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
jo You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?
michael What? What I'm saying.
jim Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
michael And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? See? They love me.
jo Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.
jim Alright.
michael Alright!
jo Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em.
andy Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following
message "Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way. "
phyllis You don't even like us as friends?
andy Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.
oscar What are we, five?
andy "Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog. "
kelly Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
andy It's n-- that wasn't. I like someone else.
kelly Who?
andy It's not. Whether or not, you.
kelly Who, what?
erin Yeah, I guess andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
michael Oh, it smells good in here.
erin Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
michael Erin, what about my keyboard? Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
erin Oh!
pam He looks happy.
jim Yep.
dwight Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he what? Michael!
dwight I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
ryan jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
dwight Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
ryan I would love to. Why not?
dwight Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
ryan Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
dwight It is not "farm boy swill, " I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
ryan I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
