andy How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
charles Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? Thank you. So, umm.
jim Would you please stop that?
dwight What?
jim You're breathing very heavily.
dwight This is how I breathe.
jim No it's not.
dwight If you want to tell me -
charles Okay, jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
jim Oh no. I was just -
charles No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear "yes".
jim . Yes.
charles Good. As I was saying.

michael So how you feeling about the new company?
pam I feel good. Wow.
michael You excited? About the new company?
pam Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
michael After breakfast.
pam We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. Michael. Stop for a second.
michael No, I'm whipping them.
pam No, I know you are.
michael Just let go.
pam Just let me have. Oh.
michael Let go, please. Just gimmee -
pam Fine! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
michael I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
phyllis I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
stanley I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
creed Oh, he does. He does.
michael I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
pam You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
michael I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
pam I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
micheal Whatever calms you down.
pam Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
michael Don't patronize me, Pam.
pam I think you should get dressed.
michael I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
pam Michael, that seems impossible.
michael It's totally impossible!
pam We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
michael Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
pam Great.
michael Okay, Ryan.
pam No. What? Why?
michael He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
pam No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
michael Umm. Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.

michael He worked at that telemarketing place.
pam We'll find him.
michael Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
pam Really?
michael Yeah.
pam We have an investor already?
michael Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
pam Michael, that's fantastic.
michael Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. Umm.
pam Hey! We need to get you dressed!
pam I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. Hey! You look great! Let's go!
michael Alright.
andy 
charles You a soccer fan?
andy Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
charles Well, that makes two of us.
andy No way!
charles Yeah.
andy I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? charles Miner.
charles I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
andy Ahhh. You b*st*rd! That shoulda been me!
charles Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
andy Cool!
jim I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
pam Next on the list - open the mail.
michael Oh. Wow. "michael Scott Paper Company. " Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence. "
pam No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add "find office".
michael How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
pam Next on the list -- song parodies.
michael Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart. "
pam Great. Let's sing it in the car.
michael No! No No. No. "My Stumps. " Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs.
pam Yeah.
michael We can do this.
pam We can do this.
andy Whoa! And he just goes, "Boom". Goal!
charles Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
andy You know your soccer, man.
charles I know. Yes I do.
stanley I prefer Maradona. Uhhh. Diego Maradona.
charles Oh yeah?
stanley From Argentina.
charles I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
andy I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but.
charles What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
jim Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
charles Well, it's not for everybody I suppose.
jim It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
charles Yeah?
jim You bet.
dwight Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
jim Well I do.
dwight Wow.
jim I play.
dwight You can be so modest sometimes.
jim Well, maybe you should get back to work.
dwight Maybe you and charles should kick the soccer ball around.
jim Maybe we will someday.
dwight Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
charles That's a great idea, Dwight.
dwight Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
jim Yeah.
dwight I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
charles What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
dwight Jim, what do you say?
angela Sounds fun.
andy I'm in it to win.
dwight Game on!
charles Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.

michael Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. Ah, okay.
vikram He seems really confident.
pam He can be.
vikram Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.
pam Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
michael Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. It's Michael.
ryan I'm swamped, Michael. Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
michael Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
vikram He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do.
pam Yes. Yes, it's possible.
michael Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
pam Michael! What's going on?
michael I'm.
pam Hey, Ryan.
ryan Hey, you.
michael Excuse me. Yes?

michael Yes, it is.
pam No.
michael Yes.
pam It's not.
michael It is.
pam When did you add this to the list?

ryan Sixty thousand dollars a year.
pam You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
ryan What do you make, secretary?
supervisor Back to work, shoe bitch!
ryan I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so.
michael Would you like to come to work for the michael Scott Paper Company?

jim Aw, it's gonna be the worst.
ryan Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
michael Oh yeah.
pam Sure.
ryan It was indescribable.
michael Sounds awesome.
pam Beat.
vikram What sort of investing club is this?
michal Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!
pam Nana?
nana Michael!
michael People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
michael Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - pam Beesly. Pretty pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
nana So let's hear it.
michael Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
nana How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
michael By wanting it more. By working hard-
nana What's your mission statement?
michael Mmmm-My mission is stated as
follows I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the michael Scott guarantee.
charles C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
dwight Wing.
kevin Wag.
charles Jim. What do you play?
jim Left.
charles Forward or half?
jim Forward, definitely.
chares Okay, striker, huh?
jim Striker!
charles Let's see what you got in those legs!
jim Alright! Let's do it.
charles Alright. No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
jim Kickoff. My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. Alright!
michael And I offer same day, free delivery.
nana Michael, I don't know about this.
michael Nana. I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
nana I'm not so sure.
michael Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other.
nana See, this is what concerns me. Old
woman We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.
michael Well. this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
nana This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!
michael Okay.
nana I love you, Michael. I do.
michael Okay.
nana But no. I mean it. No.
vikram I thought nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?
pam It means grandmother.
vikram Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I'm sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?
vikram You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same-
andy Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim.
charles Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
oscar Phyllis, Phyllis.
charles Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
phyllis No, I swallowed a crown.
charles Why'd you duck, Jim?
jim What?
dwight Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
jim Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
charles Does that make you feel better? Huh?
jim I'm sorry, Phyllis.
charles Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.
ryan Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
michael Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
pam I can't do this.
michael What's that?
pam I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
michael Blech.
pam I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
michael Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
pam We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
michael Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. Okay.
pam How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
michael I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
pam Yeah.
michael So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or. that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?
michael You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have. lurkin' around. some awesome, free, keep it off the books. Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
michael I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
michael Okay.
pam I could work here. I could see this.
michael It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
pam Are you good?
michael Yeah, I'm good. You good?
pam I'm good.
michael You know what they say, keep your friends close.
charles Michael, you're back.
michael Yes, I am, Charles.
charles Mmmhmm.
michael Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
