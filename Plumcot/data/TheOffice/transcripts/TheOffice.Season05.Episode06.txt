michael_scott Hey, sport.
dwight_schrute I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?
michael_scott Ow! God!
dwight_schrute Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
darryl_philbin I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
andy_bernard Big idea double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
michael_scott No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
jim_halpert Yeah, we'd never do that.
michael_scott Yeah, so there you go.
kelly_kapoor Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
michael_scott Oh, wow, so quickly.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
kevin_malone Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
michael_scott Nope. Nope. Not yet.
jim_halpert You wouldn't tell your mom?
kevin_malone You love your mom.
kelly_kapoor Call your mom, Michael.
michael_scott I'll call her later.
all@ Call her! Call her!
michael_scott I don't want to do that. All right. She is going to freak out!
andy_bernard Speakerphone!
michael_scott That's -- thanks.
michaels_mom Hello?
michael_scott Mom, I'm getting married.
michaels_mom No, you're not.
michael_scott Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
michaels_mom Well, are you getting married?
michael_scott No.
michaels_mom Are you--
michael_scott I'm not, I'm not getting married. So... Psych.
kelly_kapoor So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
michael_scott And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
kelly_kapoor Yeah, uh, this is all of them Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, Andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there?
michael_scott I'll take care of that for you. Thanks.
michael_scott Kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. "Schindler's List" parody. ... That's not appropriate, no.
jim_halpert Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
pam_beesly Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
jim_halpert Aww.
pam_beesly It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
jim_halpert Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
pam_beesly We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
alex Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?
jim_halpert and Pam Sprinkle of cinnamon.
pam_beesly I should go.
michael_scott Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
dwight_schrute Bring it on.
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute Sorry.
michael_scott Wow.
dwight_schrute What does it say?
michael_scott Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
dwight_schrute That's impossible.
michael_scott A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
dwight_schrute I sell more paper than anyone.
michael_scott No, no, no, no, no.
dwight_schrute Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
michael_scott Do I look like I am joking?
dwight_schrute No, but that's sometimes part of it.
michael_scott If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
dwight_schrute Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
michael_scott You're not.
andy_bernard Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
jim_halpert Nope.
andy_bernard I got mine. They were really good.
pam_beesly I miss him.
jim_halpert You must be really proud.
andy_bernard Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug.
jim_halpert Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
andy_bernard Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
jim_halpert OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use uh, oh -- Snoopy.
pam_beesly Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.
andy_bernard It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
jim_halpert How can you even be sure?
andy_bernard It has my face on it.
jim_halpert Make the face. Yeah, I don't see it.
andy_bernard Dude, that is my face!
pam_beesly What was that?
jim_halpert Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
pam_beesly Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
jim_halpert It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
dwight_schrute What are you mumbling about?
jim_halpert How was your meeting with Michael?
dwight_schrute None of your business.
jim_halpert Was it your scores?
dwight_schrute Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute I'm being sabotaged.
jim_halpert Of course.
dwight_schrute And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
jim_halpert Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
dwight_schrute You're an idiot.
jim_halpert There's the charm.
michael_scott Jimbo, let's do this thang.
jim_halpert That is me. Wish me luck.
dwight_schrute No way.
pam_beesly Good luck.
jim_halpert Thanks.
dwight_schrute I didn't say anything
pam_beesly I love you.
jim_halpert I love you, too.
dwight_schrute What do you think I am saying to you?!
jim_halpert I'm not talking to you.
dwight_schrute I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
andy_bernard Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
andy_bernard I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. I got him!
andy_bernard Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
michael_scott Oh, come on.
jim_halpert What?
michael_scott You too?
jim_halpert Did my scores drop a little?
michael_scott Jim, they are a poopy.
pam_beesly Jim? Jim?
jim_halpert Are we even sure that's my file?
michael_scott No. Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
jim_halpert Well, there's got to be an explanation.
michael_scott I agree.
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott So let's see what we can find out from reading. Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
jim_halpert I think you mean smug
michael_scott Arrogance.
jim_halpert Michael, I'm just trying to --
michael_scott And there's our smudgeness.
jim_halpert I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. Pam doesn't know about the house, so it's... a fun surprise. Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
pam_beesly Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
jim_halpert A little bit. ... Worth it.
michael_scott Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
jim_halpert Microgement.
michael_scott Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
dwight_schrute All right, fine. Brrring.
jim_halpert Hello?
dwight_schrute Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
jim_halpert Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
dwight_schrute Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
jim_halpert Wow, this is my lucky day.
michael_scott Ask him his name.
dwight_schrute What is your name, sir?
jim_halpert I am Bill Buttlicker.
dwight_schrute Really, that's your real name?
jim_halpert How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
michael_scott Be respectful, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Yes, Michael.
jim_halpert Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
dwight_schrute What? No, but I --
jim_halpert Hello? No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK.
michael_scott It's up to you to change his mind.
jim_halpert Sorry. That was a family emergency.
dwight_schrute Oh, no. What's wrong?
jim_halpert You know what? That's private.
michael_scott Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
dwight_schrute Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
jim_halpert Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
michael_scott He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
dwight_schrute OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
jim_halpert You're gonna have to talk louder.
dwight_schrute OK, our prices have never been lower.
jim_halpert Son, you have to talk louder.
dwight_schrute ...never been lower!
jim_halpert Louder, son!
dwight_schrute Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
michael_scott Stop it! Stop it!
dwight_schrute He --
michael_scott That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
jim_halpert Now, you listen to me, sir.
michael_scott Here we go.
jim_halpert The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
michael_scott Give me the phone.
dwight_schrute Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
jim_halpert I'm irate right now.
michael_scott Give me the phone.
dwight_schrute Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
michael_scott Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
dwight_schrute I have to put you on with my boss.
jim_halpert Well, I should hope so. Who is this?
michael_scott Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
jim_halpert Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
michael_scott Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
jim_halpert Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott See how it's done? Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. See what I did?
dwight_schrute You are the master.
jim_halpert There is one condition, Michael.
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
dwight_schrute Don't do it, Michael.
michael_scott ... It's a million-dollar sale.
andy_bernard So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
angela_martin I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
andy_bernard Hobos live in trains.
angela_martin Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
andy_bernard Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
angela_martin OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
andy_bernard Done and done-er.
angela_martin There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
andy_bernard Do you have a specific place in mind?
angela_martin No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
andy_bernard On it!
jim_halpert Dwight. Dwight.
dwight_schrute Get in!
jim_halpert Are you serious?
dwight_schrute Get in!
jim_halpert OK, what are you --
dwight_schrute Shh. They might be listening to us.
jim_halpert What's that?
dwight_schrute They might be listening to us
jim_halpert Who's they?
dwight_schrute Customer service might be monitoring this conversation.
jim_halpert In this car?
dwight_schrute You never know. Better safe than sorry.
jim_halpert What are you thinking?
dwight_schrute Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
jim_halpert The mob, maybe NASA.
dwight_schrute Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
jim_halpert Is there some evidence?
pam_beesly Ooh, cute shoes online.
jim_halpert How many shoes do you need?
dwight_schrute I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
jim_halpert I'm not talking to you.
dwight_schrute Who are you talking to?
jim_halpert Pam.
dwight_schrute She's not here, Jim.
jim_halpert No, she's not.
pam_beesly Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
andy_bernard Yes!
andy_bernard I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's Dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
dwights_ignored_customer So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um --
dwight_schrute Wait, shut up.
dwights_ignored_customer I'm sorry?
dwight_schrute Shh. Do you hear that?
dwights_ignored_customer Hear what?
dwight_schrute Breathing. Is that you?
dwights_ignored_customer Well, I am breathing, yes.
dwight_schrute Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on.
dwights_ignored_customer I need paper.
dwight_schrute Ha!
kelly_kapoor Oh, my God. You scared me.
dwight_schrute Hear anything interesting?
kelly_kapoor What are you talking about?
dwight_schrute I think you know.
kelly_kapoor You always say that, and I almost never know.
dwight_schrute What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
kelly_kapoor Are you accusing me of something?
dwight_schrute Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
jim_halpert OK.
dwight_schrute Ah!
jim_halpert Easy.
dwight_schrute OK.
jim_halpert Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
kelly_kapoor You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
dwight_schrute The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
kelly_kapoor Dwight, get out of my nook!
pam_beesly That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
jim_halpert Good one.
jim_halpert Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, he's weird.
jim_halpert Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
kelly_kapoor OK.
jim_halpert Hey, how are you and Darryl?
kelly_kapoor Um, we're cool. Bye.
jim_halpert Bye.
pam_beesly That was weird.
jim_halpert What was?
pam_beesly Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
jim_halpert No, actually.
pam_beesly Did you do something to her?
jim_halpert I don't think so.
pam_beesly Well, something's off.
jim_halpert Hey, how's things?
ryan_howard All right.
jim_halpert Yeah?
ryan_howard Living in the moment.
jim_halpert Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
ryan_howard I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. Can I tell you what else I learned?
jim_halpert Wait, that's pretty weird.
ryan_howard What?
jim_halpert Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
ryan_howard Oh, yeah, Kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
jim_halpert No. What party?
ryan_howard Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
jim_halpert I wasn't. But thank you. Do you know anything about this party?
pam_beesly Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
jim_halpert Well, I can't be the only one who didn't --
jim_halpert
jim_halpert Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert Is that it?
dwight_schrute No. Why? No.
jim_halpert OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
dwight_schrute Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
jim_halpert Probably just Kelly.
dwight_schrute Obviously. I knew it.
jim_halpert That's what I'm saying.
dwight_schrute Yeah. What?
jim_halpert You were right.
dwight_schrute I was -- I was right.
jim_halpert You were right.
dwight_schrute I was right.
jim_halpert You knew it.
dwight_schrute I knew it.
jim_halpert You knew it the whole time, buddy.
dwight_schrute I knew it the whole time, buddy!
jim_halpert Wow.
dwight_schrute Yeah! Woo-hoo!
pam_beesly Right Dwight is loud.
dwight_schrute I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! Boom! Kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
jim_halpert No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
kelly_kapoor What's going on?
michael_scott Why don't you tell us?
kelly_kapoor Nothing's going on.
dwight_schrute Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
michael_scott Dwight. I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
kelly_kapoor What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
dwight_schrute Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
jim_halpert We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
michael_scott What's going on?
kelly_kapoor I love your tie, Michael.
michael_scott Kelly.
kelly_kapoor I was raped.
michael_scott You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
kelly_kapoor OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
dwight_schrute We have our confession. I'm calling security.
michael_scott Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
kelly_kapoor See? I wasn't lying.
michael_scott You were lying.
kelly_kapoor I was lying.
michael_scott Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
dwight_schrute I want to be here when you fire her ass.
michael_scott I will call you when it is time.
michael_scott I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
kelly_kapoor No problem.
michael_scott I think you should do that.
alex Pam Beesley?
pam_beesly Hey, what are you doing here?
jim_halpert Who's that?
pam_beesly It's Alex.
alex It's Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go.
jim_halpert Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
pam_beesly Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
alex Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?
pam_beesly OK.
jim_halpert That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
alex Um.
pam_beesly What's up?
alex I'm gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton.
pam_beesly Wow.
jim_halpert I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
alex Why did you come to New York in the first place?
pam_beesly Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
alex Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it.
pam_beesly Jim's in Scranton.
alex I know. But all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway ... I will see you tomorrow.
pam_beesly I'll see you tomorrow.
alex OK.
dwight_schrute Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? May I?
jim_halpert Don't.
dwight_schrute Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
andy_bernard We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
dwight_schrute Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials?
andy_bernard Oh. Hmm.
dwight_schrute While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
andy_bernard That's very generous.
dwight_schrute While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
andy_bernard Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal!
dwight_schrute OK.
andy_bernard Um, what are we talking price wise?
dwight_schrute You already said deal.
angela_martin Pay him whatever he wants.
andy_bernard Can't argue with that. Dwight ... You are going to make us so happy.
