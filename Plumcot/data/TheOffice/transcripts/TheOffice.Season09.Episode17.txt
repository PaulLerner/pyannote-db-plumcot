dwight_schrute Hold it!
creed_bratton New glasses.
erin_hannon Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
dwight_schrute I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
pam_beesly Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
dwight_schrute I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
dwight_schrute My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
jim_halpert My condolences.
dwight_schrute Keep them.
jim_halpert OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
dwight_schrute In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
erin_hannon What color is it?
phyllis_vance It looks pretty black.
kevin_malone Yep. Acidic, all right.
oscar_martinez Oh, thank god.
dwight_schrute Excuse me?
oscar_martinez I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
dwight_schrute OK. That's not...
oscar_martinez I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
jim_halpert I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
dwight_schrute I really hope so.
jim_halpert OK. This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
dwight_schrute I miss her so much.
jim_halpert OK.
dwight_schrute You know?
mose Zeke's here.
dwight_schrute Zeke.
zeke Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'.
mose 'Hi' to Mom.
dwight_schrute Are you going?
mose Will there be ghosts there?
dwight_schrute Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
zeke You get in the sidecar.
dwight_schrute Get...
dwight_schrute What are you doing here?
oscar_martinez You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
dwight_schrute Oh, yeah.
oscar_martinez Who is that?
dwight_schrute Jeb, my brother.
oscar_martinez You have a brother?
dwight_schrute Uh-huh.
jebs_wife I didn't really see a better parking spot. Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental. You wanna go in?
erin_hannon Oh, gosh.
todd_packer Packer Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
clark Who's this guy?
pam_beesly ... bad.
todd_packer Packer Hi, all.
phyllis_vance Why are you here, Todd?
todd_packer Packer OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
kevin_malone Packer, we accept.
todd_packer Packer Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff. OK. Uh, where to begin. Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, this kid in a few years.
pam_beesly Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
todd_packer Packer Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
pam_beesly I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
todd_packer Packer Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? There you go.
pam_beesly Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
German#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode17 Minister We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil.
jebs_wife Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.
dwight_schrute Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
jebs_wife Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all.
dwight_schrute Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
jebs_wife It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.
dwight_schrute Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
jebs_wife Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any.
German#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode17 Minister Would the family care to say something?
dwight_schrute You had black hair and then gray hair.
zeke You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4", at the end you were 5'1".
oscar_martinez They're a descriptive people.
frannie I see you started without me.
dwight_schrute You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
frannie Well, I told you...
jebs_wife Hi, Fannie.
frannie Hey.
oscar_martinez Who is that?
zeke Dwight's sister.
oscar_martinez Dwight has a sister?
zeke Yeah.
oscar_martinez She's beautiful.
zeke Blugh.
dwight_schrute Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. What is this? Oh, god. Henry.
heinrich Dwight.
dwight_schrute I see Esther's back in town.
esther Hi Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
esther This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.
dwight_schrute Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
frannie We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here.
dwight_schrute OK.
heinrich Anyone mention her height?
zeke Yep.
heinrich Land size? Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. OK.
dwight_schrute So, let's get it going.
German#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode17 Minister Would you want to do the honors?
frannie Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this.
dwight_schrute We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
oscar_martinez That's it for me.
pam_beesly I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
phyllis_vance I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
pam_beesly We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
creed_bratton $3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
creed_bratton I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
clark Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
todd_packer Packer Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
clark You didn't actually say that.
todd_packer Packer No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. Hey. I have a crazy feeling that you are really gonna like this.
stanley_hudson Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. And you did fire him.
nellie_bertram I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
pam_beesly Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
angela_martin Do they even have a bakery anymore?
kevin_malone They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
pam_beesly So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
andy_bernard Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
phyllis_vance So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
meredith_palmer OK.
phyllis_vance OK. Packer can go to hell.
aunt_shirley Shirley Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
aunt_shirley Shirley Jeb. A street pusher.
jebs_wife After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out "worm" means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management.
dwight_schrute I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
aunt_shirley Shirley We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So, here are my terms. Dwight, Fannie, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So, there, you have it.
frannie Is she crazy? Dwight?
jebs_wife Buddy? Buddy?
frannie No, no, no.
jebs_wife Snap out of it. Dwight?
dwight_schrute Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
frannie No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy?
dwight_schrute Of course you are.
frannie Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication.
dwight_schrute Oh my god.
frannie That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don't know. The men are just... it's almost like there's a... a willing ignorance.
frannie Yes. I, thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And, I was recently published. Which is just... maybe I have. Yep. I do. Here it is from the um, Hartford Women's Lit Quarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fannie Schrute.
jebs_wife Totally. Yep. The people here are like Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart?
dwight_schrute You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
jebs_wife Couple of nights couldn't hurt.
frannie Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt.
dwight_schrute You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
zeke Absolutely.
zeke Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one. And, Mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian.
frannie That doesn't work on me.
dwight_schrute OK.
frannie By the way, that's not...
dwight_schrute
frannie Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui.
dwight_schrute Oui.
frannie Oh my goodness.
dwight_schrute People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
frannie So, I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then, if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks.
todd_packer Packer Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you.
meredith_palmer I'm not sorry about it.
todd_packer Packer I am. It was my rock bottom.
angela_martin Kevin, you can do this.
kevin_malone You don't know that.
pam_beesly Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
angela_martin Uh-huh.
kevin_malone James Bond was a spy.
pam_beesly Yes. He was a good spy.
kevin_malone Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
todd_packer Packer Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care.
todd_packer Packer I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.
pam_beesly Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. Hey!
angela_martin What, Pam?
pam_beesly Wait!
angela_martin He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
pam_beesly No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
andy_bernard Oh my god. I forgive him so much. Whoa, is he choking?
angela_martin Kevin?
kevin_malone Oh, that was fantastic.
cameron Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?
dwight_schrute Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
cameron I was just asking you something I didn't know.
dwight_schrute Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
cameron Are we gonna eat these today?
dwight_schrute If you want.
cameron Is that a guillotine?
dwight_schrute This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
cameron That's a cow?
dwight_schrute Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
cameron What are you doing now?
dwight_schrute Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
cameron I don't know.
dwight_schrute Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
cameron I don't know any of that.
dwight_schrute OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
cameron I never met him.
pam_beesly Good morning, Erin.
erin_hannon Hey.
pam_beesly Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
phyllis_vance I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
pam_beesly Phyllis!
clark Packer laced the cupcakes.
pam_beesly No!
meredith_palmer Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
angela_martin Some of us got both.
pam_beesly Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
phyllis_vance Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
nellie_bertram Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
stanley_hudson Me too.
clark I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
phyllis_vance What did you do, Andy?
andy_bernard Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. Na, nothing really. Kevin?
kevin_malone Why would you ask me?
andy_bernard I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. Pretty normal night.
kevin_malone My night was just like that. Meaning normal.
andy_bernard Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all.
kevin_malone Nope. I did not see you either.
pam_beesly Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
kevin_malone Ah.
pam_beesly But, Kevin that's...
kevin_malone Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
angela_martin No.
todd_packer Packer So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends.
darryl_philbin That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
jim_halpert Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
todd_packer Packer It's OK. I'm over it.
jebs_wife Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it.
frannie Not it.
dwight_schrute It. That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
frannie All right.
