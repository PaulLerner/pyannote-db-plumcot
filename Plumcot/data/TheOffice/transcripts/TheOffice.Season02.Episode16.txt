pam_beesly I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
pam_beesly Phyllis.
flower_delivery_man_1 man Would you sign here?
pam_beesly Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
meredith_palmer "Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration."
phyllis_vance Isn't he sweet?
meredith_palmer Yeah. Wow.
michael_scott Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
dwight_schrute And you want me to come with you.
michael_scott Nope. The opposite of that.
dwight_schrute I will stay here and run things on this end.
michael_scott Ok, good.
dwight_schrute Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
michael_scott I probably will, why do you ask?
dwight_schrute Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute Screwed.
michael_scott What is your problem?
michael_scott This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
michael_scott Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
pam_beesly That's OK.
michael_scott Alright.
oscar_martinez The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
michael_scott Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
michael_scott Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
jim_halpert So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
dwight_schrute What's this? What is this?
jim_halpert I dunno, it's on your desk.
dwight_schrute Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
jim_halpert It was there when I sat down.
dwight_schrute Happy Valentine's Day. It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! Ahh!
michael_scott The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice.
jim_halpert Hey Kelly. What's up?
kelly_kapoor Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
jim_halpert OH, that's great. I'm really happy for
kelly_kapoor And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like "Ryan, what's taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
jim_halpert Wow.
kelly_kapoor So I said, "Ryan, what took you so long?" And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
jim_halpert Wow.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
jim_halpert No, don't be.
kelly_kapoor Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
jim_halpert I bet.
kelly_kapoor So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
jim_halpert Alright.
ryan_howard I hooked up with her on February 13th.
michael_scott Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
kevin_malone Woah.
pam_beesly Guess what?
phyllis_vance Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
pam_beesly That's great.
michael_scott Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
michael_scott This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey . That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
dwight_schrute Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
angela_martin Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
dwight_schrute Oh I did. I did.
angela_martin I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
dwight_schrute Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
angela_martin Really? Well, I hope I do.
michael_scott I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
jim_halpert Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
kevin_malone Woah, woah
flower_delivery_man_1 man Phyllis Lapin.
pam_beesly OH, Holy God!
flower_delivery_man_1 man It's from Bob.
kevin_malone Man, that thing's bigger than I am.
flower_delivery_man_1 man No, it's not.
kevin_malone Oh zip it.
michael_scott There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
craig Hey.
josh_porter Michael Scott.
michael_scott Josh Porter, high five. Bam.
josh_porter You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
michael_scott Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.
craig What's up buddy?
michael_scott You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
craig Guilty, yeah.
michael_scott So what's going on? What I miss?
josh_porter Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
michael_scott Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...
dwight_schrute Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
pam_beesly You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
dwight_schrute No, Pam, Just. Just,
pam_beesly You need to get something for your girlfriend.
dwight_schrute Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
pam_beesly Tightly wound?
dwight_schrute Exactly.
pam_beesly Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
dwight_schrute You mean, like a ham?
pam_beesly No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
dwight_schrute Ok, I get it.
pam_beesly That you remember her.
dwight_schrute Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do.
josh_porter What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
craig Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said "You gotta fire four people," and I was just like, "What?" Ya know?
josh_porter Did you?
craig No, I just ignored her. She's the worse.
josh_porter She is our boss.
craig She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.
michael_scott Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
craig What? You like Jan? How can you like Jan?
michael_scott Maybe because she's my girlfriend. Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
josh_porter You hooked up with Jan?
michael_scott You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
josh_porter Yeah, let's change the subject.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah.
kelly_kapoor I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
jim_halpert Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need...
ryan_howard Soda.
kelly_kapoor Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
jim_halpert Oh, no, not while I'm here.
kelly_kapoor I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
ryan_howard I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
kelly_kapoor OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
ryan_howard Cool. Cool. OK.
jan_levinson Josh Porter, Stamford.
david_wallace David
josh_porter Nice to meet you.
jan_levinson And Michael Scott, Scranton.
david_wallace Nice to meet you.
michael_scott Ditto. How are you Jan?
jan_levinson Fine Michael. Thank you.
david_wallace OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
jan_levinson Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
josh_porter So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
david_wallace Thanks very much.
josh_porter Thank you.
david_wallace OK, Michael.
michael_scott What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.
michael_scott Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
michael_scott Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.
michael_scott And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home.
michael_scott Questions?
david_wallace Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
michael_scott Yes, thank you.
david_wallace But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
michael_scott Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm...
flower_delivery_man_1 man Can you sign?
pam_beesly Yeah.
pam_beesly Oscar.
angela_martin Nothing for me?
pam_beesly Join the club.
kevin_malone Whose it from?
oscar_martinez My mom.
kelly_kapoor It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
jim_halpert You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
jim_halpert Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
kelly_kapoor Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan?
dan_gore And that about does it, thank you.
jan_levinson OK. Craig,
craig Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.
jan_levinson Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
craig I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal.
david_wallace So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
craig That is correct, yes.
jan_levinson Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
craig Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
jan_levinson Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
craig Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too.
michael_scott Oh, ok. Alright.
jan_levinson NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
michael_scott No you're not.
jan_levinson Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
michael_scott Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
jan_levinson Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
michael_scott Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
jan_levinson Surely, you cannot be serious?
michael_scott I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
dwight_schrute Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
roy_anderson Hey babe.
pam_beesly Hey.
roy_anderson You almost ready to go?
pam_beesly I guess, yeah.
roy_anderson What's wrong?
pam_beesly Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
roy_anderson What, you're mad at me?
pam_beesly I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day.
roy_anderson Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best s*x of you life.
david_wallace You understand this is a very serious situation.
michael_scott No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.
david_wallace You made a joke?
michael_scott I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.
david_wallace Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
michael_scott I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
jan_levinson Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
david_wallace Good.
pam_beesly Heading out?
jim_halpert Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
pam_beesly Bye.
phyllis_vance Goodnight Pam.
pam_beesly Night Phyllis.
jan_levinson Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
michael_scott Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
jan_levinson Oh, no, it's OK. So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
michael_scott Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.
jan_levinson Oh.
michael_scott Oy vey... schmear.
