toby This here is a radon test kit. Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And. please don't throw these out. This is a radon test kit. Please don't throw these out. See them all over the office.
michael toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. The second time. I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time. I did it out of spite.
michael Pfffffttt.
toby Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
michael You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
toby Please sit down.
michael You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
everyone YEAH!
michael Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot toby twice.
everyone No. No!
jim That's. not okay.
michael Okay, alright.
dwight You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
michael I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
dwight No, hmmm. that's still.
everyone Mm-mm.
michael Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
creed Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
oscar All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden.
ryan Is there a curtain rod in the room?
michael I don't know.
stanley How about make-believe land has anything you want?
jim Stanley, please, this is serious!
angela Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
michael Yes, we stab toby through the heart with an icicle.
dwight Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do
it You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
toby I don't wanna do this.
michael Toby, just do it! God!
dwight Toby, come on.
dwight Ready, one bullet. And boom!
everyone Yeah, that works. That works!
michael Good work.
pam What flavors did you get?
erin It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
pam Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
erin Do you want me to go back to the store?
pam No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
erin This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
pam Yeah, and when michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
erin After his last breakup, he ate 40, 000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what pam told me.
pam Yeah, or no. well. I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
erin That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
erin We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
pam And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
erin He's coming.
pam Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
toby Hey everyone.
pam No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
dwight Leave, get outta here.
pam Leave!
dwight Right now!
pam Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
michael Morning everyone.
everyone Hey! Hey, hey!
erin Hi Michael.
michael Hello!
dwight Michael, nice tie or something.
michael Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think.
kevin That's hilarious.
pam That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
michael Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
kevin Boi-oi-oi-ing
michael Okay. Well. that's random. I will dig into those later.
lawyer I don't follow this exactly. Uh, "The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have. " dwight and
angela Joint custody
lawyer Are we talking about your grandchildren?
angela No.
dwight No.
angela Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
dwight Alleged contract.
angela Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
dwight Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
dwight So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh. the beet juice cleanse?
angela I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
dwight How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
angela Dwight, look at my teeth.
dwight Eughh.
andy No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
pam Could he still be seeing her?
phyllis I don't think he'd do that.
jim So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that michael matured overnight?
andy Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
jim Exactly. It happened in Big.
michael No, I gotta go. Text me later.
jim I'm really too tired to do this.
pam Me too!
jim Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
pam Hey Michael.
michael Hey.
pam We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
jim We can order in from Hooters.
michael Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
pam We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
jim Billy Joel Rock Band.
michael That. exists?
pam Yes.
michael Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
pam michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
michael Okay, Pam. she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
phyllis Oh Michael.
michael Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
michael I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband. or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
meredith That is something I would never do.
michael Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
meredith Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
meredith I ask. everyone in the room, "Are you in a relationship?".
michael People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
kelly Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around michael anymore.
ryan Okay.
michael I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
andy How does he feel about it?
michael He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
jim Now you're just being hurtful.
michael I'm sorry, it. why is it okay for stanley to cheat or for phyllis to cheat.
phyllis Hey!
michael On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
andy Did Donna tell you that?
michael Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
andy So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
michael You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring michael Jackson. just sit there and think about michael jackson.
andy My name is andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
andy So. here's the thing about infidelity.
michael Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
andy How does that work?
michael Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
andy In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
michael I am Beyonce always.
andy Not this time.
michael Yes, I am.
andy This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
michael I would love that.
andy Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
michael I have work to do.
andy Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
michael Let's go. I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
andy Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
michael All right, Andy, please.
andy Baseball!
michael Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
andy Where?
michael Right there. The coach!
andy Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
michael Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
andy And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
michael All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
andy Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
gabe Guys?
jim Pam.
pam Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
gabe Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
pam You were supposed to be the Lookout.
jim Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
gabe I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
jim Sorry about that.
pam So embarrassing.
gabe Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
jim Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
pam We will be well-rested tomorrow.
gabe Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
jim Excellent. Go for it.
gabe I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
jim Right? So, uh, let's uh. . push;
lawyer Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.
angela Same page. Go to the next one.
dwight Same page. Just keep moving.
lawyer Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--
dwight Which we can't know.
lawyer This is essentially.
dwight Unless we're unplugged.
lawyer Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
dwight And wake up in the future.
lawyer Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
dwight What?
lawyer Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.
angela What?
lawyer So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30, 000.
dwight What?
dwight I don't have $30, 000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
andy Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
michael You have no idea what you're talking about.
andy I know it's like cricket.
michael You don't. No, no.
andy And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
michael You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna. " "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit. "
andy Seems pretty well liked by the team.
michael Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
andy You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
michael I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
dwight $30, 000? There's gotta be another way.
angela He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
dwight Look, I will not pay.
angela Well, I have an alternative.
dwight "Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"
lawyer Look, I don't think that's actually legal.
dwight Agreed.
dwight Five times for $30, 000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
dwight But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
angela Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
dwight Fine. Five times.
lawyer Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.
angela I want eye contact.
dwight No.
angela Yes.
dwight Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
angela I'm not some farm animal.
andy Great game, coach.
michael Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
andy You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
shane Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys.
andy Ha. The other guys can go die.
michael Okay.
andy Baseball! Go talk to him.
michael No. God. You go talk to him.
shane Let's go.
andy Shane. Great game man!
shane Do I know you?
andy No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
shane Are you somebody's. parents? Oh, are you guys. Kenny's dads?
andy Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball.
shane Okay.
andy But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
shane Okay. Let's go!
andy Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
shane Whoa!
andy I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
shane Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to. focus here on the game.
andy I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
shane Of course. Okay? I gotta. get back to this.
andy Of course.
shane All right.
andy But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
michael No, no, no.
andy Come on, get over here.
michael I'm good. Oh, my God.
andy Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
michael Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
shane It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going.
michael Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife. " And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
michael Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
erin Thanks, Michael.
michael Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
oscar Why would you throw something wet at me?
michael You love it. There ya go.
jim Now, were those for the team?
michael Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
jim Ah.
pam I don't think those were yours to take.
michael Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
andy I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
pam Did you talk to him?
michael I did.
pam You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
kevin Wow. That is crazy.
phyllis Was there a fistfight?
michael No. We just talked. He's very nice.
phyllis And it didn't change your mind.
michael It did not.
phyllis Michael, that's awful.
michael Isn't it?
phyllis Yes.
michael I'm awful, aren't I?
kevin Yeah. That's pretty bad.
michael I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
oscar How can you live with yourself?
michael I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
kevin That is a dangerous game, friendo.
kelly Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
ryan I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
kelly 'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
ryan All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, "I read a book about anthropology. "
kelly I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
ryan I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
kelly That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
michael I don't care. I have an appetite for life! Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
ryan Good for you, man. Good for you.
ryan He takes what he wants.
ryan You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
erin What about Kelly?
ryan You read my mind.
erin Is this a joke?
ryan Yep.
ryan It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
michael You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
dwight I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. Let's see what she gets. Aah!
creed Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
michael Yeah, I noticed that.
creed Are you gonna add any more?
michael Nope.
creed He don't give an "F" about nothin'!
michael I have got big balls.
pam I don't think I'm gonna make it.
jim What about an energy drink or something?
pam It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
jim Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
pam Well, it does and it doesn't.
darryl Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so. we have a place.
jim A place?
darryl A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
pam You sleep in the warehouse?
darryl Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
jim Okay.
darryl Pam.
pam Okay.
phyllis For your signature.
michael Okay. Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. Phyllis, look at-- okay, that's. All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
kevin Why not your condo?
michael Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
stanley Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
michael Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
andy Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
michael Nobody better try to stop me. Good.
dwight I could have stopped him.
dwight Are you warmed up?
angela No.
dwight God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?
angela What did you do to yourself?
dwight Never mind. Just never mind.
angela Well, it better work.
dwight Oh, it'll work. Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
michael How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or. being happy. And I picked. the. former.
reporter michael Scott?
michael Yes?
reporter Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
michael Umm. I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to. the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
reporter I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
michael Oh. Okay. I was talking about. what do-- what? What's going on?
