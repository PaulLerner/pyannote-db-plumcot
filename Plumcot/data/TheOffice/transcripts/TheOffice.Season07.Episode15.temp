ryan We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
kelly God baby, you know, people's reactions to this. maybe we made a mistake.

holly For what?
michael You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
holly Don't you have a sales call to go on?
michael I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
holly We don't know that.
michael Sure we do.
holly Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
michael Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
holly Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
michael Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.
holly Well you don't have to agree.
michael Yes I do.
holly No you don't.
michael Yes I do.
holly No, you can have your own opinion.

jim He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
pam Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game.
jim That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
pam All right, what'd you do?
jim Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
pam Where'd you put it?
jim Where'd I put what?
michael Let's go.

jim And the final clue.
michael Let's go!
jim You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
pam Bye.
erin holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
jim Cheer up. We made a sale.
michael Just drive faster. I want to get back.
jim Well, I'm going the speed limit. So.
michael Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.

michael No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is s*x different after the baby, Jim?
jim Alright, let me turn on some music.
michael I need to pee.
jim No you don't.
michael Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
jim Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
michael What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
jim Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
michael Well I hope I make it.
jim Hello?
helen Hi Jim, it's Helen.
jim Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
helen Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about.
jim Ok.
helen A tiny thing. I locked her in the car.
jim What?
helen She's smiling. She's happy.
jim Oh my God.
helen Jim, I don't have a spare key.
jim Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
guy Hello?

pam What's wrong?
jim Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
pam Jim, what?
jim Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
pam Oh God! What?!
jim No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
pam Ok. She's ok?
jim Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left michael at the gas station on Benet.
pam Understood.
jim And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
pam Got it. I will put out a A. P. B. Otherwise known as a "Ask pam Beasley". . Did the phone cut off?
jim Nope.
pam Alright, just call me after the doctor.
jim Ok. Bye.
pam Bye.
michael I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
attendant No, he ditched you man. I saw him drive away.
michael There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my. Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
attendant Just make it quick.
michael Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
attendant You don't know it.
michael You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.
attendant He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away.
michael Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok.
holly It's the gas station on Benet Street?
pam Yeah.
holly Ok.
erin You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
holly Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
erin It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
dwight Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
pam Cute. Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
oscar Which on in particular?
andy Yeah, which one?
pam Well the first one has a surprise factor. "I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"
andy Boo-yea!
gabe No no. No no no.
pam But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
oscar You suppose?
darryl What's it say?
oscar "I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again. "
gabe Ok. No no no.
kevin Red gloves.
darrly Keep it real.
pam You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
darryl And I will take you all down.
andy You?
darryl I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one
reason me.
andy Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
pam Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
andy Woo-hoo.
kevin I can't wait.
dwight Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial
type marsupial.
erin He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
attendant Yeah, he just left.
holly Which way did he go?
dwight Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
holly Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
attendant She's right. He went that way.
dwight Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. Let's ride.
michael Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? I'm being serious. Seriously.
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
dwight Has michael checked in?
pam Oh, hey Dwight.
dwight I asked you a question.
pam No, he hasn't.
dwight Goodbye.
pam No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought.
dwight Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
erin No.
dwight This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
pam Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out.
dwight Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
pam Ok, well it wasn't obvious so.
dwight No word from Michael.
holly Oh. . push;
pam Ta-da!
kevin Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
oscar Ok. I got one.
pam Yeah?
oscar Yes!
gabe Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
office Boo!
meredith Why?
gabe Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
darryl Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
gabe Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
oscar Irony is such a critical.
gabe Number
two no pop culture references.
pam Seriously?
oscar Wow.
gabe I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
darryl Wrap it up, Gabe.
gabe Ok final thing, and this is a fun
one Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.
gabe Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. Not every day.
gabe Go get 'em. Start quipin'.
oscar Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
pam Oh! Ok.
darryl Send me one too.
andy Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.
phyllis C. C

kevin Nice!
gabe No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
andy Do the next one.
gabe "Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island. '
darryl Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
gabe Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
phyllis Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
gabe Umm. "You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here. " Ha.
oscar That's tasteless, Gabe.
gabe Tasteless?
oscar Tasteless.
gabe More tasteless than this. "is that a palm tree or did gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it. "
pam Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
phyllis Yes.
kevin Yes, well done!
oscar Who's is it? Who wrote that?

angela Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
erin Where did he go, Holly?

dwight All right then. Someone propose a plan.
erin Okay. We fan out.
dwight Not you, Erin.
holly Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.

holly Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
erin Good. We don't need her.
dwight Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right. I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling.

andy Oh!
phyllis No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
gabe "I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull. "Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm gabe and I'm a weirdo. "
andy 
gabe "Gabe's mom. hmm. Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her. "
