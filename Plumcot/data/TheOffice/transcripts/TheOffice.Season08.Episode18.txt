andy_bernard Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
all@ What?! Why is that?
andy_bernard He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
angela_martin So, he's alive.
andy_bernard Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
angela_martin Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
andy_bernard How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
phyllis_vance If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
oscar_martinez You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure.
oscar_martinez When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
andy_bernard I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure.
oscar_martinez I am dying to know what's in there.
andy_bernard Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane.
creed_bratton Hi, hello.
andy_bernard Now, carefully... open the box.
creed_bratton It's a photo of all of us.
pam_beesly Aw, that's so sweet!
dwight_schrute A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
dwight_schrute Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!
nellie_bertram Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
robert_california California I am loving the chemistry between you two.
nellie_bertram I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
robert_california California I bet. I'm excited.
nellie_bertram Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
dwight_schrute Ah!
nellie_bertram I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
dwight_schrute You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples.
jim_halpert Oh, that reminds me. Little something from all of us.
dwight_schrute Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. Four! Oh yeah!
nellie_bertram He doesn't even care.
dwight_schrute Don't even care!
jim_halpert This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
darryl_philbin Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
andy_bernard Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
darryl_philbin I'll put you down for shortbreads.
andy_bernard Damn it.
toby_flenderson Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
darryl_philbin No. No.
toby_flenderson What?
darryl_philbin I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
toby_flenderson You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? Or chess club, or?
darryl_philbin You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
toby_flenderson That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.
darryl_philbin OK, great.
darryl_philbin All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
erin_hannon Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Elderly#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode18 Woman Oh, here let me help.
erin_hannon I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
erin_hannon Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
irene When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.
erin_hannon Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida.
irene Thank you. Oh, what kind of tea is this?
erin_hannon Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
nellie_bertram Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
robert_california California If I may, try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here.
nellie_bertram Oh.
robert_california California That's right. Your little finger.
darryl_philbin Would you like to buy some cookies?
kevin_malone Cookies, eh?
kevin_malone Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
darryl_philbin It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
kevin_malone I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
toby_flenderson Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
darryl_philbin You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
toby_flenderson No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
kevin_malone I do.
toby_flenderson See?
darryl_philbin That doesn't mean anything. Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
kevin_malone Oh, I definitely do.
darryl_philbin Huh. Hit the road, jack.
toby_flenderson No, you hit the road, jack.
kevin_malone Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
toby_flenderson You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
kevin_malone No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
angela_martin Ugh.
kevin_malone Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar.
nellie_bertram Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
jim_halpert All right. So... I guess this is it.
dwight_schrute Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win.
jim_halpert Goodbye, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo!
jim_halpert Well, he's Florida's problem now.
robert_california California I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.
jim_halpert What's that?
robert_california California I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.
jim_halpert I thought you liked the store?
robert_california California Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.
jim_halpert Thank you.
robert_california California But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us.
jim_halpert Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
robert_california California I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.
dwight_schrute Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
robert_california California Bravo, Dwight! Very good! Shame.
dwight_schrute The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre to the power of two.
nellie_bertram How did that look?
gabe_lewis I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
dwight_schrute I told you.
todd_packer Packer When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-
dwight_schrute You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
jim_halpert All right. There he is.
dwight_schrute What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
jim_halpert Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
dwight_schrute What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'?
jim_halpert Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should-
dwight_schrute You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell.
todd_packer Packer Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?
dwight_schrute Silence.
todd_packer Packer Aw, I'm just trying to-
dwight_schrute I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
todd_packer Packer That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
dwight_schrute Different guy.
jim_halpert You know, I just think you should know that-
dwight_schrute That you look like the world's tallest hobbit.
jim_halpert Well, I tried. You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
erin_hannon Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
irene Just open the program and type in his user name.
erin_hannon Can you just do it?
irene Here, type in your password.
erin_hannon 'Erin123'
irene That's a terrible password. And you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat.
erin_hannon All right.
andy_bernard Hello?
erin_hannon That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. Oh. I fixed it.
andy_bernard Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. Oh, there we go.
pam_beesly He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
jim_halpert No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
pam_beesly Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
jim_halpert I tried. He will not listen.
pam_beesly Did you actually try your hardest?
jim_halpert Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
stanley_hudson Don't talk to me.
jim_halpert Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
pam_beesly If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
jim_halpert OK. All right.
darryl_philbin What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
phyllis_vance Yeah.
kevin_malone That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
darryl_philbin Thank you.
toby_flenderson I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
darryl_philbin Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my chubby daughter?
phyllis_vance Oh.
darryl_philbin Baby, if you're watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
kelly_kapoor Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
pam_beesly Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
phyllis_vance Make them kiss each other.
meredith_palmer Make them kiss me.
erin_hannon Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
andy_bernard No.
erin_hannon This is a tanned spot.
andy_bernard I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
erin_hannon Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
andy_bernard What?
erin_hannon I have a job here. I work for an old lady.
irene Hello!
erin_hannon Andy?
andy_bernard Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.
kevin_malone This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
darryl_philbin No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
toby_flenderson No.
kevin_malone No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
darryl_philbin Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
kevin_malone Hungrier.
toby_flenderson 50?
kevin_malone Hungrier.
darryl_philbin You're not talking... triple digits?
kevin_malone Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. Again.
dwight_schrute Showtime.
jim_halpert Dwight.
dwight_schrute You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
jim_halpert OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
dwight_schrute Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
jim_halpert Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
dwight_schrute Jim, come on.
jim_halpert Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
dwight_schrute Uh-huh.
jim_halpert And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
dwight_schrute Wait. He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
jim_halpert Yes.
dwight_schrute That's two things.
jim_halpert Dwight, please.
dwight_schrute Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
jim_halpert OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
dwight_schrute You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
jim_halpert Dwight, come o-
dwight_schrute Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!
dwight_schrute Help! Help!
jim_halpert Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
dwight_schrute AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
jim_halpert Gross!
dwight_schrute Ah!
jim_halpert What? What, what, what, what, what?
dwight_schrute Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
jim_halpert I'm sorry.
dwight_schrute My wound hasn't healed yet.
jim_halpert I'm so sorry, I forgot.
dwight_schrute Oh, man!
jim_halpert You all right? You ok?
dwight_schrute Rrrah!
nellie_bertram Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
cathy_simms I don't know. He's not picking up.
todd_packer Packer Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.
nellie_bertram Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
todd_packer Packer Sup?
phyllis_vance What are you doing?
andy_bernard I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
oscar_martinez We knew. Ryan told us.
andy_bernard Ryan, why didn't you tell me?
ryan_howard Thought you checker my Tumblr?
andy_bernard You never update it.
ryan_howard Well, I updated it.
andy_bernard Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
pam_beesly We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine.
dwight_schrute Huh, huh, huh!
jim_halpert What are you doing?
dwight_schrute I was trying to go-
jim_halpert Get up.
dwight_schrute Ok, ok.
jim_halpert Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
dwight_schrute Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
jim_halpert OK. What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
dwight_schrute Jackie Chan!
kevin_malone Go.
darryl_philbin Hi. This is Alex.
toby_flenderson And this is Sam.
darryl_philbin Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
kevin_malone Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
darryl_philbin I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
toby_flenderson Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
kevin_malone Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
toby_flenderson Don't make me be your pony, Kevin.
darryl_philbin Forget it, man.
kevin_malone What do you mean?
darryl_philbin I'm out. And so is Toby.
darryl_philbin This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
toby_flenderson Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
kevin_malone No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. That is... hmph... that's ah... so good.
jim_halpert What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
dwight_schrute This. Ends. Now.
jim_halpert This is dangerous.
dwight_schrute Rrahh!
jim_halpert Why?
dwight_schrute Anything else you need to talk about?
jim_halpert Nope. I think that was it.
dwight_schrute Once again, it's show time.
robert_california California What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution.
todd_packer Packer If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.
robert_california California I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.
nellie_bertram Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
robert_california California That was never on the table.
todd_packer Packer Are you kidding? She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!
robert_california California And yet Todd, it's you who's fired.
todd_packer Packer What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh?
darryl_philbin Hey, hey. They're back.
kelly_kapoor Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
jim_halpert Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
kelly_kapoor Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
phyllis_vance Hey! Good to have you back.
stanley_hudson Good to be back.
pam_beesly Hey, stranger!
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Aw, I missed you.
jim_halpert I missed you.
pam_beesly Aw.
andy_bernard I'm going to Florida to get Erin. Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
