michael_scott Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
dwight_schrute Yes. But this seems to be...
michael_scott And now, the chains.
michael_scott A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
michael_scott MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
dwight_schrute I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
michael_scott No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
jim_halpert Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
michael_scott I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
pam_beesly So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
michael_scott No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.
michael_scott AHHHH!
kevin_malone Is everything ok, Michael?
michael_scott Yes.
michael_scott I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
michael_scott Alright.
dwight_schrute
michael_scott Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
jim_halpert Another worm? Like, are they friends?
dwight_schrute It's early bird gets the worm.
michael_scott Pam, would you smell my breath?
pam_beesly No, no.
dwight_schrute Let me smell. Good, not great.
michael_scott "Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
michael_scott Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
jim_halpert Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
michael_scott Sure? Might be a good idea.
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
jim_halpert Thanks.
michael_scott Play some games?
jim_halpert Oh. Um. I think we're good.
michael_scott I spy?
jim_halpert Yeah.
jim_halpert Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
dwight_schrute Thanks for inviting me along.
michael_scott Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? Heh-woh you.
jan_levinson Michael?
michael_scott Hey, Buttercup.
jan_levinson Hi.
michael_scott I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
jan_levinson Let's just blow this party off.
michael_scott That's what she said.
jan_levinson Am I on speaker phone?
michael_scott Uh, yes you are.
jan_levinson Is anybody else in the...
dwight_schrute Hello, Jan.
jan_levinson Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
michael_scott No problem.
jan_levinson Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
michael_scott Ok.
jan_levinson ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
michael_scott Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
jan_levinson Still on speaker?
michael_scott Ummm... I don't know.
jan_levinson Are camera's there?
michael_scott Maybe.
jan_levinson See you soon.
michael_scott Ok.
dwight_schrute Talk to you later, Jan.
michael_scott Alright. Bye.
pam_beesly Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
roy_anderson I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
pam_beesly Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
roy_anderson Ok.
pam_beesly I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
michael_scott Beauty. Thank you sir!
dwight_schrute Salad.
michael_scott Thank you.
dwight_schrute You dressed exactly like the servants.
michael_scott Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
dwight_schrute Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
michael_scott I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
dwight_schrute That would have been really embarrassing.
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Crisis averted.
michael_scott Ok.
pam_beesly Oh, that duck is so cute.
kevin_malone Hey Pam.
pam_beesly Hey guys.
kevin_malone Oscar. Angela.
michael_scott Hi.
michael_scott Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
michael_scott Oh, um, potato salad.
dwight_schrute It's from both of us.
michael_scott No, it's not.
rachel_wallace Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.
michael_scott Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
michael_scott It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
pam_beesly Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
kevin_malone Yeah.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, when is it?
kevin_malone It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
roy_anderson Hey.
pam_beesly Hey. You made it.
roy_anderson You said it was important, so... How's it going?
kenny_anderson What's up, Pam.
pam_beesly Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
roy_anderson You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
all@ Yeah.
roy_anderson Yeah? Get you a drink.
kenny_anderson Thanks man.
angela_martin No thank you, Roy.
dwight_schrute Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
michael_scott What are you looking for? You bring dip?
jan_levinson I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
michael_scott Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
jan_levinson You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
michael_scott Over our love.
jan_levinson I've never told you that I love you.
michael_scott You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
jan_levinson I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
jan_levinson What's this over the "i"?
michael_scott It's a heart.
jan_levinson Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
michael_scott I love this woman!
jan_levinson Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
dwight_schrute Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
dan_gore Gore No.
dwight_schrute No? Then you are an idiot.
rachel_wallace Hello Michael.
michael_scott Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
david_wallace Jan, glad you could make it.
jan_levinson Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
david_wallace Of course I do.
jan_levinson From the Scranton Branch.
michael_scott Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
jan_levinson David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
rachel_wallace Excuse me.
michael_scott Ok.
pam_beesly Oh. No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
bartender Oh, sorry.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode17 So did the merger go smoothly, or?
michael_scott It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
karen_filippelli I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
michael_scott Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
jan_levinson We're good. Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
rachel_wallace Can I get anyone anything, or?
michael_scott I could go for an appeteaser.
jan_levinson Martini please.
michael_scott Bagel bites or something.
karen_filippelli Rachel, your house is beautiful.
rachel_wallace Thank you.
dwight_schrute What's the square footage?
david_wallace About 5,000.
dwight_schrute Does that include the garage?
michael_scott Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
dwight_schrute I'm just...
david_wallace I don't know
dwight_schrute It's a common question.
michael_scott David, how much did this house cost?
dwight_schrute These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
rachel_wallace I'll show you around.
dwight_schrute Cool, let's start with the banisters.
karen_filippelli Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
jim_halpert Yep.
karen_filippelli That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
jim_halpert Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
karen_filippelli And it didn't end well.
jim_halpert Gotcha. Alright.
david_wallace This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
michael_scott Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.
jan_levinson You ok?
michael_scott Yeah. Do you have any ice?
david_wallace Sure.
michael_scott How about some Splenda?
roy_anderson One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
kenny_anderson Where?
roy_anderson On this side.
kevin_malone No, it is definitely under one of these hands.
ryan_howard I think I heard it on Roy's side.
kevin_malone No, it is here.
ryan_howard Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
kevin_malone Good thing you didn't listen to me.
ryan_howard Yeah, close one.
roy_anderson Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. Not here. .
kenny_anderson YES!
pam_beesly Nice job.
roy_anderson I can read you like a book.
pam_beesly Oh yeah?
roy_anderson You can't keep anything from me.
Student#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode17 1 Hey Creed.
creed_bratton Hey! What are you guys doing here?
Student#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode17 2 You're the man buddy.
creed_bratton I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
dwight_schrute Huh. Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? .
rachel_wallace Uh, that's a guest room.
dwight_schrute Just the one window?
rachel_wallace Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me.
dwight_schrute Are those real pearls?
rachel_wallace Uh, yes.
dwight_schrute Good.
jim_halpert Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
karen_filippelli Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
jim_halpert Oh. Hadn't noticed.
karen_filippelli Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
jim_halpert No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
michael_scott This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
jan_levinson It's nice.
michael_scott You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
jan_levinson I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
michael_scott Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
jim_halpert Oh.
michael_scott Crazy.
jan_levinson I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
michael_scott Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
jan_levinson Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just.
michael_scott What are you doing?
jan_levinson Don't you know what I'm doing?
michael_scott Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
jan_levinson Shut up.
michael_scott What has gotten into you?
jan_levinson Come on.
michael_scott No, no, no.
jan_levinson What?
michael_scott Come on, let's go back to the party.
jan_levinson Just let me loosen my dress.
michael_scott Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
jan_levinson Slam me up against the wall, right here.
michael_scott I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
jan_levinson Oh, please.
michael_scott You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
jan_levinson Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.
toby_flenderson Here.
pam_beesly Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
toby_flenderson I was...
pam_beesly Hey, don't you have a daughter?
toby_flenderson Yes.
dwight_schrute Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
eightyearold_kid I don't know, it was here when I was born.
dwight_schrute I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
eightyearold_kid I don't know.
dwight_schrute What do you know?
david_wallace God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
jim_halpert You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
karen_filippelli Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
jim_halpert Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? Wow. Ok. You got me.
karen_filippelli I so got you.
jim_halpert So, none of them?
karen_filippelli Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
jim_halpert Really?
karen_filippelli Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.
jim_halpert Ok.
karen_filippelli Hey Jan.
jan_levinson Not too good.
rachel_wallace Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad?
michael_scott Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
david_wallace What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?
jim_halpert I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
dwight_schrute The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
roy_anderson What?
pam_beesly I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
roy_anderson That's awesome. That's what I want.
pam_beesly Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
roy_anderson I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
pam_beesly Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
roy_anderson What?
pam_beesly He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
roy_anderson Jim came on to you?
pam_beesly Just listen.
roy_anderson No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
pam_beesly Don't yell!
roy_anderson Don't yell?!
pam_beesly This is over.
roy_anderson Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
kenny_anderson Damn jet skis!
michael_scott Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
jan_levinson I feel sick.
michael_scott You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
jan_levinson No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
michael_scott Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
jan_levinson Please don't cry.
michael_scott I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
jan_levinson It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
michael_scott I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
jan_levinson I didn't mean it. I was...
michael_scott Whatever.
jan_levinson Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
michael_scott That's all, you didn't mean it?
jan_levinson That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
michael_scott I love you, Jan.
jan_levinson Ok.
dwight_schrute Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
roy_anderson Are they going to call the cops?
kenny_anderson No, I paid them off.
roy_anderson Jet ski money?
kenny_anderson All of it.
roy_anderson I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
