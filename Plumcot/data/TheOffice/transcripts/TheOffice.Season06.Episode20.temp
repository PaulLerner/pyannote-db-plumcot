michael Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. Do you know who that is?
jim No.
michael Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans.
jim Is he you?
michael I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
jim Where did you take that?
michael In my condo complex.
jim Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
michael I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
jim Sure. That they should do one.
michael Hey, Jim, jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
jim Who's that?
michael Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
jim John Dillinger.
michael No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
jim Captain Crunch.
michael Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
jim At the Yankees game. Yeah.
michael Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
jim I had a little better reason to believe that. You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp.
michael I know, I know.
jim . in your condo complex.
michael I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
jim M. Night Shulman?
michael First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
stanley When are we getting to sales topics?
dwight Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
michael Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50, 000 to get from a market research company. are not here yet. But will be. No, no, meeting's not over.
phyllis But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
michael No sales topic per se.
andy Well then no andy Bernard per se.
michael Dwight?
dwight Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
michael I would like your undivided attention, please.
dwight You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
michael Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work
was make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
dwight Listen, michael - about what happened earlier.
michael Yeah.
dwight When I was asking about the leads.
michael M-hmm.
dwight . is there any news on the leads?
michael Is that all you have to say to me?
dwight Yeah. You got any news on the leads? . Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! Alright, dwight out!
dwight Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
angela Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
phyllis Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
michael Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque.
jim Oh, sorry, wait one second.
michael Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
jim This is actually a big potential sale, so.
michael You writing your memoirs over there?
jim You writing your name over there?
michael Well, it's a pretty big check.
jim That's good. You know, with the kid.
michael Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
jim Alright, here we go. Michael.
michael I'm just saying, that -
jim michael - Great.
andy Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy. I'm making a sale. Sales.
darryl There's other pencil's in this office.
andy Give me that
michael Honey and jelly sandwich time.
darryl Michael.
michael Oh, you got to be kidding me. Look at that. That's -
darryl I know who did that.
michael You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
darryl Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
michael The sales department smashed my sandwich.
darryl Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
michael You don't get it.
darryl You need to get back on top.
michael That's what she said.
darryl Yeah.
michael Yeah.
erin Something came for you, Michael.
michael Thank you very much.
jim What'd you get?
michael Ah, just the stupid leads.
jim Alright!
stanley About time.
andy Me likey!
phyllis Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
michael Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim. I think I am not going to give these to you.
stanley We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
gabe Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
michael Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
gabe Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
michael They act like I have no power.
gabe But you do. You are in charge -
miichael Thank you.
gabe - of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
michael Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
gabe Okay, good.
michael Exactly that.
gabe Good.
michael Exactly that.
gabe Why do you keep repeating -
michael Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to. King Creed!
phyllis What are you -
michael - and to King Meredith!
stanley They aren't salespeople!
michael And to King Angela! Because today we are all kings. And queens .
phyllis What the hell do you think you're doing?
michael I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
jim Hey.
michael Hey.
jim So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
michael Mm-hmm.
jim Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
michael Okay.
jim Hey, alright.
michael Alright.
jim Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
michael Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
jim I don't think you understand -
michael I do understand it.
jim This one's a map.
michael Or is it?
angela Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
phyllis Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
angela I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work
phyllis What are these for?
angela It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
kelly I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
ryan It's my -
stanley The Kardashians is a good show.
ryan No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
kelly It's about a family. A real-life family.
ryan No, Stanley, do you -
pam Hey baby, what's up?
jim I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
pam Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
jim Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more. . push;
jim Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies - that's just unfair.
jim How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place. '
pam He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
jim I love you.
michael Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. A lesser manager would have screwed this day up
royally 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing Some people shouldn't be in this business.
andy Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
erin Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. I hid the leads.
andy Where?
erin Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
andy Are you.
erin Lower.
andy Are you sure?
erin Lower
dwight What are you doing, idiot?
jim Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
dwight Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president. '
jim Lincoln.
dwight The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
jim It involves you too.
dwight The leads are in?
dwight Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
michael Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
dwight Kevin! Damnit Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
kevin You are never going to find them.
dwight Really.
kevin I'm going to enjoy this.
dwight Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
kevin I'm still enjoying it.
dwight Where are they?
kevin Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
dwight Turn the trash It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
meredith Okey-dokey.
kevin No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
meredith It's coming off anyway.
dwight Clean sack.
kevin What -
erin I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
toby If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
dwight It's empty!
michael Wait. What day is today?
kevin Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
michael Oh my god. Oh my god oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey wait, wait!
michael Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -
phyllis Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
michael Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump. "
stanley Not your staff, Michael. You.
michael Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
toby Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
michael Really?
angela I'm not going. You did this, not us.
michael Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit Complicit. You were all successories!
darryl That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
michael You can.
darryl I can't. You know that.
michael Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
dwight I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
dwight This place has gone to hell.
michael You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
dwight Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
michael Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
kelly You're adorable. You need to go for it. I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
jim Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
kelly Why?
jim Just all the - drama.
kelly What drama?
jim Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
kelly So unnecessary.
jim Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that.
kelly I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
jim I have new baby pictures.
kelly Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
jim She's wearing a onesie
stanley If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
jim Didn't we kind of start it?
phyllis I think you're remembering that wrong?
andy Yeah.
phyllis I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
jim Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
andy All those who agree, say aye All those opposed -
jim I don't think we need opposed.
michael You've changed, man.
dwight Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
michael Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
dwight Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
michael No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
dwight When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
michael Assistant to the managed him -
dwight Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
michael Yeah.
dwight Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
michael You think you would have done better without me? Really?
dwight I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
michael Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
dwight Kung-fu movies!
michael You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
dwight Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
michael That's my wife you're talking about, man.
dwight Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? You watch it!
michael If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
dwight Don't do it
michael No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. No, time out, time out. Time in!
dwight No!
michael Don't even think about that
dwight Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
phyllis What's the least we can do to make this okay?
jim I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
andy And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
phyllis I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
stanley That is a dangerous precedent.
jim pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
phyllis Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
jim Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
phyllis Okay, fine. Cash it is.
andy erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches".
michael Okay, Dwight. Here we go oh god.
dwight Oh
michael We're never going to find those leads, are we?
dwight Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
phyllis So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
jim No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay Hey everybody!
meredith Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
jim No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel
is really sorry.
andy Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
phyllis Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So.
oscar Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
kevin Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
angela Do you have any pastries without fruit?
jim Yes! We do. Eclairs.
stanley Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
jim - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
phyllis Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
stanley This is - nice! All of us back together.
michael This Why would somebody throw that out?
dwight Hey You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
michael Yeah, she does - she loves purple. Does it stink?
dwight Yeah
michael Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would
read 
dwight Hope - grows.
michael In the dump.
dwight Woo hoo!
stanley Good news that you found our leads?
michael No! Better!
dwight We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.
phyllis Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
dwight Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and michael only
andy It's freezing out here.
erin Go on. I have warm blood.
andy Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met.
