michael Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
dwight Do it.
michael Quiz me up.
ryan All right, um. Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years?
michael Uh.
michael When I was Ryan's age, I worked in a fast food restaurant, to save up money for school. And then I spe. lost it in a pyramid scheme. But I learned more about business, right then and there, than business school would ever teach me, or ryan would ever teach me.
ryan Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
dwight Keep an existing.
michael Shut, it. Can I. can I just do it please? Uh, it's equal.
ryan It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer.
michael Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
dwight Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
michael Okay, Dwight.
dwight Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
michael You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know. Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then. then you'd know what you're talking about.
dwight Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
michael For instance, why don't you go to business.
dwight You should learn from him, right?
ryan I am.
dwight Right?
ryan I am.
michael Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company. and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
dwight Stupid! . push;
michael I did not go to business school. You know who else didn't go to business school? LeBron James, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant. They went right from high school to the NBA. So. so it's not the same thing. At all.
michael Look at this stuff. Market fragments. What is that supposed to be?
ryan It's a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base.
michael You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
