dwight_schrute
jim_halpert Why?
dwight_schrute Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes.
pam_beesly Do you mind?
dwight_schrute I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
pam_beesly You don't have to do that.
dwight_schrute D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
jim_halpert Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
dwight_schrute
jim_halpert Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
dwight_schrute Uhh, aah!
jim_halpert Well, A for effort right?
dwight_schrute
hank Welcome, start your morning right with a burst of blueberry. Or try plain.
andy_bernard What's the occasion?
hank Dwight said this entry was a waste of space.
andy_bernard I would like a muffa du blueberry por favor.
hank Eight dollars.
andy_bernard Eight dollars?
dwight_schrute Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
michael_scott Mmhmm, China. China.
erin_hannon How was the dentist?
michael_scott It was great. China.
pam_beesly Are you okay, what's wrong?
michael_scott Everything here was made in China, Pam.
andy_bernard Yeah, its where they make stuff.
michael_scott They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
erin_hannon Oh, no.
michael_scott Yeah, right here. It is right there. Anybody read the news any more?
dwight_schrute China is on the move?
michael_scott I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
michael_scott My whole life I believed that America was number one, that was the saying. Not America is number two. England is number two. China should be like eight.
darryl_philbin Hey Andy.
andy_bernard Hey Darryl.
darryl_philbin You gotta stop texting me so much.
andy_bernard But I wanted you to know that Michael and I are wearing the same tie today. It's insane.
darryl_philbin You need to change your standard for what's worthy of a text. Ask yourself is this something Darryl needs to know. The answers almost always no.
andy_bernard Got it. Then I will call you.
darryl_philbin No.
darryl_philbin There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. "I'm coming over baby." And I would text back "BTB", bring that booty.
stanley_hudson Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
dwight_schrute I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
pam_beesly Umm, Stanley. Maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to...
stanley_hudson Don't tell me how to do my business.
dwight_schrute Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
jim_halpert Which is you.
dwight_schrute "Which is you" is not a sentence.
jim_halpert I disagree with.
stanley_hudson Are you just gonna sit there, Office Administrator, or are you going to do something?
pam_beesly Dwight, can we talk about these cutbacks.
dwight_schrute Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
pam_beesly I'm not going to do that.
dwight_schrute Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
nate Y'ello.
pam_beesly Hi Nate, Its Pam Halpert.
nate Oh, hey Pam.
pam_beesly Hey, I would just love to schedule a meeting today with Dwight.
nate Let me put you on hold for just one 'eensy sec.
pam_beesly Sure.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
nate Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
pam_beesly Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
dwight_schrute You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity.
erin_hannon Oh my God.
michael_scott What?
erin_hannon According to the internet, the tallest man in the world is Chinese.
michael_scott So much for keeping our secrets up high.
erin_hannon What's America gonna do?
michael_scott I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
michael_scott Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.
angela_martin You never told us to close them.
michael_scott Welcome to your future.
phyllis_vance What do we do? How do we stop this?
michael_scott How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
pam_beesly An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?
michael_scott Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
kevin_malone An antacid that you only take once a week.
michael_scott Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
kevin_malone Michael! An antacid pill that you take once every six weeks.
stanley_hudson Why not just go one for the year?
michael_scott I don't know.
kevin_malone It's too big of a pill to swallow.
michael_scott Alright.
erin_hannon What if we all get together and help each other and hire a new guy, and then we all kill him, but first we take out like a hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. I bet you guys like that idea don't you?
erin_hannon I think that's what they're doing to me. I can't prove it, but I wanted to see their faces when I said it. I learned nothing.
michael_scott I don't know what the that was.
dwight_schrute I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
phyllis_vance Yeah, Dwight's right we should drop a bomb.
michael_scott No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
erin_hannon
oscar_martinez Actually, that's not true. I know the figure you're referring to, and it's a projection of fifteen years from now.
kevin_malone Thank God.
michael_scott No, no. That is right now.
oscar_martinez Michael, China's agrarian. Urbanizing fast? You bet 'cha, but still agrarian.
michael_scott In terms of land, not population.
oscar_martinez Come on Michael. You can...
michael_scott No, no you're wrong about this.
oscar_martinez Where are you getting this information?
michael_scott I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
kevin_malone Uh oh, getting nervous Oscar?
jim_halpert Okay, someone look it up.
ryan_howard I'm on it Jim. I'm on it.
oscar_martinez Guys its not worth it really. Guys this is not worth our time.
darryl_philbin "Are you watching this?" Seriously?
andy_bernard Well are you?
darryl_philbin I'm sitting right here.
ryan_howard Got it. China has fifty six cities with a population of over one million. The US has... nine.
meredith_palmer Suck it Oscar.
jim_halpert Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
oscar_martinez Great. I was wrong. I'm wrong. Is everyone happy?
michael_scott So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? I don't care.
michael_scott Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?
meredith_palmer Wow, so this building can get uglier.
stanley_hudson I will not work in a roach billboard.
gabe_lewis Oh my God, I can't look at roaches.
angela_martin Michael do something about this.
michael_scott Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
pam_beesly Dwight take it down.
dwight_schrute
pam_beesly I'm serious, take it down or else.
dwight_schrute Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
pam_beesly We can move out.
angela_martin Really?
pam_beesly So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?
jim_halpert Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
pam_beesly I went out to look for a better office space.
dwight_schrute Waste of time.
pam_beesly Not really, because I found one.
jim_halpert Oh wow, these are nice.
pam_beesly Yup.
dwight_schrute Let me see.
pam_beesly Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
jim_halpert Yeah, yeah. Totally.
dwight_schrute You can't just move out.
pam_beesly Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.
andy_bernard Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.
pam_beesly They're not of Cece.
andy_bernard Oh, cool.
pam_beesly This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.
phyllis_vance Well I like being in the same building as Bob. Keeps me honest.
pam_beesly Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.
stanley_hudson Are you trying to kill me?
kelly_kapoor Is the nail place Koreans or whites?
pam_beesly Koreans.
kelly_kapoor Good. And the dry cleaners?
pam_beesly White.
kelly_kapoor Good.
jim_halpert Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.
oscar_martinez Funny Jim. That is funny.
michael_scott Very comedically humorous Jim.
kelly_kapoor I have a computer question. Hey Oscar?
oscar_martinez What is it?
kelly_kapoor Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael?
oscar_martinez Alright. Alright I get it.
kelly_kapoor Michael, how do I create a new tab?
michael_scott Try 'Control P'.
oscar_martinez That's print.
michael_scott Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
kelly_kapoor Oscar it must be killing you to know that Michael is smarter than you.
oscar_martinez He's... he's not smarter than me, he was just right about one thing.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, but it was a really smart thing to be right about, actually.
ryan_howard Actually, it was.
jim_halpert Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.
darryl_philbin Megan Fox. Question mark. What's that mean?
andy_bernard Megan Fox! Come on!
darryl_philbin You know what, you're one bad text away from getting blocked.
andy_bernard Yes, but one good text away from a high five.
darryl_philbin You accept these terms?
andy_bernard Oh, its on.
dwight_schrute In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
kevin_malone Well, I wish for a million wishes.
dwight_schrute Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
kevin_malone Then see you later building.
dwight_schrute You can't possibly be serious.
kevin_malone I said see you later building.
oscar_martinez Hey Michael.
michael_scott Hey.
oscar_martinez I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
michael_scott Mmm.
oscar_martinez I'd love to talk more about it.
michael_scott Yeah.
oscar_martinez Maybe over some coffee later?
michael_scott Sure.
jim_halpert Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
michael_scott Coffee Jim.
jim_halpert No.
andy_bernard It is not just coffee.
jim_halpert He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
michael_scott Yes.
andy_bernard And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.
michael_scott Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
jim_halpert No politics?
michael_scott I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California." What?
dwight_schrute Parley, my office, five minutes.
pam_beesly Parley?
creed_bratton Pirate code, he wants to meet.
pam_beesly So everyone here knows pirate code?
creed_bratton I understand it, I can't speak it.
dwight_schrute Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
pam_beesly You've been watering down the soap?
dwight_schrute Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
pam_beesly We need everything back the way it was.
dwight_schrute You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping.
pam_beesly That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed.
ryan_howard Where is Tibet?
michael_scott Pass.
ryan_howard When was China founded?
michael_scott Pass.
jim_halpert Two for two, keep it up.
ryan_howard Who is Mao?
michael_scott Lifeline.
andy_bernard Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
michael_scott I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
jim_halpert What do you know about boobs?
andy_bernard Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.
jim_halpert Thank you.
andy_bernard This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
michael_scott Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
andy_bernard I'm like a quarter of the way through.
michael_scott Is it going to be worth it?
andy_bernard No.
ryan_howard Just in case Michael, I made you a cheat sheet.
michael_scott I don't need to cheat.
jim_halpert Show him how to use it.
nate Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
dwight_schrute Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
nate Yeah.
dwight_schrute There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
nate The building's underground?
dwight_schrute She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
dwight_schrute & Nate Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam.
other_pam Yeah?
nate Pam. Pam?
dwight_schrute What?
other_pam I'm Pam.
dwight_schrute Oh.
nate No you're not.
dwight_schrute I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
other_pam Oh, that's fine.
dwight_schrute So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
other_pam I've been known to bend the truth.
dwight_schrute Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
other_pam Okay.
dwight_schrute I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
dwight_schrute Hey Pam.
pam_beesly Yeah?
dwight_schrute Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
pam_beesly I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
dwight_schrute Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
pam_beesly Uhh, I think it's something like umm...
dwight_schrute What's the exact square footage.
pam_beesly Umm, let me see.
dwight_schrute How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
pam_beesly Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
dwight_schrute You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say "Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait.
pam_beesly Mmhmm.
pam_beesly I lied about some aspects of the building.
jim_halpert It's still on a bike path though right?
pam_beesly There's no building... it doesn't exist.
jim_halpert What does that mean?
pam_beesly I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
jim_halpert But you didn't fail.
pam_beesly And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.
jim_halpert And you didn't fail those things either.
pam_beesly Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?
jim_halpert Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
oscar_martinez Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
michael_scott Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
oscar_martinez We have missiles too.
michael_scott Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
nate I wasn't here.
pam_beesly What?
nate I wasn't here. It's a pretty common saying. You may want to log it away for future use.
pam_beesly Well thanks.
nate Yeah.
michael_scott China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.
oscar_martinez Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
michael_scott How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
oscar_martinez Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
michael_scott Don't... I...
pam_beesly Hello, hello. You're breaking the law.
dwight_schrute Impossible, I love the law.
pam_beesly Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
dwight_schrute I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
nate I don't think it goes that way.
dwight_schrute Reply it!
oscar_martinez Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
michael_scott Yeah, I figured that.
oscar_martinez Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
michael_scott Wait. You forgetting something?
oscar_martinez What?
michael_scott This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
erin_hannon Fire him. No, show mercy.
michael_scott Here we are.
oscar_martinez What's your point.
michael_scott My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
andy_bernard Yeah.
erin_hannon Right, yes.
michael_scott I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
oscar_martinez That's not.
michael_scott Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
oscar_martinez That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
dwight_schrute They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
darryl_philbin Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
andy_bernard Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away.
darryl_philbin That's a text.
andy_bernard Yeah. Right.
darryl_philbin That's your new standard.
