dwight_schrute Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
ryan_howard A dime and a nickel.
dwight_schrute No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
ryan_howard But the other one is. I've heard that before.
dwight_schrute Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
ryan_howard Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.
dwight_schrute A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
ryan_howard He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.
dwight_schrute A hunter.
ryan_howard It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.
dwight_schrute Damn it!
jan_levinson Tell me what you did yesterday.
michael_scott Uhhh... nothing.
jan_levinson Nothing?
michael_scott Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
jan_levinson I don't care how your day was Michael.
michael_scott Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
jan_levinson Tell me what you did yesterday.
michael_scott I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?
michael_scott Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.
jan_levinson Hi, Pam.
pam_beesly Hi.
jan_levinson I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?
pam_beesly Oh, I don't know if I'm...
jan_levinson Thanks Pam.
pam_beesly It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
dwight_schrute So you excited?
ryan_howard Yeah.
dwight_schrute Very excited?
ryan_howard Yes. I'm very excited.
dwight_schrute Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.
ryan_howard I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
dwight_schrute I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
ryan_howard So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? So where's the sales office?
dwight_schrute When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
karen_filippelli Hey.
jim_halpert What?
karen_filippelli My chair is squeaking.
jim_halpert Is it?
karen_filippelli You took my chair.
jim_halpert No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.
karen_filippelli When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...
jim_halpert So I guess I can't get up.
michael_scott Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
dwight_schrute Do you know where we are, temp?
ryan_howard I know where we're not.
dwight_schrute I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. AH! When... Damn it.
andy_bernard Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.
jim_halpert Sure.
andy_bernard Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?
karen_filippelli That's it? That's what you came up with?
andy_bernard I'm acting my heart out here.
karen_filippelli Really?
andy_bernard Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.
Announcer#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode05 Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.
pam_beesly Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.
michael_scott Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.
michael_scott Oh, shhh... Come on.
dwight_schrute And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
ryan_howard I don't think you know what you're saying.
dwight_schrute Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
ryan_howard Uh huh.
dwight_schrute It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
ryan_howard Gotcha.
dwight_schrute Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back.
ryan_howard Ok. Of course.
stanley_hudson I wake up every morning in a bed that's too small, drive my daughter to a school that's too expensive, and then I go to work to a job for which I get paid too little, but on Pretzel Day? Well, I like pretzel day.
kelly_kapoor Because they acted all tough and everything...
michael_scott Uh huh.
kelly_kapoor But what they were rapping about was cupcakes and the Chronicles of Narnia. God. Who invented cupcakes, right? I want to...
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
phyllis_vance I'm just saying hi to Bob.
michael_scott No, I think you're cutting in line.
bob_vance Well settle down, Scott.
michael_scott No, I'm not going to settle down.
stanley_hudson No way.
michael_scott Get in the back please.
stanley_hudson Boooooo. Booooo. Back of the line.
michael_scott Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right.
bob_vance What a pair of Mary's.
stanley_hudson This is Pretzel Day.
ryan_howard Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
dwight_schrute Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
karen_filippelli
jim_halpert Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
karen_filippelli stop.
jim_halpert Go on and fool me. Love me, love me, say that you love me
karen_filippelli This is not fair, this is going to be in my head all day. Please.
jim_halpert fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
karen_filippelli This is not a proportionate response.
jim_halpert Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
andy_bernard I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?
pam_beesly Michael.
michael_scott No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.
pam_beesly Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.
michael_scott I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
pam_beesly Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.
michael_scott Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
pam_beesly You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.
michael_scott Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
dwight_schrute It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
ryan_howard Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
dwight_schrute You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
ryan_howard Yeah.
dwight_schrute Come on!
stanley_hudson Thank you!
michael_scott Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
pretzel_vendor guy We do.
michael_scott Thank God.
pretzel_vendor guy And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar.
michael_scott Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
pretzel_vendor guy The Works. You got it.
michael_scott All right! Thank you!
dwight_schrute Please be seated.
ryan_howard Who was that?
dwight_schrute Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
ryan_howard Is that your Cousin Mose?
dwight_schrute Yes.
dwight_schrute Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
dwight_schrute What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
ryan_howard Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
dwight_schrute Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
ryan_howard Depression?
dwight_schrute Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
kelly_kapoor I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?
angela_martin Sales take a long time.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, I'm so worried.
angela_martin I'm sure Dwight will protect him.
kelly_kapoor I don't know. Dwight's so weird.
angela_martin He's not weird, he's just individualistic.
kelly_kapoor No, he's a freak.
angela_martin You're a freak!
dwight_schrute Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
ryan_howard Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
dwight_schrute Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
ryan_howard No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.
dwight_schrute Wrestle him to the ground.
ryan_howard No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
dwight_schrute Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
mose Mose Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice.
dwight_schrute Where are all the animals?
dwight_schrute Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
dwight_schrute You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
ryan_howard Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
dwight_schrute Screwgun. The sales call!
kevin_malone Hey! Hey!
michael_scott Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
dwight_schrute Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
ryan_howard Wait, can you go back?
dwight_schrute Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
ryan_howard Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
dwight_schrute Good.
ryan_howard I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars".
dwight_schrute Right.
ryan_howard I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
dwight_schrute Uh huh.
ryan_howard Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
dwight_schrute Exactly. Yes.
ryan_howard I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.
michael_scott Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...
toby_flenderson Second?
michael_scott Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
kevin_malone Account...? Michael, what is going on?
michael_scott And I will be taking questions.
pam_beesly Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?
phyllis_vance What's on your suit?
michael_scott Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
ryan_howard They really didn't like me.
dwight_schrute They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
ryan_howard I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
dwight_schrute Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
ryan_howard You drive.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
dwight_schrute Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
ryan_howard I think about that all the time.
kevin_malone Night, Pam.
pam_beesly Night.
michael_scott Hey, what time is it?
pam_beesly 20 past 5.
michael_scott AM or PM?
pam_beesly PM.
michael_scott Oh, good.
pam_beesly These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?
michael_scott Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
pam_beesly This is a huge sale.
michael_scott Yes. Right. Good.
pam_beesly Night, Michael.
michael_scott Goodnight!
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin.
jim_halpert Ah, hey.
pam_beesly Oh my God.
jim_halpert Hi.
pam_beesly Hi.
jim_halpert Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
pam_beesly I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.
jim_halpert Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?
pam_beesly Yeah, totally. So...
jim_halpert So...
pam_beesly Do you...
jim_halpert Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
pam_beesly Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.
jim_halpert Oh, good.
pam_beesly A little different. What time is it there?
jim_halpert What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.
pam_beesly Oh, yeah. Right.
jim_halpert How far away did you think we were?
pam_beesly I don't know. It felt far.
jim_halpert Yeah. I have a question for you.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert How many words per minute does the average person type?
pam_beesly I type 90.
jim_halpert Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.
pam_beesly It's true.
jim_halpert Ok, I said average.
pam_beesly 70? How many do you type?
jim_halpert Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
pam_beesly Come on. Tell me.
jim_halpert No.
pam_beesly You have to tell me now.
jim_halpert 65. Ok, no need to laugh.
pam_beesly No, it's, that's respectable.
jim_halpert Respectable?
pam_beesly So ok. I'm watching the movie, by myself...
jim_halpert Right.
pam_beesly Because I just wanted a relaxing evening at home...
jim_halpert Ok.
pam_beesly And, I'm freaking out.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly That movie is so scary!
jim_halpert I know!
pam_beesly But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.
jim_halpert No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
pam_beesly Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.
jim_halpert No, you're making this up!
pam_beesly Would I make that up?
jim_halpert Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.
jim_halpert And how many kitchens?
pam_beesly I have one kitchen.
jim_halpert Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
pam_beesly It's actually...
jim_halpert Most apartments these days have like three.
pam_beesly Three kitchens?
jim_halpert Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
pam_beesly Hey, Ryan, are you ok?
jim_halpert Pam?
ryan_howard Yeah. Yeah.
jim_halpert Pam?
pam_beesly Um. Ok, bye.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
pam_beesly No, I was um...
jim_halpert Oh, no no.
pam_beesly You have to go?
jim_halpert Yeah, uh, well.
pam_beesly No, I should probably go too.
jim_halpert Ok.
pam_beesly I mean, yeah.
jim_halpert Yeah. Bye Pam.
pam_beesly Bye Jim.
stanley_hudson Three hundred and sixty four days, 'till the next Pretzel Day.
