gabe Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
dwight Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? Mwah.
gabe I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They'd flex them all night at the discotheque.
dwight Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh?
gabe Yeah.
dwight Oh, please.
gabe Core's critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate.
jim Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that – flat curl contest.
jim all right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
dwight Feast on this, Lewis.
gabe I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
jim Come on, Gabe, you can't handle his hamstrings. You're getting hypno-thigh-zed.
gabe Speed set. One. Two.
jim Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
dwight Oh, thank you.
jim You're welcome.
gabe Five. Six.
jim Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
all Eight, nine, ten.
gabe We got it?
dwight Very funny Jim.
gabe Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
robert Everyone, conference room, now.
jim all right, easy there, grandpa.
dwight I don't need your help.
jim Okay. You don't need my help?
dwight Here, here. Just.
andy Morning.
erin Hey.
andy Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot. these.
erin Oh.
andy You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
erin Andy, if you're gonna hang out for a while, uh.
andy What's this?
erin This dumb rule robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
andy Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me?
erin No, of course not. It's just – I think it's like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it's like, where does it end? So just.
andy Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? . Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like.
jim all right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
dwight Good, we have a deal?
jim Thanks Janet.
dwight Thanks so much Earl.
jim Wow, simultaneous sale.
dwight And they said it couldn't be done. Boom!
jim Screw ‘em.
andy Lot going on guys. What's happening?
jim Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
andy That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo.
jim Hey, hey, come on, language.
dwight Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
jim In the fridge.
dwight No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
jim Sorry, man, I can't focus on zingers. There's too many potential clients.
stanley You two better watch yourselves.
phyllis Yeah, the Syracuse branch can't be happy you're taking New York clients.
robert Shh. shh.
jim Robert?
oscar Why did Binghamton close?
robert Can everyone just, please. I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and – how should I say this – Columbian whites. What – what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
kevin The branch closed. Forever.
robert Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I'm not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
nellie I got your voicemail. From – from last night.
robert Wonderful.
nellie And the answer. is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never.
robert Pam, when's the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn't hold the memories in?
pam Oh, it was this summer –
robert Apparently, I left a phone message for nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
pam Um, I am a little busy.
robert Yes, ‘course. Why don't you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
pam Yeah, I can make you a list.
robert Let's do it now. What's number one?
pam Why don't I help you now?
robert There we go.
pam Okay.
harry Who the hell are jim Halpert and dwight Schrute?
erin Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
dwight And you are.
harry harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.
harry What the hell's all this?
andy Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
harry You live well down here in P. A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one's that guy?
jim The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
dwight Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
jim Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
dwight Yes.
jim pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.
dwight There he is. That's Lloyd.
toby Me?
creed Yeah, you.
harry Where do you get off crossing state lines?
toby Now, we're actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
toby I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn't back down from anybody. And he calls people "Kimosabe".
harry They're New York. We're New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That's the way it's always been.
jim There's actually not a rule that says that.
dwight That's true.
toby That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
toby No.
dwight Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now.
harry Stay out of my state. It's in your best interest to stay out of my state.
toby I've seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
harry Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.
toby Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that.
jim How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C. E. O should decide this?
harry Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don't think we were doing that.
dwight Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg.
robert Where's the Advil, Jim? I think I've hit my limit on the Tylenol – Oh.
andy Sorry, not Jim.
robert Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send erin back to Florida?
andy Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
robert Oh, for god –
harry robert California. What a surprise you're here in Scranton.
robert Harry.
harry So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
robert How do you mean?
andy I forgot, a. a pan, uh –
harry No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
robert harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems. so poorly timed.
dwight Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
harry Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions –
dwight Don't listen to him.
harry Used to be Binghamton's –
dwight Nope.
harry I want it, it's mine.
dwight Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
harry We need you to make a decision.
dwight Make a decision.
robert I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said.
andy Some bizarre energy in this place today. robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
robert Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I'll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
harry Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? I'm gonna get some air.
dwight Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
jim He's running!
dwight Damn it!
jim Damn it. . push;
dwight Wha – what is this supposed to be?
jim It's a monkey.
dwight Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
jim Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
dwight What?
jim Is that him?
dwight It's him! Do something! Get out!
jim What? What am I gonna do? I don't –
dwight Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay.
jim Dwight!
dwight Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
jim Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
dwight Yeah.
jim Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
dwight Hit the nos.
jim Are you sure?
dwight Yes.
jim Brace yourself. 3. 2.
dwight Got it. Go.
jim 1. Here we go!
andy Hello. andy Bernard to see the C. E. O.
receptionist Oh, do you have an appointment?
andy No, I do not.
receptionist Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.
andy Seriously? ‘Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
receptionist He's really not that busy. Mr.
ramish Is there someone here to see me?
receptionist Yes, this man. Mr.
ramish Come on in.
pam So. what do you make of this robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
nellie Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does.
angela
 Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don't worry, I won't lay an egg.
angela
 robert sent me to take over if pam fails. If?
angela
 I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
gabe Did someone say girl talk?
gabe Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
gabe Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I'm pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
nellie Do you think I'd like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
gabe Uh, I think you're gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. It'll be upsetting if you don't.
andy I'm a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs. Mr.
ramish Why haven't I heard of you? You got any references?
andy No. I'm a rogue. Mr.
ramish Uh-huh.
andy Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now. I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime. Mr.
ramish Every salesman I've ever met has given me his personal phone number.
andy Of course they have. Which is why I'm giving you a key to my house. Whatever you need – anytime, night or day – you just stop on by. Mr.
ramish You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
andy Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe. you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
dwight Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
dwight Ahhh!
jim You all right?
dwight Yeah. Oh.
jim Ah!
jim Dwight, what are you doing?
dwight Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
jim What are you talking about?
dwight Just run! Take the stairs!
jim I don't even know where the stairs are!
dwight I'll stall him. Go!
jim God!
harry What are you doing?
dwight I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. Oh. My pants fell down.
jim What?
dwight My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!
dwight Hello, sir. Good day. dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Mr.
ramish What's going on?
dwight Well –
harry Mr. Ramish, harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse –
dwight I was here first. Mr.
ramish Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
dwight I already made an appointment. with your secretary. Mr.
ramish Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier.
dwight Wait, it's not D. M Utica, is it? Mr.
ramish No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It's. Big Red Paper Company.
jim Big Red Paper Company? Mr.
ramish Mm-hmm.
andy Yes, yes, yes!
harry Give me a cup of coffee.
dwight Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
jim all right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so. we're still on the same team. Let me get these.
dwight No. Let him get his own. It's Syracuse money.
harry You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
dwight jim couldn't land me in a thousand years.
jim But you're saying there's a chance.
dwight Shut up.
pam Hey.
robert Hmm.
pam I stole Nellie's phone.
robert Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
pam What do you want from me?
robert Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's "yes, yes, yes, yes, never. "
phone Hi, Nell, it's mom. Do keep your chin up. It can't be as bad as you described.
robert Oh yes it can.
phone This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
robert Shopaholic.
pam Sounds like it.
robert Yeah.
phone Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?
robert Ah.
phone This is Annie from second nests. I'm sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we're gonna hold out for that.
pam Okay, that's enough.
robert Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
pam No, no, no!
robert No, come on.
pam Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They're all deleted.
robert Pam, Pam, you've completely bungled this!
pam Ah. Ahh.
pam Hey.
nellie Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
pam Um. yes. Definitely. With your hair –
nellie Oh!
pam Certainly. Um. you dropped your cell phone.
nellie Oh, gosh.
pam Yep.
nellie Thank you. I'm. so stupid.
pam No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With robert and everything.
nellie Oh, god, Pam. Don't get me started.
pam No, I will not.
nellie You've just got me started. Robert. is. a filthy beast. I mean, don't you get the feeling, he's just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
pam Well –
nellie I mean, the man talks of nothing but s*x.
pam But sometimes he talks about flesh. and bacchanals.
nellie I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
pam No. don't. Just put it out of your mind.
nellie Pam, what is your address? I'm gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don't –
nellie Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
nellie Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And. I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
robert Erin.
erin There's a call for you on line one.
robert Who is it?
erin He says salvation. No last name.
robert Yeah, hello?
andy You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer.
robert You're blackmailing me.
andy It's just business.
robert Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don't even know my real name. I'm the *bleep* lizard king.
andy Whoa. Well I gave him a chance.
david andy Bernard.
andy You got a minute?
david Um. I'm in the middle of a piano lesson.
andy I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
david Dunder Mifflin. Now. why would I want that? It's worth half of what it was three years ago.
andy Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
david Why don't you come in?
harry So what would you do if you weren't selling paper?
jim Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
dwight What?
jim Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
dwight How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.
harry Nothing?
jim I don't know. I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
harry I'd like to sell one big thing, you know? Like. a plane. One sale, I'm out.
jim That sounds lovely.
harry Anyway, Robert's gonna run this company into the ground, so. We won't be doing this in six months.
