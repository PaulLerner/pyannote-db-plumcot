dwight_schrute I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
dwight_schrute For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and Dwight Schrute trivia.
dwight_schrute I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
dwight_schrute How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
dwight_schrute There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
dwight_schrute I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
andy_bernard Big Turkey.
jim_halpert Is that you singing?
andy_bernard All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
jim_halpert Nice job.
andy_bernard Thank you muchly.
jim_halpert You gonna answer it?
andy_bernard I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
jim_halpert Yikes.
andy_bernard Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
jim_halpert Thank you.
andy_bernard I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future... Andy and the Tuna. Andy and the tuna...
jim_halpert I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
michael_scott Yes, Dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
andy_bernard The cost of doing business.
michael_scott Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
andy_bernard Was the top salesman...
michael_scott I said 'was'.
andy_bernard Addition by subtraction.
michael_scott What does that even mean? That is impossible.
andy_bernard Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
michael_scott But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
oscar_martinez Hey, everyone.
kevin_malone Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
oscar_martinez Oh, that's very funny.
kevin_malone Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
oscar_martinez Hi, Angela.
angela_martin Oscar.
andy_bernard Hey, boss.
michael_scott Hey, what's up.
andy_bernard Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
michael_scott Yep.
andy_bernard Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
michael_scott I don't know. Maybe.
andy_bernard Well, I will take that as a maybe. Where are you going?
michael_scott Bathroom.
andy_bernard Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
andy_bernard Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
angela_martin Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
oscar_martinez The one of all women?
angela_martin Yeah.
oscar_martinez Because I'm gay?
angela_martin No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
oscar_martinez OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
angela_martin Thank you.
kevin_malone Can I join too?
angela_martin Never.
Staples#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode13 Guy You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.
dwight_schrute Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
michael_scott Wow. What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
pam_beesly Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
michael_scott Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
pam_beesly Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
michael_scott Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
andy_bernard Feel ya, dawg.
michael_scott Yeah, do you?
andy_bernard Absolutely.
michael_scott What did I say?
andy_bernard You said...
michael_scott Huh.
andy_bernard Which is like, "Right on." And Pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht." Nailed it.
michael_scott Oh, no.
andy_bernard Oh, no.
michael_scott Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy... just... there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me." I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
oscar_martinez I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
michael_scott No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
oscar_martinez Michael --
michael_scott No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
oscar_martinez Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
michael_scott Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
dwight_schrute Need any help?
kelly_kapoor Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.
dwight_schrute Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
kelly_kapoor Okay.
andy_bernard I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. Whizzzzz. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
jim_halpert Hey.
karen_filippelli Hey.
jim_halpert So Andy is in rare form today.
karen_filippelli Yeah, you should not encourage him.
jim_halpert Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
karen_filippelli Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from Dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
jim_halpert Fine. Party pooper.
michael_scott Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
andy_bernard 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!
jim_halpert Hey, Ryan?
ryan_howard What?
jim_halpert You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
ryan_howard Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
jim_halpert I liked you better when you were the temp.
ryan_howard Yeah, me too.
michael_scott Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
phyllis_vance Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
michael_scott Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
stanley_hudson Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
michael_scott Really?
stanley_hudson No.
michael_scott Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
phyllis_vance No. Sorry.
phyllis_vance Dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
paris Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.
dwight_schrute I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
paris So um, where were you workin' before this?
dwight_schrute Dunder-Mifflin.
paris What kind of company is that?
dwight_schrute Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
paris I never heard of 'em.
dwight_schrute Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
paris You gonna be like that, huh?
paris I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter.
andy_bernard In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
jim_halpert Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
pam_beesly Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
jim_halpert Okay, good. Stay right here.
andy_bernard Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
jim_halpert Are there any messages?
pam_beesly Nope.
jim_halpert So weird.
pam_beesly Hmm.
michael_scott Nice to have Oscar back.
angela_martin Yeah.
andy_bernard Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
jim_halpert No.
andy_bernard Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
pam_beesly Angela?
angela_martin Oh.
pam_beesly Is everything okay?
angela_martin No.
andy_bernard What's going on?
jim_halpert What are you talking about?
andy_bernard Where is my FREAKING phone?!
jim_halpert You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.
andy_bernard Maybe you're in the ceiling!
jim_halpert Okay.
andy_bernard I don't trust you, Phyllis!
angela_martin I wanted to let you know that Dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, Kevin never reminded me.
michael_scott Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
angela_martin Yes.
michael_scott Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
angela_martin None of them. Especially not Andy.
michael_scott Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
andy_bernard Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
michael_scott Um.
andy_bernard Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
michael_scott No. I don't want to do any of that.
andy_bernard Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
michael_scott No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
andy_bernard Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD. That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
pam_beesly Yeah.
andy_bernard Sure? Okay.
dwight_schrute Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
michael_scott Hey.
dwight_schrute Hey.
michael_scott What's up?
dwight_schrute Same old.
michael_scott Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
dwight_schrute Oh my God, she told you?
michael_scott Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
dwight_schrute Accepted.
michael_scott How's this place treating you?
dwight_schrute The boss isn't funny.
michael_scott Oh, well.
dwight_schrute I don't get to wear my ties.
michael_scott No. I'm sure.
dwight_schrute So?
michael_scott So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
dwight_schrute I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
michael_scott We can talk about that. All right.
jim_halpert Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
pam_beesly I think we broke his brain.
jim_halpert "It's not freakin' funny!"
angela_martin Are you enjoying your fiesta?
oscar_martinez Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- it's great.
michael_scott Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
all@ Yay.
angela_martin Welcome back.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
michael_scott Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. Not bad, huh?
dwight_schrute You did this for me?
michael_scott Guilty.
creed_bratton Oh... Where did you get this stuff?
meredith_palmer Gerty's.
creed_bratton Which aisle?
meredith_palmer I don't remember.
creed_bratton Well, draw me a map, mama.
michael_scott Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
pam_beesly No, I will not.
michael_scott So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
oscar_martinez It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
michael_scott Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
jim_halpert Hey.
karen_filippelli Do you still have feelings for her?
jim_halpert Yes.
michael_scott And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?
dwight_schrute Oh, man. No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out!
michael_scott It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
andy_bernard So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.
marcy Oh, hi. You must be Andy.
andy_bernard Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be... Marcy!
marcy That's right, it's so good to meet you.
andy_bernard It's so good to meet you!
marcy Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun?
andy_bernard Yeah.
