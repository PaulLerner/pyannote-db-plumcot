jim I'm taking some time off from work—well, my other work—because we needed it.
pam It's great.
jim It's great.
pam The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
jim But that doesn't matter. This does. It's the only thing that matters. We've had some really nice days together.
pam Nice morning, too.
jim Beesly! Oh, my god.
andy Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial.
jim Ah, definitely blue.
andy Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond?
jim For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin—
andy Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
jim Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can't give 100% to two things at once you know.
andy Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
jim Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing.
oscar Is everything ok?
angela No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
kevin Wait, all of them?
angela Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
oscar That's—that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry.
angela It's the that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
kevin I've never met anyone like that.
angela And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
oscar Angela, you still have your son.
angela I guess.
dwight Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and—
jim Smasher!
dwight Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
dwight I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150, 000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
dwight I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
jim Fireball!
dwight Ah! That's how it's done.
jim That's pretty good. I feel safe. David
wallace Hey, Erin. Is andy in?
erin Oh, is andy in? Sorry, I thought you said "is Indian" and was like, "Is Indian what?" Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
erin Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
erin Yes, there's Andy! andy is in. I'm a good receptionist, I know he's in.
andy David Walrus, in his native habitat. David
wallace Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
andy Yeah. David
wallace This isn't going to be an easy conversation. I told andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, "The kind that's good for head shots. " And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it's gonna boost office morale. Now, he's a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired. David
wallace Andy—
andy I'm gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream. David
wallace Uh-huh, but—
andy Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I'll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense. David
wallace So you think you've been too focused on your job?
andy At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany. David
wallace So you—you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
andy Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don't—it just. I owe it to myself and my future fans. David
wallace Uh, well, I guess I can't stand in the way of a man's dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
andy Thank you, David. David
wallace There's probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
andy Nope. I have made up my mind. I'm really sorry. David
wallace Well, good luck.
andy Thank you. Not gonna need it. David
wallace Okay. David
wallace Well that kind of worked out.
creed I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
jim Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
clark Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I've earned this. I mean, you know?
jim You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here.
clark Right. Well, I'm here to sell paper.
pam Wow.
clark All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And—and wallace is here today. And I don't him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
pam it's okay. You can sit in the annex.
jim What?
pam I'll come visit you.
jim Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk if that's okay with you.
clark That's fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete's beautiful, dead eyes.
andy Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
oscar I can't say we didn't see it coming. But it's a sad day when anybody is fired. We're so sorry, Andy. David
wallace Uh, uh, uh, uh, andy was not fired.
andy I wasn't fired. What are you talking about? I'm fired up, yes. Guys, I'm—I'm leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
pam Oh, Andy.
andy Yeah, so, I'll see you on the red carpet. See, that's how it works.
phyllis andy sings beautifully. And he's really good at dancing. He's a good speaker. But there's just something there you don't want to look at.
jim Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
pete Yeah, a little bit.
jim Oh, wow. But, um—Oh, I get that.
pete Oh, no, no, no. No it's cool.
jim I get it.
pete It's cool, man. I'm sure you and I will have our own thing.
jim Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
darryl I just think you're going into this a little fast.
andy I'm 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
darryl Show business is cold. Let's say you get a job, which you probably won't. They're not gonna cut you any slack. You're meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
andy All right. I get it.
andy The male is a funny species. We don't just tell each other how we feel, that's chick stuff. So instead of saying, "Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don't want you to leave. " You say something like, "Hey, Andy, you're making the worst mistake of your life. You're not talented. " Well. right back at you, Darryl.
andy I'm gonna miss you too. Mmm!
stanley Andy's from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
kevin Could andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird, in the park, that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to cause the park is free!
sensei I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.
dwight He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
sensei It's not a large room, I think they heard me.
dwight Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.
sensei That's really ok. I'm mostly focused on the belt here.
dwight Just slip it off my—Slip it off my hips.
sensei Hold it—Take a step back. Take a step back. Okay, okay. I can't—I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off.
dwight He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
angela dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
dwight There it is.
sensei Congratulations.
dwight We did it, we did it. I love you.
sensei Okay.
dwight Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?
sensei Yes, I will.
dwight Sensei, you're not watching.
sensei Yeah, I'm watching. Just do it.
dwight Watching?
sensei I'm watching.
dwight Watch this part, okay? David
wallace Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
sensei Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world. David
wallace He said that? He's an odd guy, isn't he?
sensei Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he's one of the most tenacious and determined men I've ever met.
esther Oh! I'm am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
jim I really felt like I almost lost her, and—and nothing is worth that. David
wallace Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn't even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
clark Dude, there is no way that jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
dwight You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool.
clark All I'm saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager's chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
dwight Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see jim as manager. David
wallace So, the reason that I called you in here is because andy is moving on.
jim Again. David
wallace Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
jim Not at all. It should be Dwight. David
wallace You sure?
jim You're gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh— David
wallace Yeah.
jim Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person.
nellie Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
andy It's now or never.
nellie Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
andy Yeah, sure. What's your question?
kevin Our question is—it seems dumb.
andy Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
nellie Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and "full-ass" it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
andy Nah. I like my plan better.
kevin Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor.
andy What?
oscar No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
jim Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
pam Yes. Yeah.
jim I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
pam Oh, boy. Um—
jim If you could help me out, that would be—
pam I could give you some beginner stickies?
jim Anything would help.
pam Here you go.
jim Oh, also, while you're at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
pam Mm-hmm.
jim Wow, that's—
pam It's all yours.
jim You come so prepared. Aspirin.
dwight You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
jim Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great.
dwight Thank you. So I saw you talking to wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?
jim No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
dwight Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed.
jim I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.
dwight Hello.
andy Well, hello.
dwight Big day for you.
andy Big day for you.
dwight Thank you.
andy Love the belt.
dwight Oh, yes.
andy You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!
dwight This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
andy Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
dwight Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
andy No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
dwight Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job.
andy Nothing is impossible to him who will try. Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
dwight You're bad.
andy I'm gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
andy Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That's something you can't take back.
erin So true. Is there a question, or are—what?
andy Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
erin Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
andy Thank you. David
wallace You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
andy Thank you. David
wallace Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please? . push;
dwight Say it again. David
wallace Will you be the new manager?
dwight Where? David
wallace Where?
dwight What branch? David
wallace Here. Scranton. Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news.
dwight I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun. David
wallace What?
dwight But this isn't interim manager. No. It's dwight K. Schrute. Manager. David
wallace Why do you already have this?
dwight In case Michael or andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David. David
wallace I know.
dwight I will never, ever let you down. David
wallace I know, Dwight. I know. Okay. Okay. All righty. You're gonna do great.
pam Hey.
jim Wow, hey.
pam Hi.
jim What's up?
pam Um, I have a question.
jim Okay.
pam Oh, I had a question.
jim Really?
pam I did!
jim Yeah, totally you did.
pam Super important.
jim I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
pam Okay.
jim All right? I'm gonna wait.
pam All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
jim I'm sure you did not. What was your question?
pam I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
jim Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I'm waiting.
pam Exactly.
andy Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I'm gonna stay on in sales.
nellie Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
meredith Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don't want to see you in a p0rn next year.
andy Okay.
kevin Ooh, there's a great play about a salesman.
andy Death of a salesman.
kevin I don't think so.
andy Sure, ‘Death of a Salesman' by Arthur Miller, it's a great play about crushed dreams.
kevin No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
andy Got any hot leads?
pete See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
erin I had no idea. And here I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep.
jim Look who's back.
pam I'm back. Oh, hey, look, and now it's like a double date.
pete Wow. Cause, uh
erin Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That'd be fun.
pam Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
erin Well, how about Thursday?
pam Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because of—
jim Weeknights are actually tough just because—
pam They are.
jim That's true, yeah.
erin Just forget it. Forget I said anything. David
wallace Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. dwight Schrute—
dwight David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again? David
wallace I don't think so.
dwight It's just one thing. Just let me—let me do this— David
wallace Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on—what I was about to say was Dwight— Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta—This'll be a second, sorry.
dwight Just wait and send it to voicemail. David
wallace Yeah.
dwight Come on. Come on. David
wallace Then we'll get him a new set of drums.
dwight dwight Schrute is manager!
andy Brava, brava.
creed creed Bratton is the new manager!
pam What's going on?
kevin Dwight's the new manager. He freaking did it.
pam Congratulations, Dwight.
dwight Pam.
jim Congratulations, buddy.
dwight Thank you, Jim.
clark Congrats, Dwight.
dwight Get out of Jim's seat.
clark But I fought for this seat.
dwight You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we'll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
pam It's nice to have you back.
dwight So.
jim So.
dwight I wanted to offer you a new position.
jim Let's hear it.
dwight Assistant regional manager.
jim Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.
dwight Jim.
jim I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.
dwight Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
jim Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
dwight So, all the numbers adding up?
oscar Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but. congratulations, Dwight.
dwight Thank you.
angela Yes. Congratulations.
kevin Yeah, and Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations.
angela This is a big day for you.
dwight Yes, it is. Carry on.
andy How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It's cause I had a fallback. That's the problem. When you have fallbacks, it's just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
andy Everyone! Changed my mind again.
phyllis What's it now, dream or no dream?
andy Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim?
jim Oh, don't look at me cause I think you're making a terrible choice.
andy All in! Whoo!
andy Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
toby Okay, then, Andy.
andy Yeah, but here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
toby Andy, you know I can't do that. It'd be lying.
andy Seriously?
toby Yeah, I'm—
andy Come on, just do it.
toby I can't.
andy All right, fine, just know that you made me do this.
toby Oh, come on. Andy, no.
andy God, Toby, don't—stop blocking my hand.
toby No, no.
andy This is your—you brought this on.
toby No, no. Andy.
andy Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
angela This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem it's clearly on your end. And—oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then. um. what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!
kevin What do you think that was about?
andy David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite. David
wallace We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
andy What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company? David
wallace Enough, Andy. Enough!
andy Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car? David
wallace Oh my god.
andy Eleanor Roosevelt once said ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. ' I think she's right. I feel calm now. I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing.
angela Andy.
andy Yeah.
angela What are you doing?
andy Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top.
angela Yeah, okay. That's not what I mean. You don't have to leave because you said you would. Don't let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It's not worth it.
andy Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too—
angela Ugh.
andy But I just—it's in the past. And I feel like we shouldn't.
angela No, that's not—
andy Rehash—
angela No, none—No, stop. It's just—
andy Exactly.
angela Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
andy Thanks, Angela. You too.
angela Thanks.
andy A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
nellie Oh, good lord.
stanley Can't you just leave?
jim You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
andy Tuna, I'm a performer. And perform I shall.
dwight You okay?
angela It's just a really nice song.
kevin Awesome!
phyllis Who knows? Maybe andy will make it. He's not terrible.
stanley Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
phyllis No, he's good.
stanley He was good.
oscar Good night, Kevin.
kevin Night, Oscar.
oscar Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
angela Well, I've changed my mind.
oscar Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in a—
angela Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
oscar Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
angela Oh, god.
oscar Come stay with me.
angela You don't want me at your place.
oscar I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do.
angela Well.
oscar Separate bathrooms.
angela Thank you.
oscar You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff.
angela Okay.
oscar And get you the hell outta that place.
angela Are you allowed to have pets?
oscar Oh, Angela.
dwight Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
darryl You talk to Wade and Colin?
jim No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?
darryl We got an offer on the table.
jim What kind of offer?
darryl A buyout.
jim What?
darryl We're in play, baby.
jim Oh, my god!
darryl We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it's not just a Philly play, so get
this they're gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
jim Wow, that is. wow.
darryl Yeah, we did it.
jim Yeah, we did. Hey, how long—how long do we think that's gonna take?
darryl Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
jim Oh, man. Yeah, I can't do it.
darryl Can't do what?
jim This, man. I can't do this to Pam.
darryl No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
jim I know. And I can't do it.
angela So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
oscar No, it's neat and tasteful, like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up.
angela I wouldn't know. I never lived with a gay guy.
oscar Angela, you just were—
angela I love him.
oscar I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You—you can't—
angela No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
