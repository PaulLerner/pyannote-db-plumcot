Jim Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Nurse Daddy? She's ready to push.
Jim Okay.
Michael Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.
Jim  Doing great, push again.
Doctor Not yet.
Jim No, don't push. Pull. Pull.
Nurse Why don't you get more ice chips?
Pam No, Jim, stay!
Doctor Okay. Really push this time, Pam.
Pam Okay.
Michael  Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.
Michael That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
Andy Hey, have you guys seen her?
Meredith She hasn't popped yet.
Andy What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.
Andy I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
Phyllis This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.
Michael I think it's going to be any minute now.
Phyllis But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Michael Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
Phyllis I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Michael Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.
Michael  Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
Pam This is happening!
Michael You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
Jim Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God.
Pam Oh, my God.
Michael  Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?
Doctor Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out.
Michael Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
Pam  She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Jim No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Pam Okay.
Michael Guys, guys!
Jim Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Michael Eleven pounds...
Jim She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches. Mother and daughter are doing great.
Everyone Yeah!
Michael Thank you! Thank you!
Oscar Congratulations. That's great.
 Heleen Hi there.
Jim Hey, grandma's back.
Helene Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
Jim Great.
Pam Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
Helene Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.
Jim Oh. Let me get it.
Jim I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.
Michael Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma.
Helene Hello, Michael.
Michael Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.
Helene I'm, uh... You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.
Pam Okay.
Helene Love you.
Michael Love you, as a friend.
Pam Love you, mom.
Michael Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
Pam Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Michael Alright.
Pam Again, no pants.
Michael Oh, okay.
Jim Ready?
Michael Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.
Jim It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Dwight Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work .
Michael There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.
Andy This man has a gift!
Michael Who else here is single?
Kelly I'm not single. I have a man.
Michael I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too.
Stanley Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Michael Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? Who else? Come on! People, I know models!
Ryan Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
Michael Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.
Meredith You know it. I am never getting married.
Meredith Like Clooney.
Michael Andrew, what about you?
Andy Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing.
Andy Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
Michael Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
Pam Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
Jim We were just kids. What did we know?
Nurse How we doing?
Jim Great.
Pam Good.
Nurse Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
Pam Doesn't she sleep here?
Nurse She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot.
Jim I think we'll be okay.
Nurse Okay, great.
Pam  Oh, big yawn.
Jim Ready? One, two, three...
Pam One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down.
Jim I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it.
Pam She's not gonna... Just...
Jim I got it. Alright.
Pam Go.
Jim Nurse!
Jim How you doing?
Pam I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
Jim Really?
Pam Doesn't feel right.
Jim Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
Pam How does one do that?
Jim Wasn't it... It's kinda like a... Like that.
Pam Do you want to try it, Jim?
Jim I think you're good. Doing a good job.
Nurse Somebody buzzed?
Jim Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.
Pam I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.
Nurse Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
Pam Even if she's not getting anything?
Nurse Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.
Pam No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.
Nurse Oh, good. You know everything.
Pam She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Nurse Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
Jim Alright.
Nurse Alright.
Jim It's going to be alright.
Pam Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Jim Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good.
Erin  You wanted to see me?
Michael What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
Erin Oh, boy! ... What's that sound?
Kevin  Ta-da!
Michael I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Kevin Yes!
Erin I don't know what to say.
Kevin Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.
Michael Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?
Kevin Erin, would you have lunch with me?
Erin Okay.
Michael Good!
Kevin Yes!
Erin Michael, could I talk to you privately?
Michael Sure. Kevin, please leave.
Kevin Bye.
Michael Bye.
Erin I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy.
Michael Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
Erin I'm sure he'll be fine.
Michael I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.
Erin Really?
Michael No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him... I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
Erin I don't want anyone to die.
Michael Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.
Kevin Hi.
Erin Hi.
Kevin She touched my shoulder.
Nurse Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.
Jim Oh, hi.
Kathy Hi.
Dale Hi, so sorry.
Jim Careful... Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Pam I know.
Jim You see that? I'm pretty sure she's... Hi.
Erin Did you grow up around here?
Kevin No.
Erin So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Kevin Yes.
Andy Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guy's going to fail this class," or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted." ... Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and... I was jealous.
Hospital employee Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?
Pam Yes?
Hospital employee Hi. I'm Clark. Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
Pam Um, yeah, that would be great.
Jim Yup. Really great. When's she available?
Clark Actually, uh, I'm the consultant. Got milk? Ha ha. Alright, let's see what we're working with.
Pam So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
Clark I'll get that for you.
Pam Oh, thank you. Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing. I don't know if she's getting anything.
Clark Okay. Let me feel here.
Pam Okay.
Clark Yeah, it's quite full. Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
Pam Okay.
Clark When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C. Uh, does that hurt?
Pam No, I mean, it feels... pressure.
Clark Okay.
Jim Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
Pam No. It just feels like pressure.
Clark Okay, well. Feel how I'm flicking the nipple? Like that?
Jim Yup.
Clark Stimulate it.
Jim Yeah.
Clark Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Jim Perfect.
Clark And you can just... The baby should grab on to that.
Jim I think she will.
Pam Okay. So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though. I'm not sure if...
Jim We'll figure it out.
Clark It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.
Pam Okay. Aw, thank you.
Clark Yes, congratulations.
Jim Thank you.
Clark Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?
Pam Okay.
Jim Please do.
Pam Oh, shoot.
Jim What?
Pam Shoot, she fell off.
Jim Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
Pam Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Jim No need. I saw him do it. I can try it.
Pam Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
Jim Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Dwight  Hey, what's up, kid?
Angela Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
Dwight Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Angela I look forward to it.
Dwight Very well.
Angela Goodbye.
Pam  Jim, Jim, get her.
Jim Hmm?
Pam Get the baby. Get her. Come on.
 Jim Okay. Sshh. I know.
Pam I got her. Okay. Okay. Okay... Jim! She latched! She latched.
Jim That's amazing.
Pam Oh, my God. I didn't even have to do the "C thing."
Jim That's awesome.
Pam Aw, we're doing it.
Jim that's great.
Pam We're really parents now.
Jim Mm-hmm.
Michael Kevin. Erin would like a few words with you.
Erin Hey.
Kevin Hi.
Erin I have really enjoyed our time together.
Kevin Yeah, me too.
Erin I want to continue working on our friendship.
Kevin Really, really fun.
Erin Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Kevin Yeah, me too.
Erin And, you're my friend.
Kevin Yeah.
Erin And I hope that I'm your friend... And, maybe...
Kevin Yeah.
Michael Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Kevin You said she liked me.
Michael Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
Kevin I've dumped better than Erin.
Michael No.
Kevin Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Michael Lynn was as hot as Erin.
Kevin Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
Michael This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?
Andy  Ow.
Michael Kev... Nice. Going.
Erin Well...
Isabelle Knock knock.
Pam Oh, hey, Isabelle.
Jim Hey.
Isabelle Hey. Pam, she's gorgeous. Can I hold her?
Pam Yes. She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down. Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her. I don't want her to spit up on you. Come here, sweety... Oh, my God! Wrong baby!
Jim What?
Pam Wrong baby! This is not our baby! Sshh.
Jim Okay, okay.
Pam Oh, my gosh.
Kathy  Oh,has she been fussing long?
Pam No, not at all.
Jim Perfect.
Kathy I was out like a light... Oh, she's not hungry...
Nurse How's it going?
Pam Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Jim Ha ha ha.
Nurse Bottles are fine. A lot of babies grow up using bottles. So are you excited to bring your baby home?
Jim We definitely are. At 3 00, right? You said we could stay until 3 00?
Nurse Yeah, you can. It's 2 35.
Jim Half hour.
Nurse Twenty five minutes. And you're all set with the car seat?
Jim Yes, car seat's right there.
Nurse That bottom part needs to go in the car.
Jim Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Nurse Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.
Jim Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be... Can we get a late checkout? I don't... I don't think she heard me.
Isabelle  Hello? Dwight? What, what are you doing here?
Dwight Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
Isabelle Wow, ha. New cabinets.
Dwight Yup.
Isabelle All I did was bring macaroni and cheese... Where's the fridge?
Dwight Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this.
Isabelle Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it.
Dwight Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun.
Isabelle Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.
Dwight Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha.
Isabelle Yeah...
Dwight Alright. I'll call you, kid.
Isabelle Do that.
Jim Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Hospital employee Yeah.
Jim But you hear the baby crying, right?
Hospital employee Mm-hmm... Where's your car?
Jim Uh, it's in the lot.
Hospital employee Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.
Jim Right, okay. Yes, that would be the smart thing to do. Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Pam Okay, please hurry.
Andy Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately. It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
Erin Okay, good.
Andy The fax says "Erin, will you have dinner with me?" from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
Erin It's busy. Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Andy Sorry, that's unacceptable. I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
Erin  You can't talk to me like that. I didn't do anything wrong. I've been having a tough day today.
Andy Oh, God, no. I'm... Just read the fax.
Erin You read the fax.
Andy I'm... I'm asking you out.
Erin Oh, my God. That's amazing. Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Andy So, it's a date.
Erin Yes. Do you have a day in mind?
Andy Yeah, what day? What day?
Erin Everyday is fine. Or...
Andy Well, that, what's that one?
Erin Thursday?
Andy Okay. Let's do it.
Erin Okay.
Hospital employee Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?
Pam Oh, yeah, sorry.
Hospital employee Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.
Pam Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.
Jim Five tickets on the windshield... Hey.
Pam Hi. We did it.
Jim You used my move, didn't you?
Pam I used a variation of your move.
Michael  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick...
Dwight Two forms of ID, please.
Angela And now you, two forms of ID, please... Alright, all is in order. I just need your signature... What is it?
Dwight Nothing.
Angela Alright. How would you like to celebrate?
Dwight Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.
