gabe_lewis Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
dwight_schrute Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? Mwah.
gabe_lewis I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They'd flex them all night at the discotheque.
dwight_schrute Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh?
gabe_lewis Yeah.
dwight_schrute Oh, please.
gabe_lewis Core's critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One – lengthen. Two – elongate.
jim_halpert Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that – flat curl contest.
jim_halpert All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
dwight_schrute Feast on this, Lewis.
gabe_lewis I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
jim_halpert Come on, Gabe, you can't handle his hamstrings. You're getting hypno-thigh-zed.
gabe_lewis Speed set. One. Two.
jim_halpert Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
dwight_schrute Oh, thank you.
jim_halpert You're welcome.
gabe_lewis Five. Six.
jim_halpert Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
all@ Eight, nine, ten.
gabe_lewis We got it?
dwight_schrute Very funny Jim.
gabe_lewis Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
robert_california Everyone, conference room, now.
jim_halpert All right, easy there, grandpa.
dwight_schrute I don't need your help.
jim_halpert Okay. You don't need my help?
dwight_schrute Here, here... Just...
andy_bernard Morning.
erin_hannon Hey.
andy_bernard Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot... these.
erin_hannon Oh.
andy_bernard You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
erin_hannon Andy, if you're gonna hang out for a while, uh...
andy_bernard What's this?
erin_hannon This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
andy_bernard Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me?
erin_hannon No, of course not. It's just – I think it's like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it's like, where does it end? So just...
andy_bernard Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? ...Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like.
jim_halpert All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
dwight_schrute Good, we have a deal?
jim_halpert Thanks Janet.
dwight_schrute Thanks so much Earl.
jim_halpert Wow, simultaneous sale.
dwight_schrute And they said it couldn't be done. Boom!
jim_halpert Screw ‘em.
andy_bernard Lot going on guys. What's happening?
jim_halpert Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
andy_bernard That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo.
jim_halpert Hey, hey, come on, language.
dwight_schrute Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
jim_halpert In the fridge.
dwight_schrute No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
jim_halpert Sorry, man, I can't focus on zingers. There's too many potential clients.
stanley_hudson You two better watch yourselves.
phyllis_vance Yeah, the Syracuse branch can't be happy you're taking New York clients.
robert_california Shh... shh...
jim_halpert Robert?
oscar_martinez Why did Binghamton close?
robert_california Can everyone just, please... I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and – how should I say this – Columbian whites. What – what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
kevin_malone The branch closed. Forever.
robert_california Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I'm not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
nellie_bertram I got your voicemail. From – from last night.
robert_california Wonderful.
nellie_bertram And the answer... is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never.
robert_california Pam, when's the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn't hold the memories in?
pam_beesly Oh, it was this summer –
robert_california Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
pam_beesly Um, I am a little busy.
robert_california Yes, ‘course. Why don't you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
pam_beesly Yeah, I can make you a list.
robert_california Let's do it now. What's number one?
pam_beesly Why don't I help you now?
robert_california There we go.
pam_beesly Okay.
harry_jannerone Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
erin_hannon Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
dwight_schrute And you are...
harry_jannerone Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.
harry_jannerone What the hell's all this?
andy_bernard Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
harry_jannerone You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one's that guy?
jim_halpert The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
dwight_schrute Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to – how do I put this – steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
jim_halpert Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
dwight_schrute Yes.
jim_halpert Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.
dwight_schrute There he is. That's Lloyd.
toby_flenderson Me?
creed_bratton Yeah, you.
harry_jannerone Where do you get off crossing state lines?
toby_flenderson Now, we're actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
toby_flenderson I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn't back down from anybody. And he calls people "Kimosabe".
harry_jannerone They're New York. We're New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That's the way it's always been.
jim_halpert There's actually not a rule that says that.
dwight_schrute That's true.
toby_flenderson That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
toby_flenderson No.
dwight_schrute Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now.
harry_jannerone Stay out of my state. It's in your best interest to stay out of my state.
toby_flenderson I've seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
harry_jannerone Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.
toby_flenderson Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that.
jim_halpert How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
harry_jannerone Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don't think we were doing that.
dwight_schrute Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg.
robert_california Where's the Advil, Jim? I think I've hit my limit on the Tylenol – Oh.
andy_bernard Sorry, not Jim.
robert_california Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
andy_bernard Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
robert_california Oh, for god –
harry_jannerone Robert California. What a surprise you're here in Scranton.
robert_california Harry...
harry_jannerone So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
robert_california How do you mean?
andy_bernard I forgot, a... a pan, uh –
harry_jannerone No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
robert_california Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems... so poorly timed.
dwight_schrute Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
harry_jannerone Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions –
dwight_schrute Don't listen to him.
harry_jannerone Used to be Binghamton's –
dwight_schrute Nope.
harry_jannerone I want it, it's mine.
dwight_schrute Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
harry_jannerone We need you to make a decision.
dwight_schrute Make a decision.
robert_california I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said...
andy_bernard Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
robert_california Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I'll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
harry_jannerone Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? I'm gonna get some air.
dwight_schrute Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
jim_halpert He's running!
dwight_schrute Damn it!
jim_halpert Damn it.
dwight_schrute Wha – what is this supposed to be?
jim_halpert It's a monkey.
dwight_schrute Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
jim_halpert Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert Is that him?
dwight_schrute It's him! Do something! Get out!
jim_halpert What? What am I gonna do? I don't –
dwight_schrute Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay.
jim_halpert Dwight!
dwight_schrute Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
jim_halpert Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
dwight_schrute Hit the nos.
jim_halpert Are you sure?
dwight_schrute Yes.
jim_halpert Brace yourself. 3... 2...
dwight_schrute Got it. Go.
jim_halpert 1. Here we go!
andy_bernard Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
receptionist Oh, do you have an appointment?
andy_bernard No, I do not.
receptionist Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.
andy_bernard Seriously? ‘Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
receptionist He's really not that busy.
mr_ramish Ramish Is there someone here to see me?
receptionist Yes, this man.
mr_ramish Ramish Come on in.
pam_beesly So...what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
nellie_bertram Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does.
angela_martin Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don't worry, I won't lay an egg.
angela_martin Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If?
angela_martin I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
gabe_lewis Did someone say girl talk?
gabe_lewis Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
gabe_lewis Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I'm pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
nellie_bertram Do you think I'd like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
gabe_lewis Uh, I think you're gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. It'll be upsetting if you don't.
andy_bernard I'm a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
mr_ramish Ramish Why haven't I heard of you? You got any references?
andy_bernard No. I'm a rogue.
mr_ramish Ramish Uh-huh.
andy_bernard Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now... I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
mr_ramish Ramish Every salesman I've ever met has given me his personal phone number.
andy_bernard Of course they have. Which is why I'm giving you a key to my house. Whatever you need – anytime, night or day – you just stop on by.
mr_ramish Ramish You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
andy_bernard Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
dwight_schrute Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
dwight_schrute Ahhh!
jim_halpert You all right?
dwight_schrute Yeah. Oh.
jim_halpert Ah!
jim_halpert Dwight, what are you doing?
dwight_schrute Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
jim_halpert What are you talking about?
dwight_schrute Just run! Take the stairs!
jim_halpert I don't even know where the stairs are!
dwight_schrute I'll stall him. Go!
jim_halpert God!
harry_jannerone What are you doing?
dwight_schrute I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. Oh. My pants fell down.
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!
dwight_schrute Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
mr_ramish Ramish What's going on?
dwight_schrute Well –
harry_jannerone Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse –
dwight_schrute I was here first.
mr_ramish Ramish Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
dwight_schrute I already made an appointment... with your secretary.
mr_ramish Ramish Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier.
dwight_schrute Wait, it's not D.M Utica, is it?
mr_ramish Ramish No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It's... Big Red Paper Company.
jim_halpert Big Red Paper Company?
mr_ramish Ramish Mm-hmm.
andy_bernard Yes, yes, yes!
harry_jannerone Give me a cup of coffee.
dwight_schrute Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
jim_halpert All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so... we're still on the same team. Let me get these.
dwight_schrute No. Let him get his own. It's Syracuse money.
harry_jannerone You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
dwight_schrute Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years.
jim_halpert But you're saying there's a chance.
dwight_schrute Shut up.
pam_beesly Hey.
robert_california Hmm.
pam_beesly I stole Nellie's phone.
robert_california Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
pam_beesly What do you want from me?
robert_california Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's "yes, yes, yes, yes, never."
harry_jannerone Hi, Nell, it's mom. Do keep your chin up. It can't be as bad as you described.
robert_california Oh yes it can.
harry_jannerone This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
robert_california Shopaholic.
pam_beesly Sounds like it.
robert_california Yeah.
harry_jannerone Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?
robert_california Ah.
harry_jannerone This is Annie from second nests. I'm sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we're gonna hold out for that.
pam_beesly Okay, that's enough.
robert_california Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
pam_beesly No, no, no!
robert_california No, come on.
pam_beesly Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They're all deleted.
robert_california Pam, Pam, you've completely bungled this!
pam_beesly Ah. Ahh.
pam_beesly Hey.
nellie_bertram Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
pam_beesly Um... yes. Definitely. With your hair –
nellie_bertram Oh!
pam_beesly Certainly. Um... you dropped your cell phone.
nellie_bertram Oh, gosh.
pam_beesly Yep.
nellie_bertram Thank you. I'm... so stupid.
pam_beesly No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
nellie_bertram Oh, god, Pam. Don't get me started.
pam_beesly No, I will not.
nellie_bertram You've just got me started. Robert... is... a filthy beast. I mean, don't you get the feeling, he's just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
pam_beesly Well –
nellie_bertram I mean, the man talks of nothing but s*x.
pam_beesly But sometimes he talks about flesh... and bacchanals.
nellie_bertram I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
pam_beesly No... don't. Just put it out of your mind.
nellie_bertram Pam, what is your address? I'm gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don't –
nellie_bertram Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
nellie_bertram Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And... I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
robert_california Erin.
erin_hannon There's a call for you on line one.
robert_california Who is it?
erin_hannon He says salvation. No last name.
robert_california Yeah, hello?
andy_bernard You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer.
robert_california You're blackmailing me.
andy_bernard It's just business.
robert_california Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don't even know my real name. I'm the *bleep* lizard king.
andy_bernard Whoa. Well I gave him a chance.
david_wallace Andy Bernard.
andy_bernard You got a minute?
david_wallace Um... I'm in the middle of a piano lesson.
andy_bernard I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
david_wallace Dunder Mifflin. Now... why would I want that? It's worth half of what it was three years ago.
andy_bernard Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
david_wallace Why don't you come in?
harry_jannerone So what would you do if you weren't selling paper?
jim_halpert Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
dwight_schrute How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.
harry_jannerone Nothing?
jim_halpert I don't know. I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
harry_jannerone I'd like to sell one big thing, you know? Like... a plane. One sale, I'm out.
jim_halpert That sounds lovely.
harry_jannerone Anyway, Robert's gonna run this company into the ground, so... We won't be doing this in six months.
