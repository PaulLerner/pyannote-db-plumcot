pam Hey.
jim Hey.
pam I gotcha one.
jim Oh wow, thank you.
pam Yeah.
jim I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
pam No. Thanks. uh we're still having lunch today, right?
jim I guess. How dare you.
michael Hey Toby. What's this?
toby Ohh.
michael I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
toby Yes, uh some people in the office have complained.
michael Oh really.
toby . about some other people engaging in PDA and, you know I just wanted to remind it's not appropriate to, to do that.
michael Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight.
toby Ok, look the memo is not about you.
angela For the record, I have never been involved with anyone at work, in any capacity.
toby Alright everyone, look, it, alright my complaint was about jim and Pam. So.
michael No way.
dwight What?
phyllis You guys are together?
jim Ummm. yup. Yes, we are.
michael Woooah! Wow!
andy Tuna!
michael Awesome!
kevin I knew it!
michael You guys! Yes! Yes!
pam Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?
toby Yes.
michael Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, stand up. OK, here we go. Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that jim and pam become one.
jim Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
michael I love you guys, so much.
jim Ohh.
pam Phone's ringing.
michael No, no, no pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
dwight I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
angela It's not a surprise to me. pam is the office mattress.
andy jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
michael Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.
phyllis Did you plan it?
michael No.
pam Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
michael Blowing up balloons I thought.
pam You might want to trim it a little.
phyllis Michael.
kelly Oh, is. ryan coming back today?
pam Yeah, he is.
kelly Oh.
michael pam and jim are together. ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.
angela What do you want?
dwight To give you this .
angela Oh, what is that?
dwight It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
angela Her name was Sprinkles.
dwight And his name is. Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. Don't you Garbage?
angela I can't believe you just thought you could replace Sprinkles. Before she's even in the ground.
dwight You haven't buried her yet?
angela Don't rush me. I'm grieving.
dwight Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. Look at him.
angela I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!
pam Hey Toby.
toby Hey. you two.
jim Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
toby Oh well, you know, those were only for, you know relationships, so. if, if this is just a casual thing, there's no need, really.
jim Oh.
pam Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official.
toby Uh huh.
jim Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or. ?
toby Let's just wait and see what happens. You know?
jim What?
toby Let's just wait.
jim Oh, OK.
pam OK.
jim Great.
pam Hey Ryan. Welcome back --
ryan Hold on one second. Hey Pam! It's great to see you. Is michael in?
michael Hey!
pam Yeah.
michael There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. He. He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
ryan OK. Should we get started?
michael Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm.
ryan Yep, exactly. This is a business meeting.
michael . business meeting --
kevin Fire!
ryan Stop that! Stop that!
michael That's right! That's right!
ryan You scared me.
michael Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
andy Fire guy
kevin You weren't here for that.
andy Here for what?
kevin When he started the fire.
michael Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man.
kevin Little old man boy.
ryan michael and everybody, umm.
michael Beard.
kevin Bearded man boy.
ryan . let me just say something. I know I used to be a temp here, but now everything is different. I'd like your respect. I am your boss now. You're gonna have to treat me that same way you treated Jan.
michael Oh, wow!
ryan So.
michael That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
ryan OK.
michael Woooo! I think ryan has a gay crush on me.
ryan Enough! OK? This is inappropriate and it stops right now. Do you understand?
michael Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in 10 minutes?
ryan Perfect.
michael Sounds good. OK, alright.
michael Yeah, ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, "Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you. " His words.
ryan dunder Mifflin Infinity represents a floor to ceiling streamlining of our business model. The center piece of the campaign is a new business-to-business website interface that will allow us to compete directly with big box chains.
jim Wait a second. Last time I checked, dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it.
ryan This is a massive overhaul. We're getting younger. Sleeker. And more agile so that we adapt to the market place. All essential personnel will be issued Blackberries for company use.
michael OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
ryan I'll stick around to help you set them up afterwards. Any questions? Dwight?
dwight What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
ryan This is company-wide, Dwight.
dwight Got it.
ryan Andy.
andy We should call it dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?
ryan Any other questions? kelly Kapoor.
kelly Can we speak privately about our relationship?
ryan Thank you everybody.
michael ryan Howard everybody. Good job.
creed That's some fun stuff. When does the website go up?
ryan As fast as possible. We want to start retraining people A. S. A. P, so we can hit the ground running with a new system.
creed Cool beans.
creed We're screwed.
michael Who is?
creed Us? You and me. The old timers.
michael I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
creed You're over 40, that's the cut off. Are you listening to what he's saying? Re-training. New system. Youth. I'm telling you this kid is the grim reaper. You deal with this or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with the car, we're goners.
jim Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, dwight and angela dating. Have been for six months.
pam No.
jim Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
pam No, they have been dating for like two years. Since before your barbeque.
jim Wait. What? You knew? And you didn't say anything?
pam You didn't say anything to me?
jim Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
pam Can you believe that.
phyllis Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here.
jim Oh no, we're just sitting here.
phyllis I couldn't see your hands. Hey Pam, by the way, it's great that you're dating. But when a new client calls, you just have to randomly assign them to a sales person. You can't base who gets new clients on who you're sleeping with that week, OK?
pam OK.
phyllis OK.
jim OK.
jim And. that is why we waited so long to tell people.
ryan OK, what's up?
michael Yeah, kay. I was just. After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
ryan Well it is business, but not as usual.
michael Yeah, I know I understand. we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
ryan No. We're throwing out the entire playbook, we're starting from scratch, we're implementing a brand new system.
michael Good, so, we're on the same page?
ryan No. We're not. Michael, I know exactly how much time and man power are wasted in this branch. This company is getting younger, faster, more efficient. You need to prepare yourself.
michael We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.
ryan So, how are you?
kelly Awesome. I am dating a lot of guys.
ryan Good.
kelly A lot. Black guys mostly.
ryan Kelly.
kelly What?!
phyllis Wait, uh, how do you touch just one of these buttons at a time?
stanley I don't know.
phyllis Did you even try?
stanley If the kid wants to set mine up, I'll let him.
phyllis I can't see half of the things.
stanley It's too little. Use the phone.
kelly I want you to tell me that you care about me. That is what I want.
ryan Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
kelly Oh big strong man, fancy new whatever. I don't think you ever cared about me.
ryan I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
kelly Well, I hope you're still committed because I'm pregnant.
kelly 
kelly And guess what buddy, I am keeping it.
ryan OK. OK.
kelly Do you feel prepared to help me raise a baby?
ryan I can. I can't talk about this right now, OK? After work, we'll go out to dinner, we'll talk about it then, OK?
kelly We have a date!
dwight Hello.
angela Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
dwight Really?
angela Yes.
dwight I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
angela I would prefer a public place. See you after work.
jan Hi, Pam.
pam Hi.
jan Is michael in?
pam In his office. You can go right in.
jan Hey.
ryan Jan.
jan Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.
ryan So elephant in the room, I have your old job.
jan Well, not exactly my job. I had a different title.
ryan Oh well, excuse me, same office, same responsibilities.
jan Different salary. You'll get there, don't worry.
ryan Well. you look great.
jan Thank you, thank you.
ryan Scranton suits you.
jan Best decision I ever made.
ryan You were let go.
jan You know what? I love the beard. Keep it forever.
michael Hey.
jan Hey.
michael Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
jan What?
michael I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
jan So, what's ryan doing here?
michael Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
jan He's such a snake.
michael Well.
jan I hope he's gets hit with an ageism suit.
michael What is that. word?
jan Ageism? Companies they can't discriminate against people due to old age. Like a couple years ago we tried to force out some of the older branch managers with a mandatory retirement age and then Ed Truck, your old boss, threatened us with a lawsuit, so we had to back off.
michael So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
jan Yes, Michael, they do.
oscar Creed?
creed Yes, sir.
oscar Everything OK?
creed Everything's cool, dude.
creed I'm thirty. Well, in November I'll be thirty.
ryan Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
pam michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.
ryan Ohh. man.
michael Good, we're all here, we can get started.
ryan Michael.
michael Have a seat.
ryan We're not doing this today.
michael Have a seat. Like everybody else.
ryan OK. This is.
michael Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also. illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
toby Technically, he's right.
michael Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
creed Because they're lame.
michael No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" Yeah.
jim Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
pam Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.
michael I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
pam Oh. Robert
dunder michael Scott?
michael That is me. Come on in. Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?
dwight Oh, yeah. Yes! Robert
dunder Thank you everyone.
ryan Michael, can I talk to you a second?
michael Sure thing. 'Scuse me.
ryan We have actual work to do.
michael Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
michael Bob, how old are you? Robert
dunder I'm 87.
michael Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of dunder Mifflin? Robert
dunder Well, I, I, I haven't been to a board meeting in years. I, I send a proxy.
michael Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
dwight I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation. Robert
dunder I started this company in 1949.
michael Wow. Robert
dunder Back then, it was an uh, an industrial supplier of metal brackets mostly for, for construction.
michael Oh, boy. Robert
dunder And then Mifflin, of course he killed himself later. Uh, but I knew Mifflin through the Rotary Club.
michael Great. Robert
dunder And he was, he was at dinner with Beverly and her husband, wha-what was his name, umm. uhh. Jerry. Jerry Trupiano from, from South Jersey and he was tall. Both he and Mifflin were tall guys.
michael Great. Robert
dunder And.
michael That's great. Thank you for coming in. Robert dunder everybody. Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride? Robert
dunder Well I, I, I came here in a cab.
michael Perfect. Robert
dunder Well, cou, could you get me another.
michael Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail.
pam I think that I should help him get home.
michael No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. What a nice guy. . push;
michael Good night guys.
ryan Well, today was a fantastic waste of time.
michael I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
ryan Michael, technology helps business OK? You should not resist it, this is the way the world is moving.
michael I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
ryan Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. Where do you wanna go?
kelly You know, some place romantic and expensive.
ryan Kelly, come on.
kelly You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it.
dwight Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
angela Very much. How's your meat?
dwight Dry. Delicious.
angela I heard a joke today.
dwight Oh, that's funny.
angela Yes, it was.
dwight Are you enjoying your mineral water?
angela I can't do this. I can't be with you. Every time I look in your eyes I see Sprinkles' stiff lifeless body.
dwight Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here , it's an old sales trick.
angela I'm sorry. I gave this everything I could.
dwight No, please don't do this, monkey.
angela I will leave your toothbrush on top of your tire tomorrow morning.
toby Hey guys. This is my, uh, girlfriend, Amy.
pam Hi.
jim Hey, Amy. How ya doing?
pam Nice to meet you.
jim Nice to meet you.
toby This is everybody else. okay. This is the place. so thanks for the lift.
amy Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll see you tonight, right?
toby Absolutely.
amy Whoa. Easy tiger.
toby I just really like you.
amy Okay. Bye guys. Nice to meet you.
toby Have a great day!
pam Whoa, Toby. Watch out. You're going to violate your own PDA memo.
toby I wouldn't want to do that now would I?
michael Smell that. Do you smell that?
dwight Dry rot?
michael No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
andy Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.
michael Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
michael ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.
dwight Excuse me, Angela. michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
angela Thank you.
dwight You're welcome.
angela Is that all?
dwight Yes. I miss you.
angela Elevators.
angela Dwight, you have to listen to me! We are not seeing each other anymore! Can you accept that?
dwight Fine. Then I just want to be friends.
angela Good.
dwight Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
angela 
kelly I don't understand what the big deal is.
ryan You don't?
kelly No!
ryan You lied about being pregnant.
kelly Right, so?
ryan You really don't understand why that might make me kind of angry?
kelly No!
ryan We're never getting back together.
kelly Why not?
jim Hey.
pam Hey.
jim Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
pam It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.
jim I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
pam I think. I mean, I don't know what it is but.
jim Be honest.
pam I now find you repulsive.
jim That's honest. Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
pam Eh.
jim For me, it was.
pam OK.
jim Alright.
michael Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.
ryan What's, uh, going on here?
michael I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
ryan With gift baskets.
michael With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.
michael Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. "You can't be on the team", "You can't move on to second grade". Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.
michael OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.
stanley I'm not driving with him.
andy I'll go with you Stanley.
stanley Or him.
jim Why don't we just go by ourselves?
michael Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
phyllis Michael.
michael Yes?
phyllis This is stupid.
michael OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
phyllis How is giving people gift baskets going to get our clients back?
michael Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are. the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
andy What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so. it's kind of the best gift ever.
jim What about a gift basket full of cash?
andy Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.
michael Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
dwight Michael, wait. Let me go.
michael No, this is my quest.
dwight Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. Please.
michael Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
ryan Good luck Michael.
michael We don't need luck.
dwight Yeah.
michael But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
dwight Thank you.
michael Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.
ryan Yes, I understand that David. I just felt that if we were to downsize kelly and then outsource customer service to India which a lot of companies. Yeah, no, yes kelly is Indian. I understand that's confusing.
creed Hey brah, I've been meaning to ask you, can we get some Red Bull for these things? Sometimes a guy's gotta ride the bull, am I right? Later skater.
dwight Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
michael It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
dwight Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
michael I know. So who's next?
dwight Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
gps Proceed to the highlighted route, then route guidence will begin.
dwight Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
michael Who?
dwight The government, spy satellites, private detectives. exgirlfriends.
ryan Next night, I'm out, at a bar, 2 AM, I figure I'll get a sandwich because you can get a sandwich any time of the night. I run into Vince Vaughn.
kevin No way!
ryan Literally.
andy Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.
ryan . Later guys.
kevin Yeah, later dude.
andy Later man.
kevin Oh, Jim! How awesome is ryan now?
jim Yeah, he's definitely something.
kevin What does that mean?
jim That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
andy Ha! Tuna. Tuna Tuna Tuna.
kevin Tuna Tuna Tuna.
andy He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.
kevin And he can get any girl that he wants.
andy So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome. then. you need awesome lessons.
kevin Tuna. Check you later.
michael Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps? Larry
myers You know we closed our account with you right?
michael Yes we do. Larry
myers We're with Office Depot now.
dwight Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
michael Well.
dwight And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
michael Mmhmm. Larry
myers OK. I don't think we're coming back.
dwight Please, come back.
michael OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
dwight Remember what we had Larry? Larry
myers I mean, really it's about money.
michael Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket. Larry
myers OK thanks.
michael Alright. Larry
myers I mean their website is really easy to use too. That's a big deal for us.
michael That guy was so. how can they not know how much better we are?
dwight I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
michael That is true.
dwight Like angela in accounting.
michael Yes, she is nuts.
dwight Ugh. no, she's wonderful. at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
gps Make the next right turn.
michael How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
ryan Hey Pam. I haven't settled on our final design logo yet for dunder Mifflin Infinity and I know you're into graphic design. Do you want to give it a shot? Maybe try and deisgn the logo?
pam Uh totally.
ryan Cool, that would be great. Um, can you do a couple mock ups and I'll take a look?
pam Yeah.
ryan Thank you very much.
pam Thank you.
ryan Cool.
pam OK.
pam Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some. splash frames. I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.
michael And the last guy says "No, hairy body". Ex-
client You know I have heard it before.
michael Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke. your daughter Emily. How's she doing? Ex-
client She's great, thanks for asking. Great memory.
michael She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider. Ex-
client Oh, OK.
michael OK, OK! So you'll reconsider? Ex-
client OK thanks for the goodies.
michael Ah. . is that all you have to say? Ex-
client It looks delicious? I don't know.
dwight You don't know?
michael Look, we want you back. Ex-
client Can you offer lower prices?
michael Well, no. Ex-
client Then we're not coming back.
dwight He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
michael No it's not. Ex-
client No he's right.
dwight Accept it, why would he come back?
michael Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
dwight That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
michael Look. we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier. Ex-
client Oh, OK. Well when it's up, I'll check it out, and if it really cuts costs maybe we'll come back.
michael Great, the magic of the gift basket. Ex-
client That I don't care about as much. Let me know when the site's up.
michael OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
gps Proceed straight.
dwight Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
michael I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
dwight That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
michael That is a very good point, Dwight.
gps Make a right turn.
dwight Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
michael No, it said right, it said take a right.
dwight No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
michael Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
dwight It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
michael The machine knows where it is going!
dwight This is the lake!
michael The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!

dwight Fine.
michael Good, that is what's most important.
dwight Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
michael What a disaster, this whole thing.
dwight I'll call a cab.
michael These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
dwight Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
michael What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
dwight Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
michael Hang up. You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
dwight Yes!
michael We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
dwight Take a stand!
pam So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.
ryan I like it a lot. It's clear and subtle at the same time. It's really good, you have a real talent for this stuff.

client Did you forget something? What happened to you guys?
michael Give it back. The gift basket, give it back. Ex-

dwight It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket. Ex-
client Maybe you should leave.
michael Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!

client I ate them OK, I ate the turtles, they're gone!
dwight We'll bill you.
michael May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.
ryan That is not correct.
michael ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
oscar You did what?
michael I drove my car into a lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
jim Into a lake.
michael Exactly!
phyllis Did you get any clients back?
michael Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. Game set match. point. Scott. game over. end of game.
michael Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
ryan I'm not saying I had a meteoric rise. but I did. And if they knew how much I was paying for my haircut now, they wouldn't be giving me a noogie. . It was two hundred dollars.
ryan You should come visit. The city is. amazing.
jim I know. I love it there.
ryan No. You don't know until you live there. There's something about waking up every morning and just being in that city.
jim Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
ryan No. You can't imagine it, though. The energy when you're actually there. You're just part of something bigger than you, that's moving faster than you. Your dreams are. . it just. everything feels so limitless.
jim Sounds great.
ryan No. It. eh. you can't. it's not about how it sounds.
jim Yeee.
