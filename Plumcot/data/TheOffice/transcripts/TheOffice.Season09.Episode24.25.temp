dwight The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew? Camera
man We're getting bonus footage for the DVD.
dwight pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore. Camera
man It'll be a pledge gift.
dwight PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
dwight In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a "where are they now" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. I haven't seen kevin since we let him go.
dwight Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
kevin Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
stanley Ah, I've been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
meredith Speech!
dwight No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is. for. Kevin.
kevin Yes! Wait, why?
dwight Go ahead and just read the frosting.
kevin "Get out. "
dwight Uh-huh.
kevin What does that mean?
dwight It's a colloquial way of saying "you're fired, " Kevin, which you are.
pam What? Dwight, you can't do that.
dwight The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
all What?!
dwight Well if anyone here can make a case for kevin staying.
all Dwight.
dwight Based. on his merit.
oscar Ooh.
jim Umm. .
kevin I'm. good.
pam Well, toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so.
toby Yeah. Yeah, I don't think.
dwight Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. Bye, bye Toby.
kevin At least I got chocolate.
jim I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too.
jim pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
crowd Whoo! Yeah
jim Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
jim And dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
pam Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
angela Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. Look at Meredith. She's disgusting. Those feet. They're like the paws of an orangutan.
pam I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much.
dwight That is all. Have a good morning.
meredith Thank you.
dwight What was that for?
angela To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful.
dwight Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
angela D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
dwight Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him.
angela I don't. I don't know why.
dwight I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, creed was in the band "The Grass Roots" in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
phyllis Oh, some fudge?
malcolm Oh, thanks. I love your fudge.
phyllis Thanks.
malcolm I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
phyllis Oh, you can afford it.
phyllis After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But. he'll get there.
jim Okay, the limo's gonna be here at five. I need everybody to be ready ‘cause I want to pack in a lot.
zeke Party time! Whorehouse!
jim Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?
zeke Well, you're the bestisch mensch.
jim dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight. only good surprises. "Guten Pranken".
dwight Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight.
clark Great, now we got three hours to fill.
jim Okay, hold on. Are you sure mose isn't going to show up?
dwight Ever since angela moved in and mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
jim mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.
andy Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say Casey
dean You can't just sit here and cry.
andy Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
andy Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it. Bill
hader Seth
mayers Oh, Don't. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don't be such a baby. Bill
hader Seth
mayers Oh, No. It's gonna be alright. Bill
hader Seth
mayers It's gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I'm Seth Meyers. That's Baby Wawa. Good night. Bill
hader Bye!
andy After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. Not really my scene.
oscar Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you. hold on.
dakota Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's. it's all over the place. I don't know what it means.
oscar That's the reason kevin got fired. It's his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, "A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven. " He was home by 4
 45 that day.
nellie Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E. U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
toby Hello! Hello!
nellie Oh.
toby Hi!
nellie No.
toby Oh.
nellie How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
toby Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
nellie No. And I thought I unfriended you.
toby Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
toby [alone in cab} After dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ‘cause they have to give you one month's notice before they leave.
andy Hey-OH!
meredith Andy?
oscar You're back?
andy Yeah.
malcolm That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!
jim Hey man, good to see you.
andy Thank you. Yeah,
phyllis . Andy.
andy Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
phyllis Andy, I've been worried about you. How are you?
andy A little warm.
phyllis Poor, poor Andy.
andy Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
darryl Hello, hello.
jim Hey!
meredith Darryl!
andy Hey!
darryl Hey, what's up?
andy Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
darryl What? Must've been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
andy Hmm.
darryl Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um. I didn't call ‘cause I figured you changed the number.
andy No I didn't change the number. all good though. Phone never rings.
dwight What? Ooh!
andy Surprise!
dwight I thought you guys couldn't come.
darryl Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
jim Kismet? Yeah, right. pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? "Guten Prank" number one.
darryl You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
dwight Uh, better ask Jim.
jim And jim will say nothing.
pam Darryl! Andy!
andy Hey! Pam!
darryl Hey, Pam! How are you?
pam We're fine. Yeah. And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn't you be?
andy Mm-hmm.
pam Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
darryl I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
jim Yeah?
darryl Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are. for real.
jim Wow! That sounds incredible. . Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to.
oscar Whoo, whoo, whoo.
pam Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
oscar Yeah!
andy Aw!
darryl Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever.
oscar They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a cliché. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
oscar WASSUUUUP!
dwight Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary.
jim Get out.
dwight Jim. wha. Come on! What. what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
jim No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking.
dwight A bazooka. You remembered.
jim Of course I did.
dwight . Get out of my way.
all OH!
dwight Woo! Okay!
jim Yeah! Guten Prank number two.
jim Private Room.
oscar Yeah, brosef.
dwight Amazing.
jim Enjoy, enjoy.
guy Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry?
jim Okay, man, easy.
guy 
jim Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
andy Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral.
darryl That happens a lot?
andy Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
oscar Well, I bet it was a smash.
andy That's how I got my new job in the admissions office.
oscar Is that a volunteer program or.
andy No. It's a job. Things are going great.
darryl Let's get a drink in you, huh?
andy Yes.
meredith Whoo-hoo. Let's get this party started!
rachel Where's my angel.
angela This is my big sister Rachel.
rachel No, this is my big sister Angela.
angela We're very close. We even have our own special language.
rachel 
angela People love it.
rachel They do.
dwight Man, how long have we been sitting here?
stripper Hi, boys!
all Ohh.
clark Here we go!
dwight Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
stripper Hey, did somebody order the chef special?
darryl Right there.
dwight No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?
stripper I bet you boys have a big appetite.
dwight Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
stripper Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want.
dwight Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
stripper Ohh, shh.
dwight Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.
erin Whoo!
angela What? Okay.
pam Oh, boy.
erin Oh!
jakey Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed or cleaned or whatever.
phyllis Angela's special repairman is here.
angela Wait, what is this?
meredith Shut up. Jakey?
jakey Mom?
pam Wait, wait. What?
jakey Oh, man.
meredith No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom's not here.
pam Uh, that seems inappropriate.
meredith Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
jakey Okay.
meredith Take it off. . Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper's only as good as his song.
rachel oh, wowee wow.
angela Okay.
pam Whoo-hoo. go, Meredith's stripper son.
angela Rachel, are you all right?
rachel I don't know! I don't know.
angela Oh geeze. . Oh, my God!
meredith Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look.
angela Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
meredith Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
angela Uh, no. It's o. thank you. You know what? You don't have to. oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay.
dwight Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic.
clark Dwight, for the last time, she's not a waitress.
dwight You're telling me!
oscar If you want her to leave, just tip her.
dwight What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?
angela That was interesting. What was that?
phyllis It's just the wind.
angela Will you lock the door?
phyllis Okay. It's just the wind, see? Nothing.
angela Alright, see, you don't have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It's the wind. Just come and shut. OH! My God!
all 
erin Phyllis!
rachel What's happening?
dwight Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.
jim Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
dwight Good old Mose.
jim They think it was Mose.
dwight Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
oscar What is that?
dwight A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
jim Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?
dwight Right. Which one is that?
jim Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?
jim Is that Mose?
dwight Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
mose Well, first, buy us a drink.
all If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink.
dwight Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! Oh.
kevin Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six "wells. " Did I get that number right, Dwight?
dwight I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
kevin Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
dwight Why did you pick this place?
jim Ooh.
dwight You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
jim Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.
dwight Waste of a good hatchet.
jim Okay, just talk.
kevin Well, w.
dwight I heard you say "well" the first time.
jim I know dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.
dwight It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.
kevin You're just saying that to make me feel better.
dwight No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
kevin Is that all it was?
dwight That's it.
kevin Come here
dwight I missed you Kevin.
kevin I missed you!
dwight Ohh. . push;
mose Guten Prank.
jim Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
dwight You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?
dwight Mose! What. ooh, Mose.
angela What the is your problem you ?!
jim Hey. Hey, is angela coming or.
dwight No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
jim Right.
stanley Hey guys.
all Stanley!
erin How's Florida?
stanley Oh, great.
stanley Yes, I'm living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
jim Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
pam No, no, I'm fine.
jim Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
stanley I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
andy I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral. Just sit here and cry, just sit here and cry! Oh I can so just sit here and cry. You guys are really mean. It can't end like this you know. Slept in my car last night, quit my job. Burned all my bridges. And I did unspeakable things – You're just not good, you're just not good. – Are you insane? – You're just not good, you're just not good. – Chill out! Just sit here and cry.
kevin People actually dance to this. It's in my juke box. None of the money goes to andy though.
kevin Yeah, people hate you.
andy I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home.
man Hey! It's andy Bernard!
all Nard Dog! Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
andy Ree-De-De-De-Doo! man 1
 How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv? David
wallace It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it.
dwight With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a. k. a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
pete Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So. thanks PBS. woman 1
 Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we'd all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay jim back for leaving Athlead?
pam Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something.
jim She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.
all Awww.
jim O-Kay. woman 2
 all I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that. he could do anything. Anything.
pam I'm sorry. Is there a question? woman 2
 Uh, no. man 2
 Pam, what was in that teapot letter?
pam Oh, um, well, you know, I. I just. I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself. man 2
 I hear ya. What did it say?
moderator We're gonna move on. Next question please. man 3
 Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore?
toby Yes. woman 3
 I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?
meredith I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn't show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college. woman 4
 I have a question for jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when jim moved to Philadelphia?
jim Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
pam Listen, um. I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end. And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it. woman 4
 Like Harry Potter.
pam Yeah, like Harry Potter.
joan I have a question for Erin.
erin Really?
joan Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother.
erin Thank you.
joan So my question is, um, do. don't you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her.
erin Maybe sometimes. But not like "hate" hate. More just like, "Mom, I hate you!" And then she would say "go to your room, young lady. " And I'd stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we'd just have dinner together. But I don't know. I'd have to meet her. Thanks.
joan Erin.
erin Yes?
joan Um. Oh, Erin.
erin Yes? Is there a follow-up question? Mom?
ed Erin. Same question but about your dad?
moderator Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let's thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today. Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don't forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic.
kevin Where's the, uh, basket for gifts?
usher Right there, sir.

ravi They're called premature, sweetie. It's good to see you again Ryan.
phyllis Let me help you us.
angela Thanks. Oh. Ouch.
pam Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
angela No, my heels aren't too high. It's because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. Sorry Phyllis. You didn't know. As long as I can get to the altar.
phyllis Oh, I'm gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
jim You ready?
dwight You kidding? I was born ready.
jim Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um. I don't know how to tell you this, but. we have a little bit of a problem.
dwight Oh, no. What?
jim The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
dwight Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.
jim I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-
dwight Not. significant is a big word.
jim I think it's definitely. Well, okay. Either way.
dwight I think you're only a teeny.
jim Either way, Dwight. I can't be there for you. I'm sorry.
dwight Jim.
jim I just. really wish there was something I could do.
dwight Michael. I can't believe you came.
michael That's what she said.
jim Best prank ever.
minister As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do.
nellie See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
kevin "Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. "
minister I now pronounce you man and wife. Release the doves!
kelly Oh.
kevin That's not.
dwight Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ‘em on in there.
dwight Everybody!
jim See, now you don't owe me anything.
ryan Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he's hot.
ravi Oh, no.
ryan I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
ravi Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?
ryan Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
ravi Are you sure you don't wanna go in?
kelly Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
ryan Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
kelly I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good.
ryan He'll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He's allergic but he'll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
kelly You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me?
pam michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
pam Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!
pam He just so happy to have a family plan.
ed Where'd you learn to dance like that?
erin I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing.
toby 
pam Is it me? Is it Nellie?
toby It's everything.
phyllis I missed you.
stanley I missed you too.
phyllis Lots of people think that stanley Hudson's a mean old grump. But would a grump make this? It's me. It's me.
ryan I love you.
kelly I love you too.
ryan We're gonna be together forever.
kelly We're running off into the sunset.
ryan I finally mastered commitment.
kevin What was that stuff?
ravi Hey, has anyone seen Ryan. or Kelly?
kevin Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
ravi Oh, that's it. Here. Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We'll find a better parent than ryan in no time.
kevin Oh, I don't know.
nellie Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will. who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
kevin Hey, this is better.
nellie Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
nellie If ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We'll be somewhere in Europe. Won't we?
michael I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.
darryl Thank you go much.

jim No, really, what's going on?
pam Okay, Okay. Um. so. this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just. I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big jim gesture. and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
jim Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
pam About 2 months
jim That's why it's so clean.
pam Yeah.

pam Austin? Maybe.
jim I promise you, you don't have to do this for me.
pam I'm doing it for us.
jim The last.
buyer Okay. We'll take it.
jim Hold on a second. The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about.
pam Hold on a second. Wait, what did you just say?
buyer We wanna buy your house.
jim You wanna do this?
pam I wanna do this.
jim You really want to do this?
pam I really want to do this!
jim Oh my God!
jim Hey, Darryl.
darryl What? all right!
pam We're so excited.
phyllis Cool.
woman Oh, that's for PBS executives only.
stanley I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this. David
wallace I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I'd love to contribute to your campaign.
oscar Thank you David.
pam Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper. , which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. all of us. And this is for you Jim. And go ahead!
pam Everyone, Let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just. I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
photographer Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. all right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody.
jim Let's go outside
pam Okay.
stanley Okay, I need a drink.
kevin Yeah, we all need a drink. What the. there's only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
meredith Hey, bottom drawer.
kevin Yes!
pam Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.
pam I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But. it would just. just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself "be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long. "
kevin If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural.
dwight Hey guys.
angela Hi.
all Hey!
pam What about the honeymoon?
angela Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
dwight Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? What is that meaningful look?
jim You know what? Maybe we should talk.
darryl Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
kevin What is it?
andy You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn.
pam I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing.
jim Athleap.
pam And jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially.
dwight No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!
jim Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note.
dwight Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.
pam Thanks Dwight.
jim Hey, and if you're ever in Austin.
dwight Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay. in my barn.
jim There it is.
dwight Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So. have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So. yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
andy You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with
me
 Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
kevin Oh, Yes!
darryl You did good. Real good.
andy Thanks Dad. Darryl.
andy I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. Someone should write a song about that.
oscar You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way. And that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami.
creed Uh. ohh!
creed I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same.
jim Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes. and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's. an amazing gift.
phyllis Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
jim Thanks Phyl.
creed I still have my medal from that.
angela Do you even have a mattress?
creed No, but I still have my medal from that.
kevin Oscar. Oscar. I think I'm gay.
oscar Why do you say that?
kevin It's just that I'm so emotional.
oscar Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay.
kevin No, but maybe the reason.
oscar You're not gay.
creed And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
erin How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
darryl Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
creed It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But. no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. Let's do this.
meredith I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they're the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You're not alone sister. Let's get a beer sometime.
phyllis I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
jim I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid. wonderful. boring. amazing job.
pam I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all. I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?
