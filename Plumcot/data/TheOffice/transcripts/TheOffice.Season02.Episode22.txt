michael_scott Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening." Makes you feel good.
jim_halpert Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
dwight_schrute I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
pam_beesly It's a nice tux.
dwight_schrute I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
roy_anderson So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
pam_beesly Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
dwight_schrute Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
jim_halpert I can always kind of win at roulette.
dwight_schrute Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
jim_halpert Yeah.
dwight_schrute How would you do that?
jim_halpert Mind control.
dwight_schrute You can't be serious. Are you serious?
jim_halpert Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
dwight_schrute I don't believe you. Continue.
jim_halpert It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
dwight_schrute That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
jim_halpert Okay, I'll try.
dwight_schrute Oh, my God.
michael_scott I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
jan_levinson Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
michael_scott Top 80 percent!
jan_levinson Michael?
michael_scott Yeah?
jan_levinson You know that I'm very serious here.
michael_scott Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
jan_levinson What?
michael_scott Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
jan_levinson I thought that you were their fearless leader.
michael_scott I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
jan_levinson I think you can handle it.
michael_scott Oh, come on. Come on.
jan_levinson I think so, Michael...
michael_scott You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
jan_levinson Goodbye, Michael.
michael_scott Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
michael_scott Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
oscar_martinez Again? We do that every year.
michael_scott Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
oscar_martinez It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
michael_scott Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
jim_halpert That doesn't exist anymore.
michael_scott Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
pam_beesly No, they stopped making that show.
michael_scott Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
angela_martin You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
creed_bratton There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
kevin_malone Something with animals. Or people.
kelly_kapoor Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is so hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. ...Maybe he did it.
angela_martin We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity?
michael_scott Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
toby_flenderson Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
michael_scott Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
jim_halpert I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
michael_scott No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
phyllis_vance Afghani.
michael_scott What?
phyllis_vance Afghani.
michael_scott That's a dog.
pam_beesly No, that's Afghan.
michael_scott That's a shawl.
dwight_schrute Wait, canine AIDS?
michael_scott No. Humans with AIDS.
creed_bratton Who has AIDS?
jim_halpert Guys, the Afghanistananies.
michael_scott Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
michael_scott There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head." And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
jim_halpert What are you doing?
pam_beesly Oh, nothing.
jim_halpert "Till Death Do Us Rock."
pam_beesly They're wedding bands.
jim_halpert Oh.
pam_beesly Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
jim_halpert Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
pam_beesly There's a KISS cover band in here.
jim_halpert Let's do it.
pam_beesly I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
jim_halpert Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
michael_scott I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
darryl_philbin Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
michael_scott It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
darryl_philbin Except my warehouse.
michael_scott Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
dwight_schrute Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
michael_scott Why are you here?
dwight_schrute When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
michael_scott Not. I said, not that.
darryl_philbin We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
michael_scott That's ironic.
darryl_philbin What?
michael_scott That you are afraid.
darryl_philbin Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
michael_scott Dinkin' flicka.
darryl_philbin Dinkin' flicka.
darryl_philbin I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out." "Going mach five." "Dinkin' flicka." You know, things us Negroes say.
michael_scott Give me some.
darryl_philbin Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
jim_halpert Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
pam_beesly I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
jim_halpert Yes.
pam_beesly Have three stages, yeah.
jim_halpert Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert Let's take a look. Nice.
pam_beesly Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly On the drums! On the drums!
jim_halpert Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
kevin_malone We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
jim_halpert Wow. Oh!
pam_beesly Oh, my...
jim_halpert Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
pam_beesly No! No!
jim_halpert No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
pam_beesly No, come back! No, no, no!
jim_halpert Kev!
pam_beesly Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
michael_scott Yes
pam_beesly Michael, Carol Stills for you.
michael_scott Who?
pam_beesly Carol Stills.
michael_scott Do I know a Carol Stills?
pam_beesly Your realtor.
michael_scott Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good?
pam_beesly It's still me.
pam_beesly Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
pam_beesly Carol, you're on with Michael.
carol_stills Hello, Michael?
michael_scott Hi, Carol. How you doing?
carol_stills I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
michael_scott Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
carol_stills Oh, great.
michael_scott Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
carol_stills Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
michael_scott Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
carol_stills Oh, great.
michael_scott Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
carol_stills To the casino thing?
michael_scott Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...
carol_stills What?
michael_scott Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
pam_beesly Michael, Jan's on line two.
michael_scott Okay, put her through. Jan Levinson, I presume?
pam_beesly It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.
jan_levinson Michael?
michael_scott Hey, Jan. How you doing?
jan_levinson You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
michael_scott I am?
jan_levinson I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
michael_scott Oh, okay.
jan_levinson Incidentally, what is the charity?
michael_scott AIDS.
jan_levinson Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
michael_scott Okay, sounds great.
jan_levinson Bye-bye.
michael_scott Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
carol_stills No problemo.
michael_scott Right.
carol_stills To answer your question...
michael_scott Yeah?
carol_stills Yes.
michael_scott What?
carol_stills I'd love to go.
michael_scott Okay.
carol_stills I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
michael_scott Problem. Good.
carol_stills And I'll bring the papers, too.
michael_scott Good, All right. Sounds great.
carol_stills I'll see you tonight.
michael_scott Bye.
carol_stills Bye.
michael_scott Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
pam_beesly Oh, my God!
roy_anderson Yeah! That's great.
michael_scott Hey, hey.
carol_stills Hi.
michael_scott Hey, Carol.
carol_stills Hi.
michael_scott You look great.
carol_stills Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
michael_scott Oh, well... Kiss. That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight
dwight_schrute Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
dwight_schrute I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, "We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them."
michael_scott Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
carol_stills Drink would be good.
michael_scott Okay.
creed_bratton Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Billy's#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode22 Girlfriend I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
billy_merchant No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart.
Billy's#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode22 Girlfriend Okay.
michael_scott Billy, your nurse is hot.
billy_merchant That's my girlfriend.
michael_scott Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
billy_merchant She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.
michael_scott Chili's is great.
michael_scott Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
stanley_hudson Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
michael_scott Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Dealer#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode22 Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.
michael_scott All-in.
michael_scott Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
toby_flenderson I'll call.
michael_scott What are... That's insane.
toby_flenderson I have good cards.
michael_scott Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Dealer#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode22 No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in.
michael_scott Okay, all right, whatever.
Dealer#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode22 Flip them.
michael_scott You really screwed that up.
meredith_palmer Wow.
toby_flenderson I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
dwight_schrute I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
jim_halpert I will raise. Thanks.
jim_halpert It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
carol_stills Wow, bad luck.
michael_scott Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
jan_levinson Michael?
michael_scott Jan.
jan_levinson Hi.
michael_scott Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
jan_levinson What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
carol_stills What does that mean?
michael_scott After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
jan_levinson No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
carol_stills Hi, hi.
jan_levinson Does anyone want a drink?
carol_stills No, I'm good.
jan_levinson Okay.
michael_scott Um...
dwight_schrute Hey, hey.
michael_scott Hey. What...
dwight_schrute Jan's here.
dwight_schrute Give me the dice.
kevin_malone Come on, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Let's go.
billy_merchant It's all on you, baby. Let's go.
angela_martin Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
dwight_schrute Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
kevin_malone Yes.
angela_martin Then roll an eight.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Angela.
angela_martin Good luck, Dwight.

jim_halpert What was this?
pam_beesly I have good cards.
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.
jim_halpert Wow. I think you're bluffing.
kevin_malone Yeah, I think she's full of it.
pam_beesly Straight.
jim_halpert Oh. Three nines.
kevin_malone Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
jim_halpert Thank you very much. It was fun.
jan_levinson Cosmopolitan, please.
carol_stills Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
jan_levinson Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
carol_stills Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
jan_levinson Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
carol_stills Well, I'm having a nice time.
jan_levinson Oh, me too. Me too.
ryan_howard One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
jim_halpert So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
michael_scott All right!
Dealer#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode22 The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!
dwight_schrute Come on, shooter!
michael_scott Four! Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. All right, here we go!
carol_stills All right.

jan_levinson What?
dwight_schrute Super 8?
jan_levinson No, I...
dwight_schrute Motel 6? Best Western?
jan_levinson I didn't... I don't know...
dwight_schrute Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
kevin_malone I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
kevin_malone All-in.
phyllis_vance Okay, let's do it.
bob_vance Vance Good Luck, honey.
phyllis_vance Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
kevin_malone Three queens.

phyllis_vance I have an ace.
oscar_martinez No, that's a flush.
dwight_schrute Oh, man!
phyllis_vance Oh, I have a flush!
bob_vance Yes!
phyllis_vance Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
kevin_malone I suck.
roy_anderson She took you down, huh?
kevin_malone I do not want to talk about it.
roy_anderson Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
kevin_malone Yeah?
roy_anderson Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
kevin_malone Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
roy_anderson Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
kevin_malone Dude, you will not be sorry.
roy_anderson Sweet. All right.
kevin_malone All right.
jan_levinson Smoke?
jim_halpert No, thanks. You having fun?
jan_levinson Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
jim_halpert Yeah, we all really...
jan_levinson Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
jim_halpert Well, I think you look great.
jan_levinson Why did I hook up with Michael?
jim_halpert Yeah, why did you?
jan_levinson It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
jim_halpert Oh, yeah.
jan_levinson Good. Have you told anyone?
jim_halpert No.
jan_levinson Well, you should.
bob_vance Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin!
creed_bratton Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
roy_anderson Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
pam_beesly It's okay. I'll see you at home.
roy_anderson Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
pam_beesly Okay.
roy_anderson If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
jim_halpert Okay, will do.
roy_anderson See you.
pam_beesly Bye! Hey.
jim_halpert Hey, how's it going?
pam_beesly Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
jim_halpert Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
pam_beesly About when you want to give me more of your money?
jim_halpert No, I...
pam_beesly Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
jim_halpert I was just... I'm in love with you.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
pam_beesly What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
jim_halpert I just needed you to know. Once.
pam_beesly Well, I um... I... I can't.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly You have no idea...
jim_halpert Don't do that.
pam_beesly ...what your friendship means to me.
jim_halpert Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be more than that.
pam_beesly I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
jim_halpert Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
jan_levinson Hey. I'm leaving.
michael_scott Hey, okay.
jan_levinson So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
michael_scott Thank you.
jan_levinson And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
michael_scott Okay. Thanks for coming.
jan_levinson Nice to meet you.
carol_stills You, too.
jan_levinson And you guys have a good time together.
michael_scott Okay. Talk to you Monday.
jan_levinson Yeah.
carol_stills Goodbye.
michael_scott Good night. She's a good boss.
carol_stills She seems really nice.
michael_scott Oh, she's great.
michael_scott Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
pam_beesly About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am. I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim...
