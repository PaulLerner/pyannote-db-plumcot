dwight_schrute Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you!
jim_halpert Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
dwight_schrute How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch
jim_halpert OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
dwight_schrute No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!
kevin_malone No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
dwight_schrute False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!
jim_halpert OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
dwight_schrute That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.
jim_halpert So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
dwight_schrute Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. Block. Grasp wrist as such.
jim_halpert And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
dwight_schrute Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!
jim_halpert Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
dwight_schrute He really is, but not for long. Ow! Instep, oh, not again. You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
jim_halpert You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
dwight_schrute The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.
michael_scott But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
andy_bernard I did stand up comedy once.
michael_scott You did?
andy_bernard Yeah, I killed.
michael_scott That sounds like it was hilarious.
andy_bernard It was hilarious.
dwight_schrute Michael?
michael_scott Yes?
dwight_schrute What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
michael_scott You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
dwight_schrute This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
michael_scott Woo hoo, shout out!
dwight_schrute Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
michael_scott Erin, do we have the journal?
erin_hannon Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.
michael_scott Did you?
pam_beesly Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
michael_scott Oh, the Wall.
oscar_martinez I found the article. "On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's. It is rumored that they will recommend... " and the article cuts off.
michael_scott It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say?
jim_halpert Are you serious?
andy_bernard I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
phyllis_vance "It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy."
michael_scott No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
stanley_hudson Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
oscar_martinez Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
michael_scott Oh, that sounds awful.
oscar_martinez Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
michael_scott Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory.
dwight_schrute You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
david_wallace Wallace's Secretary I'm sorry, Michael, David's in a meeting.
michael_scott Ah, well maybe you should spy on him. Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious!
david_wallace Wallace's Secretary Um, I'll just have him call you back.
michael_scott OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye. He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.
kevin_malone Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there?
michael_scott No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be.
kevin_malone It smells like throw up in here.
michael_scott Crazy world. Lotta smells.
kelly_kapoor Guys, what if this is our last day at work? What if we never see each other ever again?
andy_bernard I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
jim_halpert We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
michael_scott OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.
jim_halpert Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
michael_scott Monkey see, monkey do.
jim_halpert That's it.
michael_scott Monkey pee all over you.
jim_halpert That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
michael_scott We have a monthly staff meeting
jim_halpert Alright, let's conference room it up! Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
jim_halpert Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good.
jim_halpert Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
dwight_schrute He needs me. Seat saved infinity.
jim_halpert OK, great.
michael_scott What? Oh my God! There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah.
michael_scott Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
meredith_palmer Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
michael_scott It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
jim_halpert Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
michael_scott This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.
jim_halpert I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
michael_scott Tube City, you owe me one.
jim_halpert Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.
stephanie on CD player August the 5th, 1955. It's a sad day down here in Savannah. Local magnate Bill Bourbon was killed last night and all y'all have congregated tonight for a meal to celebrate Bill as he passes on to his great reward. You're not just here to pay your respects, you have to figure out which of y'all is the no-count scoundrel who killed him.
stanley_hudson This is ridiculous.
michael_scott There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
stanley_hudson What kind of food?
michael_scott Sandwich platters.
stanley_hudson I'm in.
michael_scott Baby carrots.
michael_scott OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
kevin_malone Whoa, I'll try it.
michael_scott OK, use your imaginations.
andy_bernard Who'd you get?
erin_hannon Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
andy_bernard Oooooo, saucy.
erin_hannon How about you?
andy_bernard Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.
angela_martin Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary.
michael_scott It's not scary.
angela_martin I don't like my character.
pam_beesly Who are you?
angela_martin Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps. I'm not comfortable with this.
michael_scott Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
michael_scott Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare?
oscar_martinez It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
michael_scott Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
ryan_howard You don't have to keep saying "I do declare". Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
michael_scott That is the way Southern people talk.
jim_halpert And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
michael_scott Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?
pam_beesly I'll go. My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short.
andy_bernard That's clever, Debutante.
pam_beesly Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
meredith_palmer Nice accent. You sound like Forrest Gump.
pam_beesly I do not.
andy_bernard Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
kevin_malone Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.
andy_bernard Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
kevin_malone He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.
phyllis_vance You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
dwight_schrute Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
michael_scott No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.
dwight_schrute I will poison your food.
andy_bernard I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
michael_scott Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
michael_scott I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
kevin_malone Y'all.
creed_bratton Sorry I'm late, boss. What's going on?
michael_scott Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
creed_bratton OK. Hang on just a second. Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
michael_scott Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
andy_bernard Hey there young lady.
erin_hannon Hello.
andy_bernard I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
erin_hannon Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
andy_bernard Alright, a plan it is.
dwight_schrute Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
angela_martin It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
dwight_schrute I know you did it!
dwight_schrute I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
kevin_malone Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses.
erin_hannon Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
meredith_palmer How about a threesome?
erin_hannon Yeah, my boudoir's always open.
kevin_malone Nice.
andy_bernard I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a murderer.
oscar_martinez I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
phyllis_vance What does that mean?
oscar_martinez Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
michael_scott Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah.
oscar_martinez This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay... - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
jim_halpert OK, I'm going back to work.
michael_scott No no no no no no no. I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go.
stephanie on CD player Well by now you've figured out that ol' Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.
phyllis_vance Michael, I was doing so well.
michael_scott Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is. Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
jim_halpert OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
kevin_malone That could be a good sign.
angela_martin Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up.
jim_halpert Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
kevin_malone Now, Jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign.
angela_martin Don't just say things.
jim_halpert Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-
michael_scott I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case.
jim_halpert No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed.
michael_scott No it ain't.
dwight_schrute Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
andy_bernard Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.
erin_hannon I haven't seen it.
andy_bernard Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
erin_hannon Of course, Nathaniel.
andy_bernard Yeah, OK.
erin_hannon Where are you taking me?
andy_bernard Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.
erin_hannon Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton.
andy_bernard Did you mean a real date?
erin_hannon No. Did you?
andy_bernard Totally... not.
erin_hannon I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
dwight_schrute You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
michael_scott I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
dwight_schrute Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
michael_scott This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir.
dwight_schrute Answer me.
michael_scott You are out of order.
dwight_schrute You are out of order.
michael_scott You are-
pam_beesly I think Michael may have snapped.
jim_halpert Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
pam_beesly Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
jim_halpert Both. They're both worse.
jim_halpert It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under.
pam_beesly Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
michael_scott Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
jim_halpert Michael, not now.
michael_scott Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on.
pam_beesly I should just go. Where to now Caleb?
michael_scott To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
jim_halpert Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
michael_scott Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
meredith_palmer I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
dwight_schrute Hey shut up. You're dead.
jim_halpert Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
michael_scott No Michael here, my name is-
jim_halpert Caleb!
jim_halpert Today of all days...
michael_scott No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright?
michael_scott Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for?
erin_hannon Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.
michael_scott Detective Wallace?
erin_hannon I don't think so. I think it's David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
michael_scott Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.
oscar_martinez You're not gonna answer the phone?
michael_scott No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.
jim_halpert I'll take it.
jim_halpert Hey David.
david_wallace Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
jim_halpert Oh, OK.
david_wallace But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well... You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK?
jim_halpert Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
david_wallace You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run.
jim_halpert OK.
david_wallace Thanks Jim.
jim_halpert See ya.
pam_beesly What's the news?
jim_halpert Nothing yet.
phyllis_vance Well, I guess that's not-
jim_halpert Well there is some bad news. There has been another murder.
michael_scott A murder, you say? I do declare.
jim_halpert Conference room everyone.
stanley_hudson Do we have to play?
jim_halpert No.
stanley_hudson Super.
dwight_schrute Oh, this could be a juicy one.
michael_scott Get in there!
jim_halpert I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now.
michael_scott There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more. Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
andy_bernard I didn't do it!
dwight_schrute OK, everybody just calm down.
andy_bernard I am calm.
michael_scott On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
dwight_schrute I have crossbows.
michael_scott We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
dwight_schrute OK, I'm ready.
michael_scott One, two, three..
jim_halpert Andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6 00.
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this!
jim_halpert Yeah, I want to go home.
pam_beesly Get the keys out of my purse, start the car.
