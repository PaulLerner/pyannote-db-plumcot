erin They're back!
kevin Oooh yeah. jim and Pam!
kelly How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
jim It was.
pam It really was.
jim Really was.
kelly I'm so happy for you.
jim Puerto Rico was awesome.
pam Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
jim Frank and Beans. Always makes her laugh.
pam Frank and beans!
michael Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
dwight Yeah!
michael Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
dwight Its jim and Pam, Michael.
michael It is?
dwight Yeah.
michael They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!
jim Nope.
michael And oh, Jim.
pam Hi, Michael.
michael Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
michael Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
meredith So what'd you bring us?
pam Some candy.
meredith What else?
pam That's it.
meredith Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
michael 
pam It's good to be home.
dwight This conversation has two items on the agenda.
jim Do we have a conversation scheduled?
dwight Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two. I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say. con-quack-ulations!
jim Wow, that's. really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
dwight You're welcome!
dwight I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
dwight I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
jim It's a real handsome duck.
dwight Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
pam Hey!
erin Hi!
pam Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
erin Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
pam Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
erin Oh, um, let me just check with michael first.
pam I think it'll be okay.
erin I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
pam Great.
erin Oops, sorry. Oops.
michael I have recently taken a lover.
jim Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
michael Pam's mom.
jim What?
michael Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
jim You're messing with me.
michael About what?
jim You did not have s*x with Pam's mom.
michael Oh, big time.
jim What kind of car does she drive?
michael She drives a green camry.
jim 
michael And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
jim Oh my God. Oh my God.
michael What?
jim Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
michael Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell pam over dinner. You alright?
jim Oh my God.
toby Hey, Jim.
jim Not now, Toby, my God!
toby Oh, Jesus!
michael Get the hell out of here, idiot.
toby What did I do?
jim Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
michael I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
jim No, not more than anything.
michael Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
jim Don't call her "the mom. "
michael She's right on my way home from work.
jim Then take a different way home, man!
michael I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
jim Okay, so we're good.
michael Yeah.
michael Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
erin Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
michael Sure. Thanks for asking.
erin Pam, we're all set. Yum.
jim Frank and beans!
pam Frank and beans! So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
jim You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
pam Bottle of rum it is. Alright, shall we?
jim You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
pam Come on, it'll take two seconds.
jim No, it-
michael Oh, wow.
pam 
michael That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
erin Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
michael Erin, look.
erin Fun!
michael Yeah.
pam Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
michael Yeah, no, it's nobody.
pam I don't know. I think michael has a date.
michael Hmm. no.
pam I think you have a date.
michael I don't.
pam Come on.
jim Uh, I think we should just drop it. 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
michael I don't deserve this, guys.
jim Yes, you do.
michael No, I don't.
jim Just take the parrot.
michael 
jim Okay, back to the old grind.
michael I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
pam Oh, that's too bad.
jim Don't-
michael Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
jim Sounds complicated.
michael It is.
pam Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
michael You want me to be happy?
pam Of course.
michael Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
pam Oh.
michael More than a friend, a co-worker.
pam Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? . Who?
michael It's okay.
pam No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
michael That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
pam 
dwight You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
michael Okay.
dwight There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down.
michael Feels good.
dwight There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down.
michael I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.
dwight . the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down. You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
pam How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
jim Who wants a hot chocolate?
pam Thank you.
jim Oh, so dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
pam You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with michael Scott.
jim Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
andy Sure thing, Tuna Boss.
jim 
andy How may I be of service to you?
jim I am gonna need your advice I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
andy This aurea is a joke.
jim Really?
andy What are you thinking?
jim I was gonna go with this one.
andy Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
dwight The Nard Dog. what was that all about?
andy I know, right?
dwight What were you talking about in there?
andy Trust me it would only make you mad. . push;
michael Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
andy Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
michael That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
pam Haha! Ha ha ha.
jim And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.
michael Who wants to help the world one step at a time? Alright, good.
dwight Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
michael Alright, that's.
meredith Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
michael Alright.
pam I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.
michael Okay, I'm out of here, see you later guys.
various Get out and stay out, bye.
michael Ok, oh no here's an idea. conservation.
pam I love it, conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings. No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings!
michael Anybody else? Who else has an idea?
angela I have some ideas about conservation.
jim Yes! Angela! Please.
michael Can you hold down the fort? Hey boo!
angela Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally.
michael What's it. why are you crying?
jim Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder.
kevin Shhhh.
angela Well, for our profit.
kevin Shhh.
michael No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will. No. nobody talks to my baby that way. uh ah. yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle.
kevin Who's pickle?
michael Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
angela I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
jim Yes.
oscar Hold on, hold on, what's going on?
jim Nothing. nothing at all. it's all good!
pam I'm not apologizing to anyone. michael owes me an apology.
michael For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
pam Don't call my mother your lover.
kevin Yes! That's what I'm talking about.
andy That is not okay dude.
michael Alright, in my defense.
phyllis Disgusting.
creed She's messed up man.
pam Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
oscar You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
michael Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.
phyllis Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
oscar Maybe you're right, who are we to.
pam Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
dwight I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
michael Let's get back to the matter at hand.
pam Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom.
michael No, no, no. no, no.
ryan Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about.
michael I don't like the tone here. this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
pam Uhh, huh, ho. oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
michael Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
pam You are never going to be my father, you get out!
michael I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am.
pam Me too.
pam Hey.
oscar Hey.
angela Pam, how's your day going?
oscar Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
pam Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if michael was sleeping with your mom?
oscar My mother's in a wheelchair.
pam Well, he could still. I'm sorry about that. Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
kelly Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
ryan Ahh, I don't think so, no.
kelly Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora?
ryan I'd rather not say.
kelly I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
erin Hi Dwight!
dwight Shh!
ryan . it should go with the persona you already have.
kelly Well, I think I have that persona.
dwight Where did you get that mallard?
kelly What the hell is a mallard?
dwight That!
kelly Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, jim gave him to me.
dwight Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
kelly If you take it back, I'll scream.
dwight I'll give you five bucks for it.
ryan Twenty.
dwight Ten.
ryan Deal.
kelly You're so cool.
ryan This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
michael Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
toby Yeah, sure, what's up?
michael Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was. uncalled for, I'm sorry.
toby Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot. Thank you for saying it.
michael Can I sit down for a second?
toby Yeah, er. pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
michael This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole pam situation.
toby Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
michael She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
toby Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
michael Really? Would you do that?
toby Yeah. that's why they pay me the big bucks.
michael You're a good, good guy.
toby I'm good.
toby You know, I always knew if michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
toby Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
pam Sure, what's up?
toby Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
pam What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
michael No. that's.
toby Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off. you know.
pam Oh, would that make you feel better?
michael I don't. um. I can't hear your conversation.
pam You can tell michael that I'm not leaving.
toby Buddy, I think that.
michael Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay. you're a jackass. Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
stanley Heh, heh, heh.
pam Michael, you're just her rebound!
michael You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
pam What! You knew?
jim Barely, I. I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean.
michael Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will.
pam Mmmmm, yes!
michael Well, that is not gonna happen!
pam Then why'd you even offer!?
michael Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
pam Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!
michael You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
pam What's that supposed to mean?
michael You know what it means.
jim Hey.
pam Shut it!
jim Yep.
michael I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt. although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.
jim Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
dwight Well, I had to, I mean. kelly was not even.
jim Hi buddy.
dwight I'm sorry.
jim A wooden duck?
dwight Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
jim Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage.
dwight Oh, I'm equipped. I can.
jim Silence.
dwight Don't tell Michael.
jim I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car.
dwight Punishment fits the crime, I accept.
michael Night everyone. Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.
erin Night Michael.
michael Night Erin.
jim Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car.
pam Awww, he did that for me?
jim Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
pam Mmmm.
jim Remember that older couple whose kids were also named jim and Pam?
pam Haha, yeah. Say more nice things.
jim Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
pam Maybe I'm overreacting.
jim Yeah. maybe.
pam But I don't think I am.
jim You're not, nope. Nope.
kevin Oh. where'd you get that hat?
ryan I'd rather not say.
dwight "We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our. " I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane. ". 65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer. "
