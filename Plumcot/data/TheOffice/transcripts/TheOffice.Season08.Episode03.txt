dwight_schrute ....back orders and you never called them.
oscar_martinez Can you believe this?
erin_hannon There's a dog in the car.
oscar_martinez You can't leave a dog in a parked car. Snowboarder, it figures.
jim_halpert Do Snowboarders hate animals?
oscar_martinez I bet this guy didn't leave his weed in the car. OK we have to do something because this is incredibly dangerous.
andy_bernard Oscar, it's not that hot out.
darryl_philbin A car parked in the sun is like a toaster oven.
andy_bernard Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
kelly_kapoor So what, Andy, you wanna just let him die, you scumbag?
kevin_malone Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
dwight_schrute OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. Come on.
jim_halpert Dwight! At least aim it.
dwight_schrute There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
andy_bernard We're losing cloud cover.
kelly_kapoor Oh don't try to get in on it now, Michael Vick.
darryl_philbin Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
oscar_martinez This guy's been gone long enough. He's lost his right to a window.
jim_halpert Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
oscar_martinez Come on buddy, get back.
dwight_schrute Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey!
jim_halpert Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
oscar_martinez And one for good measure!
jim_halpert So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?
oscar_martinez Why would we take the dog?
jim_halpert What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
oscar_martinez Jim, he's not gonna star-
meredith_palmer Whoa!
oscar_martinez Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
dwight_schrute Nein. Sits. Goot.
jim_halpert Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
oscar_martinez There we go. That should do it.
jim_halpert Yeah, that's pretty good.
dwight_schrute Yeah, that'll work.
kelly_kapoor That'll work.
jim_halpert Nice job.
dwight_schrute Bye poochie!
kelly_kapoor Bye.
meredith_palmer Bye!
pam_beesly What's that come to? Like, what did they each win?
jim_halpert Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
pam_beesly Awesome.
dwight_schrute Before taxes.
phyllis_vance That's still a lot of money!
andy_bernard The warehouse crew won the lottery yesterday. Nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars. And then they quit!...and no one else can focus. This is it. This is all on my shoulders. I'm the one who has to tell everyone to get back to work, I'm the one who has to tell Darryl to hire a new warehouse crew. I'm the one who has to say those things.
darryl_philbin Hello?....Justine! Nice surprise! How you doin' baby?....Nah. No no, I didn't win. When I got promoted I stop-...what?...Yeah. Yeah, Glenn won....Oh, you wanna call him? Yeah, you should call him, congratulate him. That'll be-...What?....Oh, his number's in your old phone. Oh, you know what? I might have it right- Whoops.
darryl_philbin When I worked in the warehouse, I was part of that lotto pool. They won ... playing my birthday.
oscar_martinez What really interests me is the group dynamic of six people winning the lottery. This will not end well. Right?
phyllis_vance Yeah.
meredith_palmer We're lookin' at at least one suicide and one weird s*x thing.
oscar_martinez At least.
jim_halpert I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
dwight_schrute I know what you'd do with all that money. "Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug."
jim_halpert No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
pam_beesly And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?
jim_halpert Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
pam_beesly I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...
ryan_howard SoHo's mostly lofts but OK.
pam_beesly And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...
kelly_kapoor Oh, god.
pam_beesly And then my handsome husband...
jim_halpert Which ideally would be me....
pam_beesly Would bring me a flavored coffee.
jim_halpert Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
pam_beesly Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.
jim_halpert I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
meredith_palmer get a divorce...get a divorce...
kelly_kapoor I think I would keep working. And for my salary I guess I would take like a dollar a year....I mean obviously I wouldn't come in till noon and I wouldn't do anything I didn't wanna do. I mean I'm getting paid a dollar a year, OK? You can chill.
andy_bernard Are you kidding me?! Guys if I have to ask you to get back to work one more time, I'm gonna change my tone. To down here like Mr. T. and this will get seriously annoying. I feel sympathy for the jerks who have to listen to this all day. Darryl, how we doin' on the new warehouse guys?
darryl_philbin I don't know.
andy_bernard What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?
darryl_philbin No.
andy_bernard Are they on their way over?
darryl_philbin I haven't hired anyone.
phyllis_vance What? No warehouse guys? I have an important order that has to go out by five. I emailed you about it.
darryl_philbin I'm not checkin' email till lunch. Four hour work week.
andy_bernard This is kinda time sensitive.
darryl_philbin I got it. I'm doin' it.
phyllis_vance Andy, this is a seriously big order. I can't lose this client.
andy_bernard Alright, well until we have a new crew, let's get some volunteers for warehouse duty. Who's in?
erin_hannon As long as you guys don't need me up here.
phyllis_vance No..we don't
dwight_schrute I think we'll be fine.
oscar_martinez Really, nobody's gonna help her? Is chivalry dead?
andy_bernard Are you volunteering?
oscar_martinez Of course. I would. But my hip....I would kill to be at a hundred percent.
andy_bernard Jim! How 'bout you?
jim_halpert Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
dwight_schrute Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. False. Andy, I will volunteer.
andy_bernard Great. And Kevin.
kevin_malone Good old Kevin. He'll do anything. Well guess what? I will not do a good job.
pam_beesly Oh, thank you.
angela_martin Sure.
pam_beesly Wait, wait. What's this?
angela_martin Oh, sorry. I thought it was a guess your baby's birth weight pool.
pam_beesly It says "Lotto Pool", right on top.
angela_martin Yeah. And I said sorry.
pam_beesly Oh come on. You really think I'm gonna have a fourteen pound baby?
darryl_philbin When did I get so fat?
andy_bernard You look awesome.
darryl_philbin I didn't hire anyone if that's why you're here.
andy_bernard Where are we in the process?
darryl_philbin I have a file of applicants here. I just gotta open it, look at it, interview a bunch of guys,hire some of 'em. So I'd say we're in the early stages of the process.
andy_bernard Did you go out celebrating with the guys last night?
darryl_philbin The guys did invite me out to celebrate but I decided to just stay home. Eat a bunch of tacos in my basement.
andy_bernard You do have a fantastic basement.
darryl_philbin I did. I did have a fantastic basement. Now it smells like tacos. You can't air out a basement and taco air is heavy. Settles at the lowest point.
andy_bernard Right. Um, well how 'bout we take a look at some applications? ...This guy wrote his in green ink, that's pretty cool. Check it out. Hey! There ya go...there he is.
andy_bernard That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.
jim_halpert OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
dwight_schrute Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it!
jim_halpert Nice. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
kevin_malone Damn!
dwight_schrute Yup.
andy_bernard Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl. What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?
darryl_philbin You mean what did we do the last time the warehouse won the lottery?
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode03 Applicant Your old crew won the lottery?
andy_bernard Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode03 Applicant 1 Wait, wait. So all the old guys quit?
darryl_philbin Oh yeah.
andy_bernard Well-
darryl_philbin One of 'em, Glenn, is starting one of those fat camps where he steals your kid in the middle of the night. Madge and a couple other guys might start a strip club, but on a boat. And Heday is investing in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals.
andy_bernard Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?
darryl_philbin I don't
andy_bernard You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...
darryl_philbin Nope. I'm good. I'm here. Let's find some warehouse workers.
andy_bernard Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.
darryl_philbin OK.
andy_bernard We need you, OK?
darryl_philbin OK.
andy_bernard OK?
darryl_philbin Yeah.
andy_bernard Alright.
dwight_schrute What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband.
erin_hannon I didn't feel anything.
andy_bernard Alright! Thank you for coming back in, again. Uh, now we're gonna ask you a few questions. Darryl, you have the floor.
darryl_philbin Why do you wanna work here?
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode03 Applicant 1 I need a job.
darryl_philbin That's not a good reason.
andy_bernard Good. Keepin' 'em honest.
darryl_philbin Don't just take the first job that comes your way. Cause next thing you know, it's ten years later and you're still there. Could write your obituary tomorrow, it's not gonna change.
andy_bernard Are we scaring them straight....?
darryl_philbin I hope so. Think about this carefully. There's better lives than this one.
darryl_philbin I've never been lucky. And I'm not talkin' about the lottery, I'm talkin' 'bout stuff like developing a soy allergy at thirty-five. Who gets a soy allergy at thirty-five? And why is soy in everything?
ryan_howard Nice. Right back where I like you. Can you make ten copies of this for me?
pam_beesly No.
ryan_howard Why not? What are you doing?
pam_beesly Uh, buying lottery tickets online.
ryan_howard Ah, everyone wants to be rich, but nobody wants to work for it.
pam_beesly You came in at 10 30 today, right?
ryan_howard OK, ??????
andy_bernard Is everyone licensed?
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode03 Applicant 2 Like a driver's license?
andy_bernard No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode03 Applicant Is this a joke?
andy_bernard No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.
kevin_malone OK, I'm not gonna make it. I'm turning back.
jim_halpert There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
dwight_schrute Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
jim_halpert Yeah Not that they're not smart people.
dwight_schrute No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
jim_halpert I'd go with that.
dwight_schrute Like baboons or elephants.
jim_halpert Not that, don't...
kevin_malone Guys! When I was a kid, my sisters used to butter me up and slide me across the linoleum floor of the kitchen. Then really made them laugh.
jim_halpert It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
kevin_malone Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
dwight_schrute Kevin! Doesn't apply.
kevin_malone Right. My mom-
erin_hannon You need to drop it, OK? They hate it. I like it a lot but they hate it so drop it!
andy_bernard Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode03 Applicant 1 How much longer is this gonna take?
darryl_philbin Did you hire 'em?
andy_bernard No. Because they all left.
darryl_philbin What do you mean "they left"?
andy_bernard I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help.
darryl_philbin Then I think you should fire me.
andy_bernard What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.
darryl_philbin Yeah. Just put me out of my misery.
andy_bernard .....OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.
darryl_philbin No? OK. I don't wanna be here anymore. Fire me.
andy_bernard So Darryl says to me "fire me". But what he really means is "I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means." So I say "No, you're not fired." But what I really mean is "I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better."........I really hope that's what he and I mean.
andy_bernard Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.
oscar_martinez Bulk or definition?
andy_bernard Definition.
oscar_martinez Bruce Kenwood. He hangs out at Plant Fitness.
andy_bernard Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?
oscar_martinez Oh, he's plenty strong.
oscar_martinez It used to be Reggie Winters out at Gold's Gym. But he moved away. And then it was between Bruce and this guy Dean. Um, but Dean got fixated on his calves and uh, and his triceps went to hell.
pam_beesly So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....
jim_halpert Our fake winnings
pam_beesly And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.
jim_halpert It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
pam_beesly Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.
jim_halpert Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.
dwight_schrute Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
jim_halpert A...hot chocolate tea
andy_bernard Gideon. You are a PhD candidate studying America's diminishing blue-collar workforce?
gideon North America...and, diminishing is a little reductive, but uh sure. That's the headline version.
andy_bernard Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.
gideon FYI, Wednesday through Friday I have a pretty full teaching schedule.
andy_bernard Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.
nate Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble. Uh, again it's not that I can't hear, uh because that's false. I can. Um, I just can't distinguish between everything I'm hearing.
andy_bernard Got it. Dually noted. You! Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?
Bruce#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode03 Made it.
andy_bernard So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
dwight_schrute Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
jim_halpert Kevin Costner.
dwight_schrute Kevin Costner.
jim_halpert Yeah.
kevin_malone So I found this grease. And then I remembered that you thought it was a great idea.
erin_hannon You did say it was a great idea. I heard you say it!
jim_halpert So, it's not the dumbest idea.
dwight_schrute It's not the greatest one either...
jim_halpert But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
dwight_schrute And it's clear we're not going to carry them.
jim_halpert So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
dwight_schrute Exactly.
kevin_malone I think we're ready to give thi- Jim?
jim_halpert Is he OK?
dwight_schrute Yep. He'll be fine.
andy_bernard Surprise! Your new crew.
darryl_philbin Would you just fire me, man?
andy_bernard Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?
darryl_philbin You wanna make me happy? Huh?
andy_bernard Yeah.
darryl_philbin Give me your job.
andy_bernard Haha, what?
darryl_philbin I'll do it better than you. I earned it. I deserve it. I got passed over, God knows why, reasons I cannot and will not understand. The job was mine Andy, everyone said it was mine. Make me manager or fire me.
andy_bernard I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.
nate Also, Darryl, FYI, I already told this to Andy, but uh, you should probably know I technically don't have a hearing problem, it's just when there's a lot of noises...
andy_bernard Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?
darryl_philbin He died.
andy_bernard He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?
nate What wa-, what was the last...I'm havin' a-
andy_bernard None, no part of this has anything to do with you.
darryl_philbin I didn't have time because of my daughter.
andy_bernard Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.
darryl_philbin Hey I'm not gonna tell you this stuff if you gonna throw it back in my face.
andy_bernard Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed.
darryl_philbin OK.
andy_bernard OK what?
darryl_philbin OK, don't fire me.
andy_bernard Ah, OK.
darryl_philbin My future's not gonna be determined by seven little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls. I control my destiny. I do.
darryl_philbin I put some guys on tonight. Best of your bunch and my bunch. Tell you now though, it's gonna be mostly my bunch.
andy_bernard Yeah. That makes sense. OK. Good, alright.
kevin_malone Here...
andy_bernard What is goin' on?!
kevin_malone Oh hey guys.
darryl_philbin Why is the forklift in the wall?
andy_bernard Why is the truck empty?
dwight_schrute Uh, it's not totally empty.
darryl_philbin Is that grease on my floor?
dwight_schrute OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
darryl_philbin And did your brains tell you to ruin these boxes with grease?
kevin_malone OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
jim_halpert OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
darryl_philbin And?
erin_hannon And we did.
dwight_schrute I don't know.
erin_hannon Jim? Tell them what it's called.
jim_halpert That's alright.
kevin_malone No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
jim_halpert Doesn't matter what the name is. Señor Loadenstein, that's stupid.
kevin_malone Señor Loadenstein. Tell 'em why it's called that, Jim.
jim_halpert That's OK, we're good.
erin_hannon Jim...
andy_bernard No, Jim. Tell us why it's called Señor Loadenstein.
jim_halpert Porque es muy rapido.
dwight_schrute OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
darryl_philbin Let me see it.
dwight_schrute It's uh, it's in beta testing.
darryl_philbin Let me see it!
dwight_schrute Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
joe Erin, Jim & Kevin Uno! Dos! Tres!
phyllis_vance Yeah, I lost my client.
creed_bratton I already won the lottery. I was born in the US of A, baby. And as backup I have a Swiss passport.
toby_flenderson I would spend a lot of time launching my true crime podcast, The Flenderson Files. Dum bum buh. Flenderson files.
pam_beesly We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
jim_halpert Right. It's city and country combined.
pam_beesly Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.
jim_halpert And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
pam_beesly Just like now.
jim_halpert Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
pam_beesly Oh..
jim_halpert But what are you gonna do about that?
pam_beesly What are you gonna do?
