michael I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.
michael I have now memorized all of your names. Shirty, Mole, Lazy Eye, Mexico, Baldy.
michael And I turn it on and I say 'Prepare yourself for the Utica Chainsaw Massacre. '
karen How's Jim?
pam We're engaged.
karen Oh my God, I'm so happy for you!
pam Oh, wow, thank you!
michael You remember Holly? She used to work for HR? She's the love of my life. She just left. and I never got closure. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure.
pam . Okay, let's go.
oscar Two?
kevin I didn't eat lunch. I didn't eat all my lunch.
angela Hello, everyone. Oh, ice cream. Nice, Kevin. Looks good.
kevin It. yeah.
oscar Angela, you're more chipper than usual.
angela I am proud to announce that there is a new addition to the Martin family. She's hypoallergenic. She doesn't struggle when you try to dress her. She's a third-generation show cat. Her father was in 'Meet the Parents. ' Needless to say, she was very, very expensive.
meredith How much?
angela Seven thousand dollars.
creed For a cat? I could get you a kid for that.
oscar Where'd you get that kind of money?
angela I sold Andy's engagement ring on eBay.
kevin Wait, you didn't give it back?
angela He wouldn't have wanted that. Her name is Princess Lady!
meredith Seven grand?
angela Mm-hmm.
meredith I gotta see that little bitch.
angela I have something better than a picture. Come on.
oscar You have your cats on Nanny-Cam?
angela Yeah. I mean, I usually try to take leave when I get a new cat, but I'm out of vacation days. And this company still doesn't recognize cat maternity. I mean, when somebody has a kid, oh sure, take off a year.
meredith She's right. I had my second kid just for the vacation.
angela Right. Anyways. I just want to make sure Princess Lady is acclimating well. She means more to me than anyone.
kevin Any cat, you mean.
angela And person.
pam So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! I've been driving too long.
dwight What did you do?
kelly Stop yelling at me!
dwight What did you do?
kelly I didn't do anything!
dwight What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
jim Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
dwight Why don't you tell jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
kelly I was kickin' it.
dwight In juvie.
jim What?
dwight Juvie. nile. Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
jim Yep.
dwight For reha-
jim Got it.
dwight What did you do? Huh?
jim Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
dwight Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. What did you do?
kelly My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise, ' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
dwight I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
jim Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
kelly You did? I wanna see the cake.
jim And. ta da.
kelly I hate it.
jim How do you hate it? It's a cake.
kelly Well, there's no flowers. or toys. or--- I mean, there's nothing on it. Where did you even find a cake like this? I mean, it doesn't have my name on it! Do you guys know what my name is? My name is Kelly!
jim Right.
jim I forgot if there was an "e" between the "l" and the "y. " I still don't know.
kelly I mean, I don't even know what the theme is. What's the theme?!
jim Birthday.
dwight Frosting.
kelly Those aren't. themes. There's always a theme.
phyllis There's always a theme.
dwight Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
jim Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
pam Okay, a little bit more closer to the sign. Yeah.
michael Do I look okay?
pam You look good.
michael Hi.
receptionist Hi, can I help you?
michael Yes, you can. I am, uh, michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
receptionist Yes, we were expecting you. Have a seat.
michael Thank you. . Um. is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
receptionist Actually, she's on an HR retreat for the next three days.
michael Oh- She's not here?
receptionist But, if you need to get in touch with her immediately, you could talk to A. J. He's a salesman here.
michael A. J.
receptionist Yeah, he's her boyfriend. He's just over there.
michael She has a boyfriend.
pam I'm so sorry, Michael.
michael How could she do this to me, Pam?
pam She's not doing it to hurt you.
michael I can't do the presentation, I can't- . just. oh. thinking about seeing him. and. thinking about. him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God!
pam Listen, when jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-
michael I know, just. uh, please, I'm going through something, okay?
pam You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.
michael And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
pam Yeah, maybe.
michael 
pam Maybe. One step at a time.
michael 
pam You can do this.
michael I can do this.
oscar It could be snacks, or-
kevin Why would we-
oscar Wha-
kevin Is that what I think it is?
oscar Good God!
kevin 
oscar 
angela 
kevin That one ugly cat is humping Princess Lady!
angela No!
meredith Awesome!
angela Stop it, Mr. Ash! Bad cat! That is very bad! You stop it right now! I swear, he is fixed.
meredith Yeah, I know fixed; that ain't fixed.
kevin No way.
angela No, now listen. You can't let what you see here, sully your image of them. They are good, decent cats. I gotta go. I'll be back in an hour. Oh, stop that! Oh!
kevin Oh, the other one's watching.
jim Okay, so all we need is a theme. and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
dwight Busy!
jim Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
dwight Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
jim You know what? I could use a little help.
dwight You know what? I'm a little busy.
jim We have a lot to do, and you are. putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
dwight It's not effeminate. It's festive.
jim You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
stanley I know, I just read it on the sign. . push;
michael Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. about paper" and get them to "Show us the money!" Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name? A. J.
 A. J.
michael A. J. What kind of name is A. J. ? A. J.
 
michael What do you race cars? A. J.
 I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand.
michael Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A. J, are you dating? Is there somebody you date? A. J.
 Yeah. Why, are you interested?
woman I have a question about discounts from distributors.
michael Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um. is it serious? A. J.
 It's pretty serious, yes.
michael Huh- Does she ever talk about me?
pam Oh, God. A. J.
 Excuse me?
man What does this have to do with sales?
michael It's all connected. Shut up. Does she ever mention 'michael Scott?' A. J.
 No, what are you talking about?
michael Does it feel good? A. J.
 Does what feel good?
michael Your life. Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. Oh, wow. Ooh, okay.
pam Michael, get off the floor!
michael Yeah, yeah. uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
pam No, no, no, you have to do it-
michael No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. Okay. okay.
pam That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation. Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.
pam Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K. D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! Cutting down the competition.
angela Where is that bad cat? Oh, you know who you are. Excuse me, Petals, I'm looking for Mr. Ash. He's a bad cat. Bad, bad cat. Do you hear me? Bad. Yeah, you were bad. No, you look at me when I talk to you. Do you hear me, Mr. Ash? You look at me. 'Cause I'm talking to you right now.
oscar 
kevin 
angela 
kevin This is getting weird.
oscar Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue?
kevin Ohhh.
michael 
angela Has this been on the entire time?
oscar I have no idea.
kevin I was looking at pictures of food on my computer.
angela Well, sorry I'm late.
oscar I want to get that image out of my head. The psychological issues that go behind licking a cat, are not things I want to go into. Also, I'm pretty sure she coughed up a hairball.
pam Don't look up. Don't look up.
michael Want some pie?
pam No.
michael I went through Holly's things.
pam What?
michael I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
pam Oh, Michael.
michael I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael. "
pam You did what?
michael I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
pam She never sent it to you?
michael No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
pam No.
michael Yes.
pam No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.
michael How?
pam Because, she didn't send it to you!
michael I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
pam I could read it.
michael No, that wouldn't-
pam Yeah, I could read it.
michael No, you don't have to do that.
pam Go get your laptop.
michael Okay.
pam What? I'm not in love with her.
dwight You have to write my suggestions down, too.
jim I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt. " I don't even know what that means.
dwight It's in the name.
jim Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
dwight You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
jim Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
dwight Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord.
jim Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
dwight Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. What about you?
jim Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
dwight That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
jim Didn't see that one coming.
pam It's deleted.
michael Well?
pam She still has feelings for you.
michael She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
pam I can't tell you specifically, but. it's not over.
michael You're sure?
pam 
michael Okay.
kelly 
all Happy Birthday!
meredith Surprise!
dwight Hey, it's not a surprise.
jim Not a surprise.
kelly This doesn't look good.
jim What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
kelly 
dwight Told you.
jim You haven't heard our theme, though.
kelly You don't hear a theme, you see it. why is there a chicklet on my cake?
jim That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
dwight Our theme, if you will.
jim Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
dwight That's our theme.
kelly Cool.
jim Yeah?
kelly I love it.
dwight Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
kevin Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
dwight No.
jim No.
kevin Oh, then pick TV.
meredith Take a nap!
oscar TV.
kevin No, watching TV at work is really cool.
stanley Take a nap, nothing good is on TV right now.
creed Bonnie Hunt is on.
kelly You know what, I have been watching TV all week. I choose nap.
jim all right.
dwight Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
meredith Surprise.
dwight Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
jim Ahem. This is for you. and . Happy Birthday, Kel.
kelly Thank you.
dwight Okay, you've got one hour.
kelly I'm too excited to sleep.
dwight Mm, great cake.
jim Thanks.
dwight Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. Many happy returns.
michael I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.
pam No, we don't need to do that.
michael Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
pam You mean Tony?
michael Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
pam Oh, Michael.
michael Man, was he fat. So, so. fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
