erin Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. He's not available right now. Uh huh. Yes. Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
jim michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5
 00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about. ten minutes.
jim Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
pam I can do it.
dwight What do you need from me?
dwight Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
michael 
dwight Like clockwork.
jim Three, two, one.
michael Uh oh. What's so funny?
pam You had to be there.
michael Oh yay! Geography joke. Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
michael See you later!
dwight Bye Michael! Yeah!
jim All right, you ready for this?
pam Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
jim Yeah.
pam Okay.
jim Wait, should I have left the car running?
pam Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
jim Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
pam Tell them what happened last year.
jim I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
pam No, no, that guy who hit on me.
jim Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
pam Yeah, you don't grab these for balance.
jim Well.
dwight I'm gonna say 30.
rolph Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.
dwight Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
rolph Woah. Homemade?
dwight Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?
dwight rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
kevin Michael, isn't that Holly?
michael We're just friends. Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
holly Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
michael Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
holly All right.
michael All right. Mmhmm. Hey.
holly Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
michael A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
aj Hey Michael.
michael Hey. Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
holly Lemonade sounds great.
michael Okay.
aj I'd love an iced tea, actually.
michael You can go to hell. I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
michael I lied to Kevin. holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number
one "Holly, you and I are soup snakes. " The-and the reason is. because. in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. holly and I are soul mates.
charles Jim. Pam.
jim Hey, how are you?
pam Hey Charles.
charles Nice day, huh?
jim Yeah.
charles Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest.
jim I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
pam Do you want me to beat him up for you?
jim No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
dwight Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
jim Well, I could've died, so. I looked it up online afterwards.
dwight Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
andy Bro-migo, you think you could put erin on my row?
dwight Why? I don't understand.

andy Uh.

andy That's.

holly Um, not much.

holly I remember your chair pants idea.
aj I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
michael All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
holly Okay, yeah.
aj You guys are really gonna do this?

holly We could do Back to the Future.
michael Oh!
holly We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time. fix their parents.
michael Could we get a Delorean?
holly Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
michael Oh! Dun-der. Dun-der.

toby Really, really funny.
kendall Really funny.
dwight Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate.
oscar Settle down gentlemen.
pam Good game!
david Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
michael Uh, it's a sketch now.
david Okay, introducing Scranton's michael Scott performing with Nashua's holly Flax! I have not seen this.
michael And now, presenting.
both SlumDunder Mifflinaire!
michael 
holly Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
michael Yes, I am.
holly For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A. ) On easy street, B. ) a tour of Dartmouth College, C. ) they never met, D. ) brushing their teeth?
michael Ohh, I'm thinking. I'm going to say. B, tour of Dartmouth College.
holly That is correct! How did you know that?!
michael Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
holly Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
michael Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
holly I'm Robert Dunder.
michael I'm Robert Mifflin. Ah, okay.
holly Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A. ) A rope, B. ) a knife, C. ) a gun, D. ) brushing his teeth!
michael Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
holly That is correct!
michael Yes!
stanley I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
holly The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A. ) Scranton, B. ) Buffalo, C. ) Utica, or D. ) toothbrush!
michael I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
holly That is correct! man from
buffalo What is he talking about?
holly How did you know that?!
michael david Wallace told me!! woman from
buffalo David, is this true?
david Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today. man from
buffalo Are we losing our jobs or not, David?
holly They didn't know?
michael I guess not.
david I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the buffalo branch. woman from
buffalo And?
david We're- we're closing the buffalo branch. man from
buffalo You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it.
david How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
michael Well. I didn't know they didn't know.
david What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, "oh, this would be really funny. "
michael Thank you.
david Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, "is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?"
michael Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
meredith Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
dwight Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
pam How do you figure?
dwight Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
oscar Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
pam Let's do this.
andy Jim, come on!
charles Look who just woke up! I've been up for a while.
kevin It's six to six. It's a nail-biter.
angela Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
rolph Here's an accounting question for
you what does one fiance plus one lover equal?
answer one whore.
dwight Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
rolph What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-
dwight Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
rolph No way! You don't mean that!
dwight Rolph, leave it alone!
erin Yeah! Boo-yah!
pam I got it!
dwight Pam!
pam Oof!
jim You all right?
pam Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.
jim You sure?
pam Yeah.
jim Hey, easy, easy.
charles Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
pam No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
charles I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
david Yeah.
jim All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
charles Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
jim No, uh-
pam Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
charles Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
dwight Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
charles I guess that's it for you, Jim.
jim All right, you know what? Let's do this.
pam We'll be back!
dwight Oh man, I am so mad that pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! I'll get it.
michael Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
holly Hindsight.
michael Should've had hindsight.
holly How do you think it went before the buffalo thing?
michael I think it went well. I think it was good.
holly There weren't any laughs.
michael No, it was a tough audience.
holly Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
michael Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
holly Well, I'm glad we did it.
michael Me too. We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
holly I can't wait.
jim Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer. No, don't send in the subs yet. Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
nurse To be safe, we should do an x-ray.
pam How long will that take?
nurse Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant.
pam I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
nurse Oh good, because my next question was "do you have a game to get back to. "
holly What'd you think?
aj I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but.
michael Well you guys should hit the road before. I close down another branch.
holly Okay. So good to see you.
michael Good to see you. AJ.
aj Michael.
michael I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and. Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time. And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
david Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
charles Yeah, it looks like pam won't make it back. Okay?
dwight Okay. Fine.
charles All right! Come on.
dwight Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
andy Dwight.
dwight No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
david Dwight.
dwight Seven? Can I finish please?
david Okay.
dwight Eight?
jim Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes. Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back. Okay. Okay, great. Hey, Dwight, uh. send in the subs! Ohh!
