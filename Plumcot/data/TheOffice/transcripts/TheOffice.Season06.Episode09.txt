dwight_schrute Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?
stanley_hudson Thank you.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
andy_bernard Wow. H & H. You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?
dwight_schrute Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
phyllis_vance This is really nice Dwight, thanks.
andy_bernard Thanks.
dwight_schrute Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.
dwight_schrute Good morning Michael.
michael_scott Morning Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hungry?
michael_scott No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
dwight_schrute Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
michael_scott Well, yeah...
dwight_schrute You're thinking of deer pen1s.
michael_scott It worked.
dwight_schrute Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. Bagel?
michael_scott I don't mind if I do.
dwight_schrute K. I brought cheese too.
michael_scott I'm taking one for my lady friend.
dwight_schrute Excellent.
michael_scott Brain food. Thank you very much.
dwight_schrute Okay. You owe me.
dwight_schrute Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?
dwight_schrute Pam, would you care for a bagel?
pam_beesly Oh, no thank you.
dwight_schrute That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
pam_beesly I have an early lunch.
pam_beesly Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom. I don't know. I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go. No way out. No way out.
erin_hannon These are amazing. You took all these?
ryan_howard I've always found beauty in uncommon places. Homeless people. Graffiti. Photography lets me capture all that. Have you ever been photographed before?
erin_hannon Oh just by like friends.
ryan_howard Well here's what I've been doing around here. It's for a series on exposure in the workplace.
helene_beesly Whoohoo! Pammy?
pam_beesly Hey! Hey. Happy birthday.
helene_beesly Thank you.
michael_scott My girls. There they are.
michael_scott Birthday lunch. Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch. It'll cure all of your "Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother" and fixes all occurrences of "I don't really see them together". So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine. Take with food.
angela_martin Pam, aren't you going to introduce us to Michael's girlfriend?
pam_beesly I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.
michael_scott Yeah--
kevin_malone Hi.
michael_scott I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we?
helene_beesly Wait a minute. Is that another birthday present for me cause you already gave me a necklace.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God I love it.
helene_beesly Tell her how you gave it to me.
michael_scott No, that wouldn't be--
helene_beesly He put it around my neck while I was still asleep this morning. What a nice way to wake up.
michael_scott Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
kevin_malone Because of s*x?
michael_scott Hey--
pam_beesly Kevin!
michael_scott Please, Kevin. You're fired. Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?
pam_beesly Yes, let's go.
erin_hannon Oh, wait. Um-- Swartz Lumber is on the phone for you Pam and they say it's urgent.
pam_beesly Oh, you guys. Just one second. Oh my gosh! Are you serious? Shipping emergency. I don't think I can go to lunch.
jim_halpert Oh man, that's crazy. Right as we were on our way out too.
pam_beesly I know. Isn't that always how it goes?
jim_halpert Rarely. If ever. Let me give it a whirl. I'll talk to them.
pam_beesly I want to handle it.
jim_halpert That's okay.
pam_beesly I feel like its--
jim_halpert It's my pleasure. Hello? Well that's great. Turns out the paper was there all along.
creed_bratton Thank God.
creed_bratton Something's up. That paper was never supposed to arrive.
helene_beesly So, Pammy-- are you still liking sales?
pam_beesly Yeah-- it's exciting.
helene_beesly Well, you know-- Michael and I were-- talking, and maybe if you put a little more face to face time with your clients you could improve your sales.
jim_halpert Pam's sales are fine actually.
michael_scott Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
pam_beesly Thank you.
michael_scott Today is about family.
pam_beesly Why did I get in the car? I could of struggled. I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.
andy_bernard Oh, Dwight. I have a little surprise for you.
dwight_schrute Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
andy_bernard Yes! And I wanted to return the favor. I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.
dwight_schrute Wow--
andy_bernard Feel it against your cheek.
dwight_schrute I will.
andy_bernard You give me a gift-- Bam! Thank you note. You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP. You do me a favor-- Wham! Favor returned. Do not test my politeness.
dwight_schrute Let me get that door for you--
andy_bernard Whoa--
dwight_schrute There you go!
andy_bernard Thank you very much. Now I've got it for you.
dwight_schrute Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
andy_bernard Is that right?
dwight_schrute Observe.
andy_bernard Huh.
dwight_schrute Right?
andy_bernard That really works.
dwight_schrute Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay.
andy_bernard Hey-- oh, hold on a second. Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.
dwight_schrute And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
andy_bernard Whoa-- thank you very much. Oh boy.
dwight_schrute Thank you very much for that.
andy_bernard You are very welcome.
dwight_schrute Have a seat. Allow me.
andy_bernard Have a seat yourself.
dwight_schrute You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
andy_bernard Not necessary.
dwight_schrute No, no, no!
andy_bernard You didn't have to do that.
dwight_schrute Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.
michael_scott Hello. Scott. Table for four.
chloe Welcome Scott family. It'll be just a moment.
pam_beesly I use to love coming here. The chicken parm is good. Big part of my childhood. Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.
michael_scott What table should we take? So many to choose from.
jim_halpert Wow.
helene_beesly Oh my God!
michael_scott What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!
pam_beesly Michael, you did all this?
michael_scott Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
helene_beesly Well, thank you. All of you.
michael_scott Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
helene_beesly Oh you'll love it. You can have my guide books. I think I'm done with those really long plane rides.
michael_scott Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
pam_beesly So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?
helene_beesly Sticking with 49.
pam_beesly 49 again? That's nine years in a row. This is now our longest family tradition.
michael_scott That's funny.
helene_beesly Well, as long as you're running numbers Pam, then help me out with this one. Let's see your six months pregnant, but you've only been married for 30 days, so what does that add up to?
jim_halpert Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.
michael_scott You're 54 years old.
helene_beesly No. I'm 58.
michael_scott You're 58 years old?
helene_beesly Uh huh.
michael_scott Congratulations.
michael_scott The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle. If anything I am robbing the grave.
pam_beesly Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?
helene_beesly Oh, well I like Nana, but I also like the classic Grandma.
pam_beesly Please be Grandma.
jim_halpert Definitely Grandma.
pam_beesly I want you to be Grandma.
helene_beesly Oh, Michael what do you think? Grandma?
michael_scott That--
pam_beesly Yay, Grandma!
michael_scott Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?
pam_beesly Maybe.
michael_scott Helene?
helene_beesly Oh, oh no. I don't think so.
michael_scott I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?
helene_beesly Oh no, I think a triathlon is pretty much something I can rule out. It just-- doesn't interest me.
michael_scott So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done.
helene_beesly Hmm... I might have done it when I was younger, but now there's just other things I'd rather be doing, instead of running and jumping and swimming--
michael_scott Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
helene_beesly Oh--
michael_scott You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?
helene_beesly No, no...
michael_scott Snowboarding?
helene_beesly You want to go snowboarding?
michael_scott I might.
helene_beesly Michael, what are you talking about?
michael_scott Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
michael_scott Do I really want to go snowboarding? No. But I would like to if I wanted to.
andy_bernard Aye-yi-yi!
dwight_schrute What's going on in here?
oscar_martinez Andy bought lunch.
dwight_schrute Oh... no... really?
andy_bernard Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
dwight_schrute There is no book. There's only a survival guide.
andy_bernard You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
dwight_schrute Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
michael_scott So we should get the check?
pam_beesly What about your gift Michael?
michael_scott Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.
helene_beesly I'm sure I won't.
michael_scott Yes you will.
pam_beesly He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.
helene_beesly Gimme. Look at this wrapping paper. It's got the word love on it in every language.
pam_beesly Aww--
michael_scott I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.
helene_beesly A scrapbook of our first memories by Michael Gary Scott. For my girlfriend Helene on your birthday.
michael_scott That's just an arbitrary title.
helene_beesly Ok, there's a penny. What's that from?
jim_halpert Penny for your thoughts.
helene_beesly It was from the wishing well at the mall. You threw it in. I went back later, waded in and I found it.
jim_halpert Wow.
pam_beesly That's amazing.
michael_scott It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
helene_beesly A poem!
michael_scott Oh that I plagiarized I think.
helene_beesly I can not go to school today said little Peggy Ann McKay...
jim_halpert Shel Silverstein.
pam_beesly Yeah.
helene_beesly Um-- I have the measles and the mumps, a gash, a rash and purple bumps. And my teachers really mean-- Happy Birthday , I love you Helene.
pam_beesly That's really nice Michael.
helene_beesly I think it sucks.
helene_beesly I think it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful.
michael_scott Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.
helene_beesly God... it's a scrapbook.
pam_beesly Home run Michael.
jim_halpert You set the bar so high.
michael_scott That was a bunt.
andy_bernard Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this.
dwight_schrute Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered.
andy_bernard No, I insist.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.
andy_bernard Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
dwight_schrute Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.
pam_beesly Hey. Where'd you go?
michael_scott Oh, just went to the bathroom.
pam_beesly And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?
michael_scott I got thirsty.
pam_beesly Okay, weirdo. Come on. It's time for cake.
michael_scott Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly. And then I met Helene. And she is great and she already knows and has done everything that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it. But, I think I want to do those things myself.
pam_beesly Cakes really good.
helene_beesly Oh, I know. I love how they use butter cream frosting.
michael_scott Finish your cake, Helene.
helene_beesly Hmmm?
michael_scott I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
michael_scott Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much. But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.
pam_beesly Michael. Michael ,it's okay.
michael_scott No it's not.
pam_beesly I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy. And that makes me happy.
michael_scott Wow. That just-- you've really grown.
pam_beesly Well--
michael_scott Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
jim_halpert Okay, so--
michael_scott And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
pam_beesly Michael.
michael_scott It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer-- -- tility.
helene_beesly I, um-- I got it.
helene_beesly I'm 58. What am I supposed to do now?
michael_scott Well, hobbies--
jim_halpert Stop.
andy_bernard Ahh.
dwight_schrute What's going on?
andy_bernard Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.
dwight_schrute Alright, move it.
andy_bernard What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.
dwight_schrute Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
andy_bernard It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
dwight_schrute Got it. To Dwight. Wha-- Starbucks gift card.
andy_bernard Surprise! It's from everybody. $15 value.
dwight_schrute Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.
michael_scott Pamela Beesly Halpert--
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott May I have a word with you in my office please?
pam_beesly I am working.
michael_scott Well, this is a work related matter.
pam_beesly Really?
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly Really?
michael_scott Yes. Join me please, won't you? I am going to give you a raise.
pam_beesly Why?
michael_scott Because of all the good work you've done.
pam_beesly I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.
michael_scott That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.
pam_beesly I have the worst attitude of any person here.
michael_scott Do you want the raise or what?
pam_beesly Yeah, I'll take it.
michael_scott Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
pam_beesly You're bribing me?
michael_scott No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
pam_beesly I want to hit you.
michael_scott What?
pam_beesly I want to hit you. I'll do that.
michael_scott Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
pam_beesly No. Are you kidding?
michael_scott Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
pam_beesly No. I don't think I can hit you in the office.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly So, um... we'll do it after work. In the parking lot. In front of everyone. I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly See you then.
michael_scott See you.
ryan_howard Hey.
michael_scott Hey.
ryan_howard Quick question.
kelly_kapoor Yeah.
ryan_howard Are you scared?
michael_scott Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--
ryan_howard We heard about the punch.
michael_scott What punch?
kelly_kapoor Pam. She's going to punch the crap out of your face after work.
michael_scott I'm pretty sure we said slap.
kelly_kapoor No, it's a punch and Pam has that crazy pregnancy strength now.
ryan_howard I'm getting concerned that you don't seem to understand what's going to happen. Do you?
michael_scott I-- mmm-- I'm good.
ryan_howard alright. See you there.
michael_scott Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
jim_halpert Inappropriate.
michael_scott I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
jim_halpert All the time.
michael_scott Really?
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott She strong?
jim_halpert She wants it bad Michael.
michael_scott Can you stop this?
jim_halpert I can.
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert And I don't support her choice to hit you.
michael_scott I don't either.
jim_halpert But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.
michael_scott Mmm-hmm. I know.
jim_halpert I just need some time.
michael_scott You gotta do something--
jim_halpert I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.
michael_scott How much time do you think you'll need?
jim_halpert No more than a week. Maybe two weeks.
michael_scott Come on, man!
toby_flenderson Pam, can I talk to you for a second?
pam_beesly Oh...
toby_flenderson I heard about the hit. Just-- make sure it's off company property, right?
pam_beesly Right.
toby_flenderson Okay, I think we should probably be okay.
pam_beesly Okay.
toby_flenderson Okay. And-- the-the power-- comes from the back foot. So its-- its all one motion through the-- body. So you stay a little low and there's a twist. You keep your shoulder down and you kind of throw out the arm. Pow!
pam_beesly Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.
toby_flenderson Yes.
pam_beesly Okay.
toby_flenderson Yes.
pam_beesly Wow!
toby_flenderson Okay.
meredith_palmer Hey everybody, he's not in the men's room although the seat was warm so we may have just missed him.
kevin_malone My money's on Pam.
oscar_martinez It's not a fight. What other outcome could there be?
kevin_malone Michael could win.
oscar_martinez How? He can't hit back.
kevin_malone Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
michael_scott Am I scared of getting hit in the face? No. Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege. I'm scared I'm gonna love it. Let's do this.
michael_scott It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.
kevin_malone We're here for the show, Michael.
michael_scott You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
kelly_kapoor It has almost no calories.
pam_beesly Are you ready?
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly You have to keep your hands down, Michael.
michael_scott I know. Okay. Alright. Oh-- God!
pam_beesly Michael, you have to put your hands down.
angela_martin Put your hands in your pockets.
michael_scott Okay! Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
pam_beesly What are you sorry for?
michael_scott So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
pam_beesly How about for dating my mom?
michael_scott Maybe that--
pam_beesly And dumping her on her birthday.
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.
michael_scott Okay. I promise. For the record your mom came on to me.
phyllis_vance Holy crap.
pam_beesly Are you okay?
michael_scott No!
pam_beesly You're okay.
jim_halpert Feel better?
pam_beesly No. You were right.
dwight_schrute Wait, why are you limping?
michael_scott I don't know.
dwight_schrute Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
michael_scott As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes. And guess what? I have four kids. And I have a hover-car and a hover-house. And my wife is a runner and it shows. And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together. And I am happy and I am rich and I never die. It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.
michael_scott Ahh...
dwight_schrute Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down.
michael_scott Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.
dwight_schrute Fire Jim.
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.
michael_scott What are you talking about--
dwight_schrute Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.
michael_scott Forget that.
dwight_schrute Can I have an office?
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.
michael_scott Oh that feels better.
