dwight Merry Christmas!
pam Merry Christ-- NO! Why. why did you bring that here?
dwight Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
pam Dwight, what uh.
dwight I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
pam Well, get it out of here.
dwight Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
jim Merry Christmas Dwight.
dwight Jim.
jim Wow. What have we got here?
dwight What does it look like?
jim Dead goose.
dwight And circle gets the square.
jim All right.
dwight So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
toby Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.
dwight No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
dwight Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
dwight He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
jim Wow. Win-Win.
dwight Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
phyllis I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?
creed That's crazy. It's crazy.
toby Dwight, you cannot keep that here.
dwight Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
toby Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.
dwight It's Christmas Toby.
toby It's a dead animal in an office. You can't.
dwight Toby.
toby I'm sorry.
dwight Please? Please?
toby Clean it in your car.
pam I would like it off my desk.
dwight Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
michael Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa la la la la la la la la. 'Tis the . ack. Hey! I would like a nice slice of Christmas Pam. Side of candied Pams. And perhaps, some Pam-chops, with mint.
pam Can I help you, Michael?
michael I'm looking for the toy drive box.
pam It's behind you.
michael OK. Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
jim Wow. What kind of bike is that?
michael Umm. I don't know? Average kind?
kevin The tires look pretty worn.
michael Well, that is probably from the test drive.
jim But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
michael No.
andy Yo, Michael, sweet ride Mike.
michael Oh, thanks.
pam Michael?
michael Yes? Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
pam I didn't, it's from corporate.
michael OK. Did everybody get one of these?
pam Yup.
michael Terrific. Good.
michael This is going to be the best Christmas ever. My girlfriend carol is coming to our party tonight, and I have a little surprise for her. I've got two tickets to paradise! Pack your bags, we're leaving the day-after-tomorrow! Um, taking her to Sandals, Jamaica, all-inclusive. All-inclusive. You know what that means? Right? Yeah.
jim Oh, I think you're supposed to put a toy in the box, Creed.
creed And a happy holiday to you.
jim Carol.
carol Hi, is michael around here?
michael There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde.
carol Michael.
michael Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
carol What?
michael Turn around, turn around. Come on.
carol Get outta here.
michael No, you get outta here.
andy michael
michael Yes.
andy If I may say. She's even prettier that you described her.
dwight Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
michael Thank you.
carol I really need a moment alone with you.
michael Not as much as I need a moment alone with you. Berp.
carol What is this?
michael That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
carol No. See, we never went on a ski trip.
michael I know.
carol I went on a ski trip.
michael Right.
carol Two years ago with my kids and my ex-husband.
michael Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart.
carol Michael.
michael And next to your kids. What?
carol This is so weird.
michael I don't understand?
jim It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. Is bold the right word?
carol I think you're a really sweet guy.
michael OK
carol But, um, I don't know how to deal with, with this thing . And, and the proposal. And I don't think things are going to work out with us.
michael No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
carol What are you talking about?
michael I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
carol Oh, no. Michael.
michael And it's all inclusive.
carol Michael.
michael Yes.
carol I'm sorry.
michael No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
carol I know.
pam Psst. Jim. Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.
jim What?
pam For the past few months I've been sending dwight letters from the CIA.
jim Are you serious?
pam They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.
jim Last year, my boss, michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
pam So. here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. Sorry I didn't wrap it.
jim You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?
pam Oh.
jim No, because of the promotion.
pam Oh yeah.
jim It just feels a little bit, like.
pam No, I get it, of course. OK.
jim I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do, then . what am I doing?
michael I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.
stanley You can't cancel a holiday.
michael Keep it up stanley and you will lose New Year's.
stanley What does that mean?
michael Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
pam Michael, what's going on?
michael carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
jim Will they still air 'Rudolph?'
kevin That's not fair.
dwight Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
michael Fine! Have your party. Just no guests.
phyllis But we invited guests.
michael Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
michael Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.
pam I know.
michael It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
pam OK, well, why are you laying like that?
michael Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
pam Like what?
michael Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
pam Well. um I, I don't.
michael And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
pam I don't need to know.
dwight Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
michael Take it from Toby.
dwight Copy.
michael Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
pam No, thank you.
michael It's all. OK.
toby Hey Dwight. Pretty nice robe- Why?
angela Phyllis, I need you to pick up green streamers at lunch.
phyllis I thought you said green was whorish.
angela No, orange is whorish.
karen Uh, so I had a couple of ideas to make the Stamford people feel more at home. Each year we have a Christmas raffle . .
angela It would never work here.
karen Ok . um, another idea was karaoke .
angela No.
karen A Christmas drinking game .
meredith Yes.
angela God help you.
karen What?
angela These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas. " I think you should leave.
karen You're kidding.
angela You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. Please. Thank you. OK, thank you very much.
michael What are you doing?
dwight We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
andy Hey, what's the haps?
michael Carol?
dwight Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box.
dwight Why don't you just buy the whole song?
michael I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just. I just want a little taste of it.
dwight Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final. How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. carol is one smart cookie.
michael Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.
michael This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.
pam I feel like I've been kinda cold to karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.
pam Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.
karen Yeah, right? I'm so glad you said that. Because, I don't know how those meetings usually go.
pam Um, usually like that.
karen Does anyone ever stand up to angela or. ?
pam I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face.
karen Right.
pam Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.
karen Oh cool, yeah.
pam That could really be fun.
karen Oh, thank you.
pam You guys do a raffle?
karen Yeah, we do a raffle.
toby Hey Kev.
kevin Hey.
angela This should've been up yesterday.
phyllis It'll be all right.
angela What is that? The "Committee to Plan Parties invites you to a margarita-karaoke Christmas?" There's no such thing as the "Committee to Plan Parties. "
pam There is now. We just started it.
angela Well, you just can't start a committee. You have to have funding.
karen What's your funding?
angela Two hundred dollars.
pam What's ours again?
karen Umm, two hundred and one dollars.
pam Oh right.
kelly Hey, a margarita-karaoke Christmas party, that sounds like fun.
angela No, that is not a party. There's only one party and it's hosted by the Party PLANNING Committee and it starts at three o'clock.
kevin Then why are there two flyers?
karen Oh, I understand that this is confusing for everyone, let me explain. There's a party that starts at three.
kevin Right.
karen And then there's a way more fun party that starts at two forty-five.
pam Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer.
kevin I didn't see where it was.
jim Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?
karen I think that's a really good option.
dwight pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
pam You can't do that.
dwight As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
andy Umm. I'm number three.
dwight You're number four.
andy Yeah, but I'm number three.
dwight Ah, no. You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
jim OK, I think I can help here.
dwight Ok, good
jim As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.
dwight OK, this is stupid.
jim Could you please keep it down? I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid.
dwight No no, no, wait, wait, wait Permission to join the Validity Committee.
jim Permission denied.
dwight Damn it!
andy Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. C'mon, my treat.
michael All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
andy That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.
michael Hooters?
andy No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too.
michael Ah, I need my entourage Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
ryan Ah man, I can't.
michael Why not?
ryan I'm not feeling so well. I've got a ton of work to do here. MSG allergy, peanut allergy, I just ate there last night.
michael Ok, feel better.
ryan Thanks.
michael C'mon Jim, let's go.
jim OK. Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
ryan Doctor appointment, car trouble, plantar warts, granddad fought in World War II. Use your head, man. I keep mine in here. Look alive, Halpert. Welcome back.
michael Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then . and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.
andy So she looks really hot, so I said, "You look hotter than usual today. " Thank you. michael Head of the table.
dwight Get out Jim. Actually, um. Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
michael Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.
andy So she looks at me right, and she goes, "I'm sorry, don't I even know you?" After a year, a year of buying lattes from her, do you believe that?
jim Yes.
dwight I can't. I can't here what you're saying.
michael carol used to drink lattes.
dwight What're you talking about?
michael She would get this little foam mustache.
dwight carol had a mustache?
michael And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny.
dwight What are you guys talking about?
michael She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
dwight Michael! Repeat what you said louder! . push;
dwight It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for michael if I'm here for Michael?
michael I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out.
andy No.
dwight Who are you calling?
michael I'm just gonna call her.
andy Put that away. Put that away. S. O. S. We. I. May day. Haha. man down over here, we need your help.
waitress What can I get for 'ya?
andy I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes.
andy One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
phyllis You should, you should put out salt for the rims
pam That's a great idea.
angela Phyllis?
phyllis I was just getting a snack.
pam You can have your snack in here.
angela Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
phyllis OK.
kevin I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
ryan I miss the days when there was only one party I didn't want to go to.
roy So I only use three?
pam If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.
roy OK. And where to do you get all those cool bows?
pam Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.
roy OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
pam Oh yeah, your mom would love that.
roy Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later.
pam Bye.
karen He's cute. You should date him.
pam Oh, yeah. Maybe.
dwight Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
chef No, it's Usuba.
dwight Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
chef Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity.
dwight Nah, I don't know. Still think Nakiri's better. Woman at
bar I think he'd know.
michael Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.
andy Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?
cindy I don't know.
michael Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.
andy You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. Watch, watch, watch, watch. Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?
michael You're right. That's good.

pam I got goose bumps.
angela I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So. yeah. I'm pretty good.

jim Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm. OK, it's pretty much the same thing.
kelly What d'ya think?
stanley Fruity and delicious.

roy You don't know?
kevin Dude, you should know.
michael Yeah. well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
michael I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?
michael Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her. Second

cindy No. I have school.
michael You want help? OK. Merry Christmas. Second
cindy Merry Christmas.
dwight Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed.
michael That waitress was the one.
jim No. She wasn't.
michael How can you be sure?
jim Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately three hours ago.
michael Don't make fun. You're making fun of me.
jim Sorry.
michael I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
jim You what?
michael I, I put a mark on her arm. So I could tell them apart. I don't. I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
jim Yeah.
michael Oh, why do I feel like crap?
jim You just had a rebound.
michael I had rebound? Yeah.
jim Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
michael I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.
angela Little baby, parum pum pum pum. I am a poor boy too, parum pum pum pum. I have no gift to bring, parum pum pum pum. That's fit to give our King, parum pum pum pum.
michael Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive.
angela . Shall I play for you, parum pum pum pum
oscar Too soon.
angela I played my drum for Him, parum pum pum pum. I played my best for Him, parum pum pum pum, Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum.
dwight pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
dwight Bye Pam.
pam Night.
jim Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.
pam We should get him a bus ticket. To make his trip easier.
jim Oh no, that would be great.
pam It costs seventy five dollars.
jim Hmm. Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?
pam Ohh.
dwight What the? "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone. " Destroy phone?
