michael Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And. I'm. pretty nervous about it. And. I'm. making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this
way when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star. or any number of drag queens.
eric Hi -
computron Hello, eric Ward. Welcome to Dunder Mifflin. I am Computron, your answer to everything.
eric Hello.
michael I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
computron Yes.
michael What is the world's largest ocean?
computron Calculating. Calculating. Pacific!
michael Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
andy Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
michael That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.
pam Hello.
computron The NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1972.
pam Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
pam It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
michael Hello, Stanley. Fake
stanley Hi.
pam For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley. although, I get it.
eric Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I'm here.
michael Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -
eric Right.
michael - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
eric Yeah.
michael They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
computron Mul Yam in Tel Aviv is better.
michael No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
computron Are you calling me wrong?
michael Oh, my God.
eric It's called 'due diligence'. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I'm a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.
michael Alright. Excuse me. If you will -
ryan Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
michael - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.
dwight Oh, we will. Have a seat.
michael I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
eric So, um, the manager, michael Scott. is a bit of a character.
dwight He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
toby What are, are you doing at my desk?
dwight Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
toby Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.
dwight Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. Welcome.
toby Sorry. Hey, toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
eric Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?
toby What do you mean?
eric Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits.
toby Um. nothing comes to mind.
eric So, the staff?
toby Mm-hmm.
eric Are people generally happy?
toby Happy's a funny word.
eric In what way?
toby You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
eric So. generally?
toby Yes.
eric Generally.
toby Generally happy.
eric Generally happy.
eric What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that?
toby Oh, I don't know.
eric You, you don't know.
toby I don't know.
eric You're the head of Human Resources.
toby I don't know. No.
eric Ok. . push;
toby I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
michael Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?
toby Well, Eric's just going over some stuff.
michael Stuff. I love stuff.
toby It's, uh, it's HR stuff.
michael HR stuff? HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley. What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
eric It's uh, it's a company evaluation form.
michael Ah.
eric Talkin' bout, uh -
michael Talkin' bout, uh, what?
eric Waste is next.
michael Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
eric No, waste of time and resources.
michael Oh, time and resources.
toby Look, you know, in any company there's going to be certain degrees -
michael No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever.
eric Is anyone near retirement age?
eric Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So. well, I think I'm gonna be here for awhile.
michael This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. Right? Would you agree with that?
toby Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
michael That's, that is true.
dwight Thank you, so much.
kevin Thank you.
angela Thank you.
eric Thank you. It's nice to meet you all.
pam Good to meet you.
angela Have a great day.
dwight Hope to see you soon.
kevin Yeah.
michael I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of. or Pam. or Kevin?
michael I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
