dwight Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. "Scranton Mimeograph Corp?" I don't think we're doing business with them any time soon. That's odd. A letter from Robert Dunder. "A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance. " The Holy Grail.
pam
 Did you send dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail?
jim I think I'm a little too busy these days to s--- Oh , my God. I did send dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
jim The Dunder Code! I completely forgot about that prank. That had to be like six or seven years ago. Stayed late every night for a month. Had a lot more free time back then.
kevin I don't get it.
dwight Aha! A lightbulb.
kevin A lightbul--
dwight A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. Invisible ink.
kevin Whoa.
dwight "Higher than numbers go. " The ceiling above accounting!
angela Dwight! Down, Dwight! Dwight!
jim
 Man, I wish I was there to see his face when he gets to the end .
jim . and finds the. fake grail? No grail?
pam You don't remember?
jim I don't.
dwight An "X. "
oscar Annex. It must open something in the annex.
dwight Oh.
kevin Whoa.
dwight "Sedes introiti. " Seat of entrance.
dwight 
pete What?
oscar What?
kevin That's a flush.
all 
all The warehouse.
pam There's nothing down here.
jim Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.
dwight Let's just forget it. Forget it.
nellie So, how are we getting on with our grand social media initiative?
erin Well, we created a fake profile for a really cool guy named Derek McBlack.
nellie Wow.
erin It's just pete in sunglasses.
nellie Oh.
erin And then we had him "Like" Dunder Mifflin.
pete Then we created a bunch of fake friends for Derek, and we had all of them "Like" Derek's "Likes. "
erin So far, we're only popular with imaginary people, but we think this is the start of something big.
nellie You two are geniuses. And I am a genius putting you two together.
erin all right.
erin pete and I work well together -- not that there's anything special about Pete. It could be any guy. or girl-- not that I'm into girls. Not that I'm into Pete. Ugh! What was the question?
jim Hey. Co-
worker Hey Jim. Peter Rowley at Bridgeport Capital requested a meeting at lunch.
jim Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later. Co-worker #2
 Uh sure. No problem.
jim Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right?
dwight Pfft, "Athlead"? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? jim should just call it "Stumpany, " for "Stupid Company. "
darryl Nothing stupid about working for yourself. Hanging out with pro athletes, getting free tickets to the games. That's why I'm doing it.
dwight You're working for "Stumpany" too?
darryl Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over.
dwight What?
darryl Yep.
dwight Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing darryl too. When will it end?
jim Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
dwight You won't stop until you've poached us all.
jim Yeah. Even you.
dwight No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me.
jim Bye, Dwight.
jim Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.
pam Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?
kevin Ooh, I haven't heard it. So, what about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural? Potato?
pam Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.
angela I have no information. But I'm sure as soon as they know, they'll call you.
pam Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I'm just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let's be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?
pam Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital.
oscar Aw.
pam Hey, Cece, Daddy's gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?
cece Yeah.
pam Let's call him.
jim Hey. I was just about to call you.
pam Hey, Hon, are you close?
jim I am still in Philly, actually.
pam What?
jim It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board.
pam Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it.
jim Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.
cece I want Daddy.
jim You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
pam Of course.
jim Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?
pam Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.
jim Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you're not the best with the phone.
pam I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we're getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, "Bye, Daddy. "
cece Bye, Daddy.
jim Bye. Yep. See, you've still got to press "End, " Pam.
cece Press "End. "
pete Oh, check it out. This is our first real "Like. "
erin Oh, my gosh!
pete Oh! all right, Alan Olson from North Dakota. He also likes Hammermill and Georgia Pacific.
erin Wow. That guy's really into paper.
pete Yeah.
nellie Well done, you two.
erin We did it. Youth task force forever.
pete Yes.
pete Bap, bup, bup, bap. Wait. Did I go first and then you?
erin No, you go -- okay.
pete all right, all right. Okay, start over.
nellie Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man. "Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously. " I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
dwight Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
all 
dwight You're welcome.
phyllis Wait. This says "Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge"?
dwight This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
oscar "Loyalty pledge"?
darryl Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
dwight Yeah, we'll see about that.
dwight Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on darryl since he started working for jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? "Infuriating, irresponsible".
clark They got us set up with Windows 95, so you're kind of dreaming here.
dwight Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.
dwight customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?
kevin Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches.
dwight Not even close. Mr. romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client. Mr.
romanko I wouldn't say a rage.
darryl Mr. Romanko, we were a day late on one of your deliveries, but two of our trucks were down for repairs. It's very unlikely it would happen again. Mr.
romanko Thank you. Thank you.
dwight No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? L--
darryl Loyalty.
dwight Loyalty.
nellie Loyalty is exactly right.
dwight Thank you.
nellie Yes. I mean, it is everything. Let's all ask ourselves, have we been faithful in our relationships?
stanley That's none of your damn business.
nellie darryl is "dating" Dunder Mifflin.
darryl darryl is dating Val. still.
nellie But he's flirting with Jim's company on the side. And we all know what flirting can lead to. Mr.
romanko I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here?
dwight Yes.
nellie I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
dwight Yeah.
nellie So is it all right for her to flirt with Creed, for example?
creed Let's try it out.
nellie No, let's-- let's-- let's not say Creed. Let's say Mr. X.
angela Well, I think it would be immoral for erin to cheat on Andy.
erin Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you cheat on Andy?
angela Yes. And he didn't like it.
phyllis Does Mr. X know that erin has a boyfriend, or did erin keep that from Mr. X?
kevin Okay, this is really hard to follow. Can we just say pete because that's the guy that Erin's flirting with? Dance
teacher Ladies and gentlemen, the Little Ladybug Ballerinas.
ballerinas One, two, three. Parent in
audience Really?
pam Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
ballerinas One, two, three.
pam Hello? Yes, this is pam Halpert. I got the mural? Oh, my God!
audience Shh!
pam Um, I'm sorry. I have to go. My daughter's a ladybug. I know that doesn't make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you. Parent in audience #2
 You're very rude. Parent in audience #1
 Yes, very rude.
pam Shh! Kids are dancing. . push;
dwight Thank you so much for coming. darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. So, should we go call jim and tell him to go screw himself?
darryl Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
dwight It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
darryl It can.
dwight Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
phyllis Well, Andy's cute, but he's too vanilla, whereas pete - he's just one sick dude. I mean, you know this guy likes to get weird.
erin I'm just gonna say this one more time. pete and I haven't done anything.
meredith Yeah right. With slammin' bods like that, they ain't playing checkers.
oscar People, it's 2013. erin is a strong, independent woman. Who says she has to end up with any man?
erin Okay, can everyone please stop speaking for me? Andy is my boyfriend. pete and I are just friends. And that's the end of it. Right, Pete?
pete That is correct. Come on, guys, where is this even coming from?
kevin Your feelings for Erin? Probably your heart. and a little bit your pen1s.
all 
erin Nellie, you have to shut down the task force. I'm not sure if you need to start a new task force to do that, but please just shut down the task force.
nellie I suppose that will-- that will be all right, yeah.
nellie Most relationships eventually die on their own, but sometimes they just need a little pillow over the face. You're welcome, Andy. And you're welcome, my own ass.
investor Listen, I appreciate you taking the time with me. Co-
worker Peter, please. We completely understand your concerns here. Let us just show you the latest projections. Jim?
jim Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
jim Oh, actually. uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second.
pam Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. cece did great, and I want to tell you something.
lonnie Hey boss, you gotta jump on a delivery.
darryl I don't do that anymore.
lonnie That's what they told me.
darryl 
darryl all right, let's get this over with.
dwight You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! Here we go! Yeah!
dwight Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
darryl How far is this place?
dwight Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports.
darryl Fun.
toby Hey, really nice job in that meeting in there.
nellie Oh, thank you. I don't know, I sort of thought--
toby So proud of you, Hon.
nellie Oh, I don't know. Okay.
toby I'm just curious though, what do you have against pete and Erin?
nellie Well, Andy wrote me a really nice recommendation letter for the adoption agency, and I-- I just sort of felt I owed him one.
toby Pete's a pretty cool guy, though, and Andy was a terrible lover to Erin. He basically ignored her and left on a boat.
nellie I didn't really think about it like that.
toby Yeah, well. Not everybody has what we have.
nellie "What we have"?
toby Mm-hmm.
nellie I just remembered. I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
dwight Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
darryl They have fast food in Philly.
dwight Not like this.
darryl Exactly like this. Fast Food
worker And your milkshake.
dwight Thank you.
darryl It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?
dwight Nope. Fire in the hole! Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!
dwight Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
darryl You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
dwight It's a youtube thing! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming.
pam Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital?
angela Oh, I would love to, but I am swamped. with that .
oscar I'll watch it. Let's get this over with.
pam all right, you don't have to.
kevin Let's get this over with, Pam.
pam Okay.
oscar Oh.
pam Wait. What?
pam Excuse me, I have to get back to work.
pam Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.
oscar User error. I've heard of that happening to other people.
angela Oscar, don't rub it in. I'm sure pam is already kicking herself for choosing a phone call over her child.
pam Well, it was an important phone call.
pam I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, "Beesly!" I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- "Beesly!"
pete Hey.
erin Hello, Peter.
dwight It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
darryl You missed a spot. Drive Thru
customer Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!
dwight Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
nellie I am sorry that was so awkward for you two in that meeting. But I am going to have to reassemble the youth task force.
erin Oh, no, I really don't think that's a good idea.
nellie Well, that is not your call. I made the decision. You have no choice in the matter, and everybody knows it.
pete Well, okay, then.
erin I guess we don't have a choice.
nellie Nope.
pete yeah.
erin Yeah.
toby Lady. you never stop surprising me.
dwight 
darryl 
dwight What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
darryl No. I was clearing my throat.
meredith Good night.
pam Night
creed Night
pam Night, Creed.
pam Hey.
jim Hey.
pam So, how's it going?
jim We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it.
pam I'm so sorry.
jim I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
pam Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard.
jim Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.
pam Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.
jim You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?
pam No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.
jim Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
pam Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.
jim Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.
pam Is there-- um. you want to ease up a little bit?
jim Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it.
pam I don't know, jim -- maybe you should have been there.
jim You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this.
pam You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --
jim Pam, I'm not explaining this to you-- Pam, I'm not going over this again. Co-
worker Jim. We need you.
jim I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week to bring home something.
pam I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.
jim I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?
pam Yep.
jim We'll talk tomorrow?
pam Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
jim Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
pam Bye.
brian Hey, you okay?
pam What am I doing wrong, Brian?
brian Nothing. You're doing the best you can.
cameraman Brian.
brian Give her a minute. Give her a minute.
pam 
brian Hey, it's just a tough situation, all right?
pam It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard.
brian Yeah. Let's turn the cameras off. Seriously, guys. Enough. Enough.
pam Thank you.
guy Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!
darryl 
guy I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah.
darryl And replay.
guy Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah.
darryl I'm gonna miss the paper business.
