dwight What is this?
jim Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
dwight You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours?
jim Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
dwight Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
jim I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
dwight Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my --
stanley Eh.
phyllis I'm sorry. It's the largest one I have.
stanley I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat.
phyllis This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is "Nights in Morocco". This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
michael Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
phyllis Yes.
michael Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
phyllis Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
angela It's the nativity scene.
phyllis Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer.
angela I am not going to judge phyllis for desecrating Christmas. There is one person who will though and phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
phyllis I need you to get rid of the tree.
angela But--
phyllis Thank you.
phyllis Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
jim Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
dwight These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil.
dwight Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.
catchphrase "My horn can pierce the sky". Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit. Isn't that right princess?
jim That's the Christmas spirit.
dwight I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has s*x with a unicorn? Man with a horn has s*x with a royal horse?
jim Yes.
michael Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.
dwight They are now.
michael Cool. My horn can pierce the sky.
michael This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
meredith Oh. my. GOD!!! Hit me again.
michael Alright. One more time around the block.
jim I will grant you one wish.
pam I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
jim Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. Dumb.
andy Hey, hey. Ange. check it out. There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance.
angela Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
andy There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
michael Jim, Jim. .
jim What is it?
michael That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice. ka.
jim Wow, that is delicious.
michael Yeah.
jim Can't believe no ones thought of that.
michael I know.
meredith Ahh yeah!!
meredith Belly dancing! guy buying
doll 120, 180. 200.
dwight All right.
guy Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.
dwight Oh, so glad I could help.
guy Thanks.
dwight Merry Christmas.
guy You too.
dwight Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
michael Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.
jim Oh, oh, oh, oh!
dwight We got a live one! On fire!!
meredith I'm all right. I'm all right.
andy Sorry.
oscar We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
michael Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
oscar What about February 2nd?
jim Ah. would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
michael No, no. I celebrate privately.
jim That's cool.
michael Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
oscar Now? It's our Christmas party.
michael We'll do it quickly.
jim Well what if we can't do it quickly.
michael What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
oscar Do you know how to do an intervention?
michael Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
michael An intervention. It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together. it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop.
phyllis It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
angela I don't--
phyllis And napkins. fanned.
michael Okay, how do you feel?
meredith A little better. I threw up.
michael Uck. T. M. I.
kevin Fire girl. Too soon?
jim Yeah.
michael Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
toby Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
michael I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
meredith I'm not an alcoholic.
michael Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
dwight Aye.
michael The aye's have it.
meredith I don't care what everyone thinks. I know I am not an alcoholic.
michael Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we?
andy When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me Ace. It was totally awesome. Got straight B's. They called me Buzz.
michael Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
meredith Sure.
michael Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
meredith Obviously.
michael Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
oscar Where did you get this?
michael I got it on a website, that's not important.
toby Michael, We should contact some experts. You don't know what your doing.
michael Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?
kelly Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
michael Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better. Yes, Kevin.
kevin Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool.
michael That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
kevin Yeah, you said affected by it. Thanks again, Meredith.
meredith You're welcome.
michael Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?
dwight No, I like Meredith. . push;
dwight Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
michael Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
meredith I am fine.
michael Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
meredith I know I drink. I like to party
michael I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
meredith I am not an alcoholic!
michael You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.
phyllis I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
angela Please stop making me do these things.
phyllis Oh, sorry, it's your job.
angela But it's the season of mercy.
phyllis You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
angela I lost it.
phyllis Ok. nice.
meredith I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction. I do. To p0rn.
michael Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow. ? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
dwight I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
dwight There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
michael Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
dwight Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
michael Dwight--
dwight She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
michael . okay.
dwight I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
jim Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
dwight Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
creed I can get you one in an hour.
dwight Really?
toby Okay you know, this-- this is over.
stanley I agree.
jim Michael, I think. you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
michael Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
michael You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.
jim They've been in there for 45 minutes.
pam I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now.
phyllis That's a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan.
stanley Mmmm. chewy.
jim Hey.
andy What's up?
jim Do you take requests?
andy Sure.
jim Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
michael I'll be down in a minute. Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
toby Sure. Wow. Ow.
meredith We just missed Poor Richards.
michael We did?
meredith Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
michael Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.
meredith The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's.
michael We could go there, sure.
meredith . Brixx's, Carmen's.
michael Yes, yes.
meredith . The Fort, andy Gavin's.
michael I have a new place.
meredith Well, it must have just opened up.
michael It-- yep, recently.
meredith Yeah. all right.
michael All right.
meredith Enough of this Christmas crap. Let's get some party music. Yeah!
michael Yeah, oh there you go.
meredith Yeah!
michael That's good.
meredith Yeah that's better.
michael We're party girls.
toby Hey Sasha, it's daddy. Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
sasha Daddy, daddy, daddy!!
toby No, No, No. No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
toby This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
dwight $200.
darryl Yo.
toby Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
dwight Oh, that's my last one.
toby Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
darryl Thanks man.
toby I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
dwight Not my problem.
toby But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll. I-- I'm-- I'm begging you. I just-- I need it more than anything in this world. I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
darryl All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400.
toby I only have $200.
darryl You can owe me.
toby Oh man, thanks, thank you, thank you, thank you.
darryl I know, right. Merry Christmas.
toby Oh thanks. She's gonna. oh.
darryl Something wrong with the doll?
toby No. It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
meredith Sunrise Rehab? No! No! No! I told you no! There is no way!
michael It's okay. It's all right.
meredith No way! There is no way! No way!
michael Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on--
meredith No way! No way! There is no way!
michael Here we go. This is gonna be good.
meredith No! No way! I told you. We talked about this. There is absolutely no way. No! No! There is no way! No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
michael Yes you are.
meredith I am not going in there! NO!!
meredith Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
michael Shhh. just calm down.
meredith Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! No! No!
michael Come on. Shh.
meredith No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
michael Here's the door. Here's the door.
meredith There is no way! There is no way! No! No!
michael Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
meredith This man is crazy! This man is crazy! Rehab
nurse Can I help you?
michael I have a deposit. Alcoholic.
meredith No! No! No! No! No!
michael So do I sign?
meredith NO!!!
phyllis I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
angela It's outside.
phyllis I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be.
angela Shut up.
phyllis Excuse me?
angela I'm not moving the tree. Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell. And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
phyllis Okay. Angela's having s*x with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
dwight Well don't look so surprised.
pam I knew it.
jim You did not know it.
pam I knew some of it.
jim Everyone knew some of it.
pam It's Christmas.
jim You knew it.
pam Thank you. I knew it.
jim She knew it.
michael As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push meredith to the bottom. Um. I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.
andy All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer. Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo.
angela I think I'd like to go home now.
andy Sure. Dooo. Tough room. Come on. I just learned it. Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
