oscar . Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good.
jim Yeah, that's right.
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.
pam Michael, what's wrong?
michael I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!

pam Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!

jim Hey, whoa, Michael.
michael Oh God!
jim It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
michael OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
jim You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?
michael I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.
michael Pam, could you come get me?!
pam Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
michael Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
phyllis Michael, you should stay home and rest.
michael There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan. tell ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?
kevin Can you hop?
michael I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
michael No one wants to pick me up!?
dwight What is going on? What is going on?
pam Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
michael I'm not sick! I'm burned!

michael Hellooo? . Please don't send Dwight!
michael Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.
pam You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
michael Did you explain why?

pam And do my job?
michael No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!
dwight It slipped.
michael What?
dwight Sorry.
pam It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
michael I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.
pam Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
michael No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.

phyllis Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
michael No, never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble.
creed When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
michael Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
stanley I'm not disabled and neither are you.
michael Ok, what does this look like to you Stanley?!
stanley Mailboxes, Etc.
michael Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.

michael Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning? Billy

jim I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill. Billy
merchant So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of.
michael Ok. Billy
merchant First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? Yes. Yeah? yes.

merchant Let me stop you right there.
michael Ok. Billy
merchant And leave.
michael Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy. Billy
merchant What's wrong with that guy?
jim You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot. Billy
merchant No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion.
michael Hey!
ryan I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
michael You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.
ryan You are very welcome.

ryan You sure?
michael Yeh.
ryan Ok.
michael You know what? I feel better. ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
michael Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
ryan I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
michael Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
dwight Uh, ugh, ohhhh.
jim Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.

angela He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him.
michael Why don't you go with him?
angela I, barely know him.
dwight I want michael to take me.
michael I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
meredith You can take my van!
michael Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. jim why don't you drive.

pam Oh my goodness!
dwight 
pam Come here.
dwight Oh, huggy hugs.
michael Shotgun!
jim You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
michael The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "shotgun" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
michael Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?
jim Well, I think she has a kid.
michael Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.

dwight No!
jim Give the bottle to Michael!
dwight I'm thirsty!

jim Come on Dwight.

doctor So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.
dwight What is that?
michael Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
doctor Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot.
michael Ok, what kinda machine is that?

dwight Oh.
michael Fine. Fine.
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
jim Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
pam Oh my God, what is going on, is dwight ok?
jim Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
pam I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
jim michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.
