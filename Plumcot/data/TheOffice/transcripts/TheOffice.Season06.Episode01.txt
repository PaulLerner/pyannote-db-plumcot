michael_scott Parkour!
dwight_schrute & Andy
andy_bernard Parkour!
dwight_schrute Extreme! Parkour!
jim_halpert This... is Parkour. Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
dwight_schrute
dwight_schrute & Andy Parkour! Parkour!

dwight_schrute Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!
michael_scott Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
andy_bernard Here it is, here it is... truck, to refrigerators, to dumpster, 360 onto the pallets, backflip gainer to the trash can.
michael_scott & Dwight Yeah! Gainer! Woohoo!
andy_bernard Hardcore Parkour!

michael_scott & Dwight
andy_bernard Parkour!
dwight_schrute Good. Excellent. Thank you.
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode01 Intern There you go. Is there anything else I can do?
dwight_schrute Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode01 Intern Mm hmm.
dwight_schrute Go put them all in random order.
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode01 intern Mm-kay.
dwight_schrute Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
pam_beesly This is the last day of our summer interns. It's been nice. We haven't had interns for a while, ever since Michael's Monica Lewinsky incident. He didn't do anything sexual. He just made far, far too many Monica Lewinsky jokes. It was just easier for corporate to shut down the program.
meredith_palmer Think she did him?
oscar_martinez I bet there's something there. I was with them in the kitchen yesterday, and they were all too happy to be cleaning the freezer.
kelly_kapoor If they get married before I do, I'm going to kill myself.
michael_scott Who's getting married?
pam_beesly Nobody.
michael_scott If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
kelly_kapoor It's Eric and Megan.
michael_scott Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
phyllis_vance They're not getting married. It's just talk.
michael_scott Did everybody know about this but me?
phyllis_vance There's nothing to know, it's just gossip.
michael_scott Okay... okay.
pam_beesly We haven't told anyone I'm pregnant.
jim_halpert Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
pam_beesly Yeah, we don't want them at the wedding thinking Jim's being marched down the aisle by my dad with a shotgum.
jim_halpert Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
pam_beesly Nope.
jim_halpert No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
pam_beesly Can't back out now, Halpert.
jim_halpert What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
pam_beesly No, keep it up.
michael_scott You'll never guess what I know.
dwight_schrute Okay, let me finish this thought.
michael_scott Eric likes Megan.
dwight_schrute He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
michael_scott How do you know this?
dwight_schrute People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
michael_scott I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?
michael_scott Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said "The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle."
mori What are you talking about?
michael_scott I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
mori At Tink's?
michael_scott Yes
mori How'd you know about that?
michael_scott Well...
mori Did Stanley tell you?
michael_scott Stanley was on your group date?
mori No, Stanley was with his wife. I waved at him, but he didn't wave back.
michael_scott Does anybody else know about this?
mori No.
michael_scott
michael_scott There he goes. There he goes.
michael_scott So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?
dwight_schrute Jim & Pam
michael_scott Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...
pam_beesly Just keep it to yourself then.
michael_scott Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
dwight_schrute Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
michael_scott Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
phyllis_vance Teri's out of town, Michael.
michael_scott Who?
phyllis_vance Teri, Stanley's wife. She's at an interior decorating expo in Philly. Stanley hates crowds, kids, and music. I think you should check your facts.
michael_scott
michael_scott You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.
mori What are you talking about?
michael_scott Stanley's wife is out of town.
mori He was with somebody.
eric He was definitely with somebody.
michael_scott Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
eric
michael_scott I don't get it!
eric If that was his sister, then what they were doing was totally illegal.
michael_scott Drugs?
eric Making out.
michael_scott Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
michael_scott Stanley is having an affir.
kelly_kapoor WHAT??
michael_scott I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.
michael_scott That and that are the same letter.
kevin_malone Q.
michael_scott No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?
kevin_malone T.
michael_scott T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.
michael_scott Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?
stanley_hudson I'm meeting a client. Do you have a problem with that?
michael_scott No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
stanley_hudson Goodbye.
michael_scott Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
jim_halpert You have to stop this.
michael_scott Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
jim_halpert I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
michael_scott Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
jim_halpert Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.
michael_scott
michael_scott Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. Stanley, are you having an affair?
stanley_hudson That is ridiculous. Of course not, why would you think that?
michael_scott So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
stanley_hudson Damn! I told her it was a stupid idea to go up in that club.
michael_scott So stupid!
stanley_hudson It's just that... Teri's been traveling a lot...
michael_scott I know, I know.
stanley_hudson And it's been lonely.
michael_scott Oh, I bet.
stanley_hudson Cynthia's been keeping me company. She was my nurse, when I was in rehabilitation. We used to go on these long walks on the treadmill... I didn't...
michael_scott Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
stanley_hudson Yeah, but Michael, I'm going to go break it off. That's where I'm headed right now. I swear.
michael_scott Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
stanley_hudson I just need you to promise not to say a word about this to anyone. Michael, please.
michael_scott I'm not saying... a damn thing.
stanley_hudson I'm counting on you, Michael.
michael_scott You can count on me.
stanley_hudson
michael_scott Oh, that smells good.
kevin_malone I might have extra, it just depends on how many I eat.
michael_scott Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
kevin_malone Yeah... what do you mean exactly?
michael_scott Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.
kevin_malone Reeeeally.
michael_scott Uh huh. Alright?
michael_scott How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including "Stanley is having an affair." It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.
erin_hannon Kelly has an eating disorder?
michael_scott Yeah.
erin_hannon She always eats my lunch.
michael_scott Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
erin_hannon We should do something.
michael_scott Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
michael_scott I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.
kelly_kapoor Really?
michael_scott Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
kelly_kapoor Andy Bernard??
michael_scott Mm hmm.
michael_scott Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
meredith_palmer Really?
michael_scott Yeah!
meredith_palmer She's gonna hate being a mom.
andy_bernard
kevin_malone
andy_bernard What?
kevin_malone Tea.
andy_bernard So?
kevin_malone You would.
andy_bernard I like tea!
kevin_malone Oh, I bet you like it.
andy_bernard Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!
kevin_malone Do you like it as much as you like mens' butts?
andy_bernard WHAT??
kevin_malone Because you're gay.
andy_bernard Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?
andy_bernard This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. But it makes you wonder.
andy_bernard Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?
oscar_martinez I did. Yes.
andy_bernard And?
oscar_martinez What?
andy_bernard Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?
oscar_martinez Are you attracted to other men?
andy_bernard No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.
oscar_martinez
andy_bernard Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?
oscar_martinez If you resisted Brad Pitt a little bit, he would still... need to get to you?
andy_bernard It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.
oscar_martinez Wow. I wish... I wish I could help you. I don't... you might be gay. You might be gay.
oscar_martinez What exactly is my responsibility here? To comfort insecure heterosexual men? That can't possibly fall to me.
phyllis_vance How far along is Pam?
meredith_palmer A few months, that's why they're rushing the wedding.
michael_scott Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
michael_scott Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
dwight_schrute Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
eric Why would we call you at night?
dwight_schrute Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
jim_halpert You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
dwight_schrute Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
erin_hannon I am so happy you're eating again.
kelly_kapoor Me too!
andy_bernard Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?
jim_halpert Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
andy_bernard Women friends?
jim_halpert Yep.
andy_bernard Not guy friends?
jim_halpert Are you... interested in her guy friends?
andy_bernard No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.
jim_halpert Okay.
andy_bernard But off the record, I'm kinda confused.
jim_halpert Really.
andy_bernard Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...
jim_halpert Well you gotta figure this out.
andy_bernard Yeah, right?
jim_halpert Yeah!
andy_bernard How?
jim_halpert You gotta have s*x with a woman.
andy_bernard Right-o.
jim_halpert And a man.
andy_bernard Ohh...
jim_halpert And then compare.
andy_bernard Alright. Well hey...
jim_halpert Yep.
andy_bernard Congratulations to you.
jim_halpert On what?
andy_bernard Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.
jim_halpert
angela_martin Did you know a baby conceived out of wedlock is still a b*st*rd?
pam_beesly What?
angela_martin Want me to say it again?
pam_beesly Why did that come into your brain?
jim_halpert Can I talk to you for a second?
jim_halpert So, they know.
pam_beesly Who did you tell?
jim_halpert I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
pam_beesly Nobody!
creed_bratton Hey, did one of you tell Stanley I have asthma? Because I don't, and if it gets out, they won't let me scuba.
creed_bratton If I can't scuba, then what's this all been about? What am I working toward?
oscar_martinez What? You think I'm the voice of the Taco Bell dog?
toby_flenderson What are you guys talking about? I have a daughter. How can I be a virgin?
jim_halpert Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
all@ Yes.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
jim_halpert Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
michael_scott That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.
pam_beesly Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.
kevin_malone I need to do mine first. Who's been saying that there's another person inside of me, working me with controls?
creed_bratton I heard that from... Andy.
andy_bernard I heard it from Erin.
erin_hannon I heard it from Michael.
michael_scott
pam_beesly Michael? He's over here!
pam_beesly Where are you going?
michael_scott Nowhere.
dwight_schrute Michael... You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm?
pam_beesly Don't get on it.
jim_halpert Michael, don't.
pam_beesly Don't... get... on. Do not.
jim_halpert Michael...
kevin_malone Stay.
pam_beesly Step away.
creed_bratton Come on, boss.
michael_scott
michael_scott Okay, I made it all up.
all@
andy_bernard Even the fact that I'm gay?
michael_scott Yes.
andy_bernard Yes!
michael_scott But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
angela_martin No. We heard that about Jim.
michael_scott Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
angela_martin How is that a bad rumor?
michael_scott Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
oscar_martinez Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
stanley_hudson You told everyone I was having an affair?
michael_scott Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
kelly_kapoor Well then, what's the one true rumor?
phyllis_vance We have a right to know.
andy_bernard Michael... am I gay?
michael_scott The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...
jim_halpert That Pam's pregnant.
angela_martin I knew it!
kevin_malone I knew it! Her breasts were a tiny bit bigger. At first I thought "Oh, she has a new bra with padding." But then I thought "Pam doesn't need padding." It just didn't add up, Jim.
jim_halpert Okay. Thank you.
phyllis_vance Congratulations!
erin_hannon That's really great, you guys.
ryan_howard Don't vaccinate it.
dwight_schrute Who's the father?
pam_beesly Jim.
creed_bratton How far along?
jim_halpert Four months.
creed_bratton Who's the OB/GYN?
pam_beesly Stop. Don't. Just...
michael_scott Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
jim_halpert Nope.
michael_scott Yes. Jim...
jim_halpert Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.
pam_beesly Yes.
jim_halpert If everyone would like to see proof.
pam_beesly Okay.
kelly_kapoor Are we just gonna wait here?
all@
kelly_kapoor It's true!
michael_scott Look at that! That is the inside of your v*g1n*!
pam_beesly It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now.
michael_scott How long have you known about the pregnancy?
jim_halpert & Pam
michael_scott A week? A month? A year?
jim_halpert Michael, we only told our parents last week.
michael_scott Did you pee on a stick?
jim_halpert I did. It was inconclusive.
michael_scott You should've told me.
pam_beesly You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.
michael_scott
erin_hannon Michael, Teri Hudson returning your call.
michael_scott
pam_beesly You called Stanley's wife?
michael_scott Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
jim_halpert Don't take it.
michael_scott No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.
pam_beesly If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.
michael_scott No, no, I can do this.
jim_halpert You can't do this.
michael_scott Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
jim_halpert That sounds terrible.
pam_beesly Michael, please don't.
michael_scott Hey, what up, Cynthia?
jim_halpert
michael_scott Hold on a second, Cynthia.
jim_halpert
michael_scott Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.
mori I learned that a company can describe their internship as "full of exciting experiences," even if that's a lie. There's no regulation.
megan I learned that half these people's email password is "password."
eric I learned that a ream of paper is 300 sheets.
megan I thought it was 500.
eric Oh... I guess I didn't learn anything.
mori I learned that if you look even the tiniest bit like Jet Li, Michael will call you "Jet Li" all summer.
megan Julia Stiles.
eric Alan Thicke.
