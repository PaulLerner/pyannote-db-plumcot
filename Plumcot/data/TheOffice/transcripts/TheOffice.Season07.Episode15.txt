pam_beesly Hey. How you doing?
darryl_philbin Thinking about my grandmother a lot.
pam_beesly Yeah.
darryl_philbin She was about to turn 97.
pam_beesly At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.
darryl_philbin Thank you. "Congratulations, Darryl. Let's get wasted." "Have fun today, big guy." "Aww, yeah. Party time. Whoo-whoop."
pam_beesly It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.
darryl_philbin "Hooray. Live it up big D. " "Days like this don't come often enough. Time to celebrate. You deserve this"?
andy_bernard Birthday punches! One two three four five sice seven eight!
pam_beesly I'm so sorry.
darryl_philbin
andy_bernard ...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...
andy_bernard ...So I got an early res at Blue Wasabi and I'm taking Rachel. She's picking me up after work.
darryl_philbin Rachel from the party?
andy_bernard Oh, yeah!
darryl_philbin Nice. Do the damn thing. - Pow!
phyllis_vance Blue Wasabi is so good, but get the cheeseburger. They say they won't do it, but they will if you make a scene.
holly_flax Okay, bye. Okay, bye. I'll miss you.
michael_scott Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
holly_flax Bye.
michael_scott Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
holly_flax Okay, one more quick one.
michael_scott Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
michael_scott Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.
gabe_lewis And what do we have here?
erin_hannon From my secret admirer. That's you!
gabe_lewis Come on.
gabe_lewis I dominate Valentine's Day. I practically make romance into a science.
erin_hannon "Roses are red. Violets are blue. Look in the vase to find your first clue." Oh, my gosh. It's a romantic scavenger hunt!
gabe_lewis Oh, close. It's a romantic treasure hunt. A scavenger hunt is where you find items from a master list. This is where you follow clues that lead to a prize. Common misuse. Good luck.
erin_hannon But, there's no clue.
gabe_lewis Well, get to work.
erin_hannon I can't, 'cause there's no clue.
gabe_lewis The puzzle is the clue.
erin_hannon Oh.
oscar_martinez
michael_scott Are these numbers correct?
oscar_martinez The numbers are correct, Michael.
michael_scott Okay.
oscar_martinez
michael_scott Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.
oscar_martinez I jus... I just need a signature.
jim_halpert There you go. Thanks.
pam_beesly How much did you give him?
jim_halpert Big tip.
pam_beesly Wait. I don't have my scarf.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly I'm missing my scarf. Oh.
jim_halpert We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
pam_beesly Yeah, lunch was wonderful!
jim_halpert Shh.
pam_beesly Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?
jim_halpert Um, bottomless champagne.
pam_beesly Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?
jim_halpert No.
erin_hannon Psst! Psst!
andy_bernard What's up?
erin_hannon Are you good at jigsaw puzzles?
andy_bernard Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
erin_hannon Okay.
andy_bernard But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
erin_hannon Oh! No, no, no, no. It's not weird at all. You have your new girlfriend. I have Gabe. This is just as friends.
andy_bernard Well, okay then.
erin_hannon Yes!
andy_bernard At least until Stanley calms down.
erin_hannon Oh, is he...
andy_bernard D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku.
erin_hannon Andy.
jim_halpert All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really.
jim_halpert Wait.
dwight_schrute You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
jim_halpert Aww, nuts.
angela_martin I don't know if anyone else feels this way and don't get me wrong, I love Michael and Holly, and maybe I'm being overly sensitive, but... the PDA.
oscar_martinez Yes! The freaking PDA!
angela_martin Uh-huh.
oscar_martinez Thank you! I mean, I'm thrilled for them.
angela_martin No one is more thrilled for them than I am...
oscar_martinez Yes, yes, absolutely.
angela_martin ...but it's totally inappropriate.
darryl_philbin Yeah, it's a little much.
phyllis_vance Mm-hmm.
darryl_philbin Obviously, so happy for them both.
oscar_martinez So happy. Yeah.
kevin_malone I don't know, guys. I, for one, enjoy watching them, because...
angela_martin No, stop! Just don't.
oscar_martinez Kevin!
kevin_malone Can I finish? Can I finish? Is that okay? I was saying...I enjoy watching them because it makes me horny.
all@
angela_martin God! Kevin!
erin_hannon So tell me about your new girlfriend.
andy_bernard She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.
erin_hannon Aww, cute.
andy_bernard Hey, look at that. Done.
erin_hannon That's Gabe's boom box. Come on. We have to go find it.
andy_bernard I wish you well on your quest.
erin_hannon No, come on.
andy_bernard Aww, I mean...
erin_hannon Come on!
andy_bernard Okay.
erin_hannon Ha!
gabe_lewis I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just... like it's coming from my own head.
michael_scott Sit. Okay, just close your eyes.
holly_flax Ohh. Can you get lower?
michael_scott Oh, yeah.
holly_flax A little lower.
holly_flax I cannot keep myself from Michael. Everything he does is sexy. He has this undeniable animal magnetism. He's a jungle cat. The man exudes s*x. He can put both his legs behind his head.
gabe_lewis Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice.
michael_scott
gabe_lewis Yes?
michael_scott Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
gabe_lewis Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
michael_scott Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
gabe_lewis First things first. An office romance is permissible. Not something you'd expect to hear from corporate. Well, guess what. Sabre is 100% tolerant of office romances.
ryan_howard Speaking of, Gabe, I don't see Erin at this meeting.
meredith_palmer Uh, I also don't see Andy.
kevin_malone Oooh.
jim_halpert OOH! Boom! Face!
gabe_lewis I get it. Andy's slamming my girlfriend. Very funny. What I do not approve of, however, is public displays of affection, or PDAs. PDAs are totally superfluous to a happy, healthy office romance. Perfect example. Look at Jim and Pam.
pam_beesly Yeah. What? Us?
gabe_lewis They don't touch. They don't kiss. You would hardly even know that they were husband and wife.
jim_halpert Did it!
pam_beesly Yeah!
jim_halpert Love it. Keep it goin.
gabe_lewis Okay. So, PDAs. That's gonna include behaviors such as hugging, kissing, uh...
kevin_malone Booby honking.
gabe_lewis Yeah, booby honking. Sure.
kevin_malone Butt honking.
gabe_lewis Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking.
creed_bratton The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap...
gabe_lewis Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem.
oscar_martinez Are you guys listening to this?
michael_scott What, are you talking about me and Holly?
pam_beesly Yeah!
gabe_lewis Maybe you find your own chair.
holly_flax So we kiss occasionally.
oscar_martinez Not occasionally. All the time.
phyllis_vance Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering.
stanley_hudson The flirtatious tickling.
michael_scott Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
darryl_philbin That thing were you softly exhale on her neck.
michael_scott I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
dwight_schrute Michael. Confession I have done PDA in the office.
michael_scott Thank you.
dwight_schrute I've had intercourse in the office.
michael_scott All right.
dwight_schrute As has Angela!
angela_martin Dwight!
dwight_schrute As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. As has Michael and as has Holly.
kevin_malone As has Kevin!
angela_martin With who?
kevin_malone She goes to another school.
michael_scott Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
oscar_martinez Good.
michael_scott You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
angela_martin No.
michael_scott Anything goes.
oscar_martinez Just leave it how you said...
dwight_schrute Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
michael_scott Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
dwight_schrute And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
michael_scott Pro.
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott What? Problem solved.
michael_scott No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.
pam_beesly That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have s*x in the office. That's where you work, right?
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
pam_beesly You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had s*x there, except for you and him.
jim_halpert Ew.
erin_hannon Don't mind us. You keep working.
darryl_philbin Okay. I'll keep working.
erin_hannon Oh, my God. It's a song.
andy_bernard Whoa.
erin_hannon What do you think is on it?
andy_bernard We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.
erin_hannon Not if we're talking like this. I think it's okay. He doesn't seem to hear us.
andy_bernard I think he can hear us.
andy_bernard That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.
erin_hannon Darryl.
andy_bernard Darryl is a jerk.
erin_hannon No, he's not.
andy_bernard No, I'm just testing if he can hear.
darryl_philbin I can hear you.
andy_bernard Oh. Okay.
erin_hannon Okay. Then no more talking. Let's just play the song.
Boom#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode15 Box The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night. The temp at night.
andy_bernard The temp at night?
erin_hannon What do you...
darryl_philbin You got it. Pick it up. Take it out.
andy_bernard Pi...
darryl_philbin Pick it up.
andy_bernard Okay.
darryl_philbin Take it out. Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up. Take it out.
andy_bernard Right. Okay.
holly_flax Sorry to interrupt. Forgot to collect my things.
michael_scott Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.
holly_flax Oh, no. Michael, I don't want to make people uncomfortable.
michael_scott Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
holly_flax Yeah, but if they're uncomfortable, it makes me uncomfortable.
michael_scott Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.
holly_flax Okay.
michael_scott Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.
michael_scott Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.
holly_flax Two people in love?
michael_scott I love you.
holly_flax Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, "oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl." Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?
michael_scott I love you-love you.
holly_flax Wow, you love me-love me. I love you-love you.
michael_scott I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you.
holly_flax I love you.
michael_scott Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.
andy_bernard Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?
erin_hannon I guess we just have to wait until night and see.
andy_bernard Oh, or maybe not.
erin_hannon Oh. Cool.
andy_bernard How romantic is this?
erin_hannon Super romantic.
andy_bernard Right. Do you see a clue or...
erin_hannon Yeah. Did you not see it?
andy_bernard Oh, my gosh.
erin_hannon Hanks.
jim_halpert and Pam Hey!
andy_bernard and Erin Hey.
andy_bernard No time to chat.
erin_hannon Sorry.
jim_halpert Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.
ryan_howard Hey. You're looking for me?
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.
ryan_howard No you weren't.
pam_beesly No, we weren't.
ryan_howard You wanted to have s*x in my office.
pam_beesly No.
jim_halpert Definitely not. That's disgusting.
ryan_howard No. It's... it's cool. Just try to put everything back were you found it. Text me when you're finished. I'll be out here.
jim_halpert Hey, you don't have to...
pam_beesly That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.
jim_halpert That was really rough.
pam_beesly Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have s*x in the office.
jim_halpert No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.
pam_beesly Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.
jim_halpert And a shower.
michael_scott Hello, Holly.
holly_flax Hello.
michael_scott Here, shake. No!
holly_flax No, don't touch.
michael_scott No, we can't.
holly_flax No touching.
michael_scott No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
holly_flax Oh.
michael_scott Oh.
holly_flax Almost got you.
michael_scott Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
holly_flax You're not touching me.
michael_scott I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
oscar_martinez Okay, this is much worse than before.
kevin_malone Yeah, I agree. This is nasty.
michael_scott Grab you here.
holly_flax And here.
michael_scott I will grab you here anyway.
gabe_lewis You have to cut it out.
holly_flax Okay.
michael_scott Never.
holly_flax You said you would.
michael_scott I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
gabe_lewis No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling.
holly_flax No, I don't think so.
gabe_lewis Number two You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
michael_scott Yes, it was that. It's that one.
holly_flax Yes. Number three.
holly_flax Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
michael_scott We're not supposed to PDA.
holly_flax Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
michael_scott I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
holly_flax Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
michael_scott That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?
holly_flax We weren't in love last time.
michael_scott I was in love with you.
holly_flax I'm not saying it won't be hard. But we can make it work. That's what she said.
michael_scott
erin_hannon Oh. One Erin Special, please.
hank Here's your bottle of sparkling cider.
andy_bernard Hey.
erin_hannon That's my favorite.
hank I'm now supposed to tell you to enjoy a mind-hunt break and look for a heart or some in the break room when you're through.
kevin_malone Hey, buck up, buddy!
darryl_philbin Make that face he likes.
dwight_schrute Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
michael_scott It's like a time bomb...
dwight_schrute Shh.
michael_scott ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
dwight_schrute Just hush.
michael_scott Sexual time bomb.
dwight_schrute Just rock. Shh.
michael_scott Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
dwight_schrute Movie idea?
michael_scott No. Saving the world has never been this hard.
dwight_schrute Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
michael_scott No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.
dwight_schrute Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
kevin_malone Which one? I have a lot of stupid faces.
dwight_schrute I don't know.
michael_scott Do the monkey face.
dwight_schrute Do the monkey face!
michael_scott I love that. I love that face.
dwight_schrute Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
michael_scott No. The monkey!
dwight_schrute Go back to the monkey!
michael_scott Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
dwight_schrute Hurl your feces.
michael_scott That's good.
dwight_schrute Good.
michael_scott That's good. He's throwing it.
dwight_schrute They really do that.
michael_scott I know.
erin_hannon B-9.
andy_bernard B-9.
erin_hannon Like a benign tumor.
andy_bernard Maybe it's just more like, "be mine."
erin_hannon Oh, yes. There's a note. "A little cookie for you, my miss. But the real treasure is your Valentine's kiss."
andy_bernard Mm.
erin_hannon Mm. Oh. We're suppose to...mmm
andy_bernard Hmm.
michael_scott Holly. Hey.
holly_flax Hi.
michael_scott Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
holly_flax What? What are you talking about?
michael_scott Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
holly_flax No, we're gonna talk now. You're not breaking up with me.
michael_scott You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...
holly_flax What if I said it wasn't up to them?
michael_scott Who?
holly_flax The company. Nobody knows our future, but it's not gonna be decided by the company. It's not gonna be decided by anybody but us. What we are is up to you and me.
michael_scott Okay. Okay.
michael_scott Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!
oscar_martinez Are you kidding? I wasn't trying to break you guys up.
kevin_malone Better luck next time, pal.
michael_scott Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.
holly_flax You do?
michael_scott I do.
oscar_martinez Go on. Kiss each other already.
kevin_malone Suck it, Oscar. This must kill you.
oscar_martinez I just told them to do it!
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly No.
jim_halpert No. We took a walk.
pam_beesly We took a walk.
dwight_schrute My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
ryan_howard Anybody can be Prince Charming one day a year with the dinner and the flowers and all that. But you know what impresses me? When a guy can do that no days a year.
kelly_kapoor Flowers, diamonds, three-course meal, violinist comes to my table to serenade me...
kevin_malone Pizza, soda, the moon, someone to share it with.
michael_scott What are our plans for tonight? Umm...
holly_flax
