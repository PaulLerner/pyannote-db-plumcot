michael Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.
jim Why are you telling us this?
michael I am jetting off on an international business trip.
jim Where are you going?
michael To Can-A-da.
jim Where is it?
michael Canada.
jim Okay.
michael My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery.
michael Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
meredith Hello.
michael I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. You are now sexy in your culture.
kevin T minus.
jim Six point five days.
creed One more week.
jim pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
phyllis On more week.
stanley Heh heh. David
wallace Do you have your passport?
michael I have my passport. David
wallace Got your per diem?
michael I have my per diem. I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater. David
wallace Michael, the. that's for your food.
michael Well I'll just. I'll use different money for that. David
wallace I was happy to send michael on this trip. He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire. But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
michael And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce. David
wallace Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
michael Well that is all in the past. David
wallace And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
michael They have one of those?
michael Lets do this!
dwight Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
michael Two are for souvenirs.
dwight Do you have your money belt?
michael I do. It's right here.
dwight No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.
michael No, I don't want to wear a bra.
dwight Here, let me help you.
michael Stop it! Stop it!
dwight Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
michael Okay. Where is my translator?

beth What would you like to drink?
ryan Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon. When pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension.
kelly For you. I'm with Darryl.
ryan This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day.
kelly Is that supposed to impress me?
kelly No. Not going to happen. He has hurt me too much and too often. And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.

 00. Other than that you can take the taxi and the number is right there.

andy One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
concierge Oh, the Huntsman is good.
andy The Huntsman.
concierge Down here. the financial district.
michael A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.
pam Can't believe this.
jim Are you sure?
pam I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
jim Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
pam I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers.

pam I have to stay and retake it.
jim W---Wow. Um. Well. okay.
pam That means another twelve weeks. Can you do this for another three months?
jim It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream.

michael That was a really sucky thing to do. David
wallace Sometimes, we--
michael Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off. right to his face. over the hone. That's respect.
kevin You did it, man. Day one. Congrats.
jim Thanks man.
pam I'm coming back the wrong way. It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff. . and I miss Scranton.
