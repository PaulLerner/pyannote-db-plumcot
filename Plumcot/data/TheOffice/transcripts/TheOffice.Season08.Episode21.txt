phyllis_vance Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
jim_halpert Phyllis says the same twelve clich√©s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
darryl_philbin So how was the drive in?
phyllis_vance Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
darryl_philbin You don't say?
phyllis_vance Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
phyllis_vance Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
oscar_martinez Yeah.
phyllis_vance I actually sleep better when it's raining.
meredith_palmer Tell me about it.
oscar_martinez Time's almost up. How many are left?
pam_beesly Just one. "This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book."
darryl_philbin Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
phyllis_vance What do you mean?
pam_beesly You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
jim_halpert Hey, come on.
phyllis_vance Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
jim_halpert And that's noon. Exactly.
phyllis_vance I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today. I'm really happy being here.
andy_bernard My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
andy_bernard & Erin Hey la, hey la...
andy_bernard ...my girlfriend's back!
erin_hannon ...his girlfriend's back!
andy_bernard Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
kevin_malone Welcome home.
erin_hannon Thank you.
andy_bernard Hey, Kev.
kevin_malone Yeah.
andy_bernard Nice sweater.
kevin_malone Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
andy_bernard What happened to old salty?
dwight_schrute Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
dwight_schrute I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
andy_bernard Okey dokey.
nellie_bertram Yes?
andy_bernard Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
nellie_bertram Oh yes.
andy_bernard I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
nellie_bertram You are most welcome.
andy_bernard Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
nellie_bertram No.
andy_bernard Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
nellie_bertram Mm-hmm.
andy_bernard Get back to normalcy.
nellie_bertram Hmm, no.
ravi ...and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call.
pam_beesly Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
jim_halpert That's it.
kelly_kapoor It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
pam_beesly Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
jim_halpert Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
pam_beesly Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
pam_beesly Kelly has been a handful in the past.
kelly_kapoor Why?
pam_beesly But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. And I just had to get her clean.
kevin_malone Get lower.
ryan_howard Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
jim_halpert Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
ryan_howard Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
pam_beesly Don't shake our baby?
ryan_howard Yeah.
pam_beesly Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
ryan_howard Oh, my God.
pam_beesly Yeah, I'm glad you said something.
ryan_howard Me too.
ryan_howard Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
ryan_howard Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
pam_beesly Yeah, they're really great together.
ryan_howard Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
jim_halpert That's about it, yeah.
robert_california Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
nellie_bertram No.
robert_california I'm sorry?
andy_bernard This is what I was trying to tell you.
robert_california I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me.
nellie_bertram Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
robert_california You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
robert_california I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
nellie_bertram I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
andy_bernard Okay.
nellie_bertram Five... four...
andy_bernard You can't dock my pay-
nellie_bertram Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.
angela_martin On it!
andy_bernard Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
nellie_bertram Do you want to go again?
andy_bernard Angela?
nellie_bertram Let's go again. Five... four...
andy_bernard Ooh, she's counting again.
nellie_bertram Three... two... one...
andy_bernard Oh, oh!
nellie_bertram Angela, two hundred dollars!
angela_martin You got it.
andy_bernard Seriously, Angela?
andy_bernard I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
erin_hannon When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
nellie_bertram I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! Five... four...
andy_bernard You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
nellie_bertram Three...
andy_bernard It's literally like-
nellie_bertram Two... one.
erin_hannon There you go. Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
erin_hannon Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
andy_bernard Oh, yeah, I was just tired.
erin_hannon We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
andy_bernard Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
erin_hannon Really. It's not a big deal.
andy_bernard Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
ryan_howard I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
kelly_kapoor Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
ryan_howard Yeah, the fractional ownership property. Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
kelly_kapoor God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
ryan_howard You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
ryan_howard I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
erin_hannon When you lost the manager job-
dwight_schrute Yes?
erin_hannon Did it affect you outside of the office?
dwight_schrute How?
erin_hannon I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
dwight_schrute Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
erin_hannon Oh, okay.
dwight_schrute Okay?
erin_hannon Okay.
dwight_schrute Washington Monument.
erin_hannon Oh.
dwight_schrute Eiffel Tower.
erin_hannon Okay, okay.
pam_beesly I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
kelly_kapoor He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, "Kelly, that will be the color of our children."
pam_beesly Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
kelly_kapoor Which time?
pam_beesly I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
dwight_schrute One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
dwight_schrute Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
dwight_schrute Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
nellie_bertram What do you mean?
dwight_schrute Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
nellie_bertram I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
nellie_bertram Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
andy_bernard You can't call a meeting. But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
nellie_bertram Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
andy_bernard Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
nellie_bertram No.
andy_bernard Wanted to talk to all of you guys about importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
robert_california Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is "impotence."
nellie_bertram Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
nellie_bertram "Take a man's job, but leave him his balls." Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
nellie_bertram This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
dwight_schrute It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
oscar_martinez Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
nellie_bertram Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
robert_california & Creed How old?
creed_bratton Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
nellie_bertram Dwight told me about it earlier.
erin_hannon Dwight!
all@ What?
erin_hannon You promised!
kevin_malone Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now.
angela_martin What are you doing?
oscar_martinez What is this?
angela_martin Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
andy_bernard Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
andy_bernard I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
andy_bernard Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
jim_halpert Um...
darryl_philbin Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
robert_california It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.
andy_bernard Fascinating.
gabe_lewis I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like s*x, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
nellie_bertram Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
kevin_malone Tip-top shape.
nellie_bertram Oh... Stanley?
stanley_hudson No. Um-um.
nellie_bertram Creed, you are a thousand years old.
creed_bratton Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
andy_bernard Okay, so I-
pam_beesly Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
jim_halpert What happened?
pam_beesly That a couple of times-
jim_halpert Couple of times.
robert_california Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
dwight_schrute Yeah Jim.
andy_bernard Yeah Jim, get it out there.
jim_halpert Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had s*x so many times already, I was exhausted...
pam_beesly Okay, stop.
jim_halpert I was very drunk.
phyllis_vance If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
phyllis_vance Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done.
gabe_lewis I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
angela_martin Ugh.
gabe_lewis This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
robert_california No, that's absolutely the case.
gabe_lewis I know, right?
dwight_schrute You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
robert_california Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share?
kevin_malone Ooh, ooh!
jim_halpert Wow, what are we talking about?
erin_hannon Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
toby_flenderson Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
nellie_bertram The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
robert_california I almost didn't come in today.
andy_bernard Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
nellie_bertram Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
erin_hannon Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! Take 'em yourself!
andy_bernard Oh, and another thing! Our s*x life is none of your businesses!
erin_hannon And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
andy_bernard Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
nellie_bertram Okay, just calm down.
andy_bernard You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
robert_california Andy, why don't you just take a seat?
andy_bernard Why don't you take a seat, you idiot?
erin_hannon And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
andy_bernard And your stupid face! And your stupid office! Ah!
darryl_philbin He does not like that wall.
erin_hannon Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
andy_bernard That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
robert_california Andy, Erin, you can join us now.
ryan_howard Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
pam_beesly All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
ryan_howard Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
pam_beesly Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before I don't like you very much.
ryan_howard Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
oscar_martinez Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
ryan_howard For Kelly?
kevin_malone Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
nate I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
ryan_howard Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
pam_beesly Oh, no, no, no.
oscar_martinez Oh, come on.
pam_beesly Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
ryan_howard No. It would cause me too much pain.
pam_beesly Read through the pain. Be strong.
ryan_howard This poem would crush you!
oscar_martinez Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
kevin_malone Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
ryan_howard You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
kelly_kapoor Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
robert_california Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny.
andy_bernard No.
robert_california Excuse me?
andy_bernard I'm saying no.
robert_california Well you can't say no.
andy_bernard No.
pam_beesly Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
ryan_howard You are toxic! You are toxic!
pam_beesly Boo!
jim_halpert Hey, hey. Okay.
ryan_howard Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
kelly_kapoor I wasn't going to interrupt.
ryan_howard Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
pam_beesly Barf! Ugh, you suck!
ryan_howard What is your problem? Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Wrangler#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode21 Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!
ryan_howard Can we turn this -ing thing around? Thank you.
Wrangler#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode21 She don't wanna turn around.
ryan_howard Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor Ryan.
ryan_howard Will you roll those dice with me?
kelly_kapoor You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
ryan_howard No you don't.
kelly_kapoor I do.
ryan_howard No you don't.
kelly_kapoor I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
ryan_howard What?
kelly_kapoor That was really cool.
angela_martin Ugh. Eww!
jim_halpert Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
angela_martin Oh God!
robert_california Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.
andy_bernard No.
nellie_bertram It's the apology. I really have to insist.
andy_bernard No.
nellie_bertram Stop saying no.
andy_bernard No.
robert_california Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
andy_bernard No.
andy_bernard I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
erin_hannon Here-
andy_bernard Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
erin_hannon But you hurt your hand.
andy_bernard I... Got... It.
erin_hannon Right now?
andy_bernard Yes.
pam_beesly You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
jim_halpert Not at all, can we go?
pam_beesly "Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches."
jim_halpert Second line.
pam_beesly "He is a drifter out to sea."
jim_halpert "And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green."
pam_beesly It's just so dumb. But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
jim_halpert Uh, Ryan can never know.
