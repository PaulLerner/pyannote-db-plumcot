deangelo_vickers So, coasting time is officially over. Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast. If you don't like 'em, this is called a door. You can walk right through it. Alright. I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5. Change number one Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride. Deal with it.
darryl_philbin Seriously?
deangelo_vickers Stone cold seriously.
deangelo_vickers They are trying to figure me out. And I don't like it. Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care.
deangelo_vickers Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair.
toby_flenderson Thanks.
deangelo_vickers Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it.
oscar_martinez These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
deangelo_vickers I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream. You either like it or you don't. That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays. Alright? Clear? Any questions?
kevin_malone This all sounds great to me. But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.
deangelo_vickers That is a s-- astute observation, Kevin.
deangelo_vickers Kev's got me pegged.
deangelo_vickers It blows away Vermont in the fall.
darryl_philbin Snap, for real?
pam_beesly Good morning, Deangelo.
deangelo_vickers Hold on.
pam_beesly Okay.
deangelo_vickers And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring.
pam_beesly Because of the flowers.
deangelo_vickers No. Because the entire state smells like Earth.
pam_beesly Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
deangelo_vickers Yes, Pam.
pam_beesly Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
deangelo_vickers Put it with the rest.
pam_beesly Okay.
deangelo_vickers Hey dudes!
jim_halpert Hey!
andy_bernard Hey!
pam_beesly Oh my God, he hates me!
jim_halpert No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
pam_beesly I know.
jim_halpert Every time there's a silence, your brain's like "Heh-heh-huh-huh" .
pam_beesly Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
jim_halpert Careful. There is no inner circle.
andy_bernard Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah.
jim_halpert There is no inner circle. Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
kevin_malone Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle! Which doesn't exist.
deangelo_vickers There he is! Got ya coffee.
dwight_schrute Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you.
deangelo_vickers Not a coffee guy, I take it.
dwight_schrute It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
deangelo_vickers Listen. I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want.
dwight_schrute I think you'll find what you're looking for over there.
deangelo_vickers No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight.
deangelo_vickers Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh? What do you guys say?
kevin_malone Yes!
deangelo_vickers Right! Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients.
kevin_malone Yeah, I say we just go for it!
deangelo_vickers Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff?
jim_halpert That's Toys R Us, I think.
deangelo_vickers No, that's definitely a knockoff. You can feel the center of gravity's off. Feel that. What do you think?
gabe_lewis Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time.
deangelo_vickers Deangelo! See what I did there? That's what you need to do. It's that little English. The British are coming.
kevin_malone Yes.
deangelo_vickers Deangelo's open!
deangelo_vickers Hey Ry. Your department's killing it, baby.
ryan_howard Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
deangelo_vickers Keep it up.
ryan_howard The problem with having "It" or "the X-factor" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say.
kelly_kapoor What?
ryan_howard I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
kelly_kapoor Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
ryan_howard Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie.
ryan_howard I'd die for you too.
kelly_kapoor You really would?
ryan_howard Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
kelly_kapoor Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
deangelo_vickers Woo. Glad he's not my boss.
ryan_howard You're the best. Thank you.
deangelo_vickers You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's.
dwight_schrute Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.
deangelo_vickers You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?
dwight_schrute I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?
deangelo_vickers Ohhhh no.
dwight_schrute What?
deangelo_vickers Okay? I'm gonna win you over.
dwight_schrute No you're not.
deangelo_vickers Yes I am.
dwight_schrute No.
deangelo_vickers Oh yes.
dwight_schrute No.
deangelo_vickers Yes.
dwight_schrute No.
deangelo_vickers Yes.
dwight_schrute No.
deangelo_vickers Yes.
dwight_schrute No.
deangelo_vickers Yes.
dwight_schrute No.
deangelo_vickers Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
jim_halpert Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative" and "assistant."
darryl_philbin The winner under "Special Skills," Mr. Don Feiner put "Juggling."
deangelo_vickers What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.
jim_halpert Seriously?
deangelo_vickers Oh yeah. I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet? 320?
gabe_lewis 320. Just freeballin' it.
deangelo_vickers It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo?
kevin_malone Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
gabe_lewis Give or take.
deangelo_vickers Sorry gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car. It's not.
pam_beesly Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
andy_bernard I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. Got some extra balls! Hey-hey-hey-ho!
deangelo_vickers Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? Prepare... to go into the danger zone.
pam_beesly Oh wow, you weren't kidding.
deangelo_vickers No. Never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare! Incoming! And we're on! Remember, nothing's impossible! Phyllis, where's Phyllis?
phyllis_vance Here.
deangelo_vickers Do you believe in me, Phyllis?
phyllis_vance Yeah.
deangelo_vickers Because I believe in you.
phyllis_vance Okay.
deangelo_vickers Feel that connection? Don't move your head. Please. Thank you. Oh! Big hand for Phyllis! That took a lot of guts! Ho! I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.
kevin_malone Didn't drop a single ball!
pam_beesly Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.
jim_halpert What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
pam_beesly What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?
jim_halpert He's good at his job. And I like working for him.
angela_martin Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. Deangelo is a huge sexist.
andy_bernard Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the "v*g1n* Monologues" called the "pen1s Apologies." So I know a thing or two.
angela_martin Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin? What about Pam and Kelly? Also department heads. But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
andy_bernard How could I not see it? You're so right.
pam_beesly Why don't you talk to him about it?
jim_halpert And say what? "Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"
pam_beesly Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
jim_halpert Mmm-hmm.
andy_bernard And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his pen1s goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls?
jim_halpert Hey, you got a second?
deangelo_vickers Yeah, I got tons of time. This job's a joke.
deangelo_vickers So what's up?
jim_halpert Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
darryl_philbin Hey, saw Jim come in. We meeting?
deangelo_vickers Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting.
jim_halpert If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
deangelo_vickers What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys!
jim_halpert I know. Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads.
deangelo_vickers Uh-oh. Right?
kevin_malone Hot!
jim_halpert Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
darryl_philbin Damn!
jim_halpert Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
deangelo_vickers Are you serious? Who feels this way?
jim_halpert Oh. Like nobody.
gabe_lewis Umm, Pam?
jim_halpert It was --
gabe_lewis Was it Pam?
kevin_malone That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. Kevin...
deangelo_vickers Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea.
jim_halpert That's awesome.
deangelo_vickers Thank you.
kelly_kapoor Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again.
ryan_howard So I am the new customer service supervisor.
kelly_kapoor When Deangelo's around.
ryan_howard And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
kelly_kapoor All the time.
ryan_howard All the time.
deangelo_vickers Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?
erin_hannon Absolutely.
jim_halpert Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
deangelo_vickers Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not. I am not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a v*g1n*. Raise your hand if someone you love has a v*g1n*. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Just about everyone. What about Deangelo's hand? Oh wow. He's got 'em both up. Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.
phyllis_vance I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
deangelo_vickers Dwight, what's your take?
dwight_schrute What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all.
deangelo_vickers Man, you're smart. Oh, hey! Hi! Hello. Welcome. Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield. This is everyone.
jordan_garfield Hello.
pam_beesly So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office?
jordan_garfield No, Anthropology. We don't have this in that size, pretty lame.
kelly_kapoor Lame? You worked at Anthropology?
jordan_garfield Yeah.
kelly_kapoor That's like my dream job. How did you even get that job?
jordan_garfield Well, I umm -
kelly_kapoor You chose this job over that job?
ryan_howard Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
pam_beesly So, umm, is this your first office job then?
jordan_garfield Yeah.
deangelo_vickers Yup.
pam_beesly Wow.
deangelo_vickers No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits.
kevin_malone Jim, you coming?
jim_halpert Oh yeah, did he text us?
kevin_malone Yeah.
dwight_schrute No!
pam_beesly Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us.
jim_halpert He didn't text me.
andy_bernard Yes! I'm in.
angela_martin Andy, what are you doing?
andy_bernard I'm going in, into the belly of the beast. Gonna infiltrate and change from within. What's up, mancave!
pam_beesly Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
deangelo_vickers Internally, for office use where do we get our paper from? Do we go -
jim_halpert Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
deangelo_vickers Hey Jim.
jim_halpert Yeah.
deangelo_vickers Can I help you?
jim_halpert Nope. Just... Okay.
dwight_schrute So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
jim_halpert Well, there is no inner...circle.
jordan_garfield Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
dwight_schrute Really? Anything.
jordan_garfield Do you need anything?
dwight_schrute Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
andy_bernard Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
jim_halpert So this is my life. Until I win the lottery . Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
pam_beesly So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
ryan_howard Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
deangelo_vickers No one likes a money grubber.
kelly_kapoor I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss. Okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
deangelo_vickers Ohh.
ryan_howard Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically. Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding.
deangelo_vickers Is this true, Ryan?
ryan_howard I did not see Rango.
deangelo_vickers Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said.
kelly_kapoor He's not saying anything!
deangelo_vickers It's too murky. I like Ryan. You seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way.
kelly_kapoor That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti--
ryan_howard Oh, close call! Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
pam_beesly Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
gabe_lewis Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
deangelo_vickers Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?
gabe_lewis Total brain burp.
deangelo_vickers I'm no MJ. I can do his dunk. From the free throw line.
kevin_malone Whoa.
darryl_philbin Daaamn! Mad respect for my brotha!
darryl_philbin The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
pam_beesly Okay, well it's just really loud.
deangelo_vickers Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, ladies, back to the game.
darryl_philbin Do it!
deangelo_vickers Jim! Come on in.
pam_beesly You're back in.
jim_halpert You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
deangelo_vickers Yeah, we'll set that up one day.
jim_halpert Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
deangelo_vickers Yeah, I don't know.
jim_halpert Why not?
deangelo_vickers Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it.
dwight_schrute Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
deangelo_vickers Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper!
dwight_schrute Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership.
jim_halpert Alright, there you go.
deangelo_vickers Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?
jim_halpert 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
deangelo_vickers Nah, that's 15. Yeah.
jim_halpert Okay.
deangelo_vickers And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?
jordan_garfield Seriously?
deangelo_vickers Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you. Best seat in the house.
jordan_garfield I don't, I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry.
deangelo_vickers Right. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it.
kevin_malone Yes! Okay.
deangelo_vickers Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela?
angela_martin No.
deangelo_vickers Oscar?
oscar_martinez No thank you.
deangelo_vickers Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible.
jim_halpert Fantastic.
deangelo_vickers Alright?
jim_halpert Yup.
deangelo_vickers This is also for the troops. Doctor is in! Ahhhh!
jim_halpert Now what?
erin_hannon Deangelo?
deangelo_vickers Tablab.
jim_halpert Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?
erin_hannon Who should I say is calling?
jim_halpert Erin.
deangelo_vickers says to bartender Droswip. Droswip.
gabe_lewis Droswip, yeah. I get it. Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
