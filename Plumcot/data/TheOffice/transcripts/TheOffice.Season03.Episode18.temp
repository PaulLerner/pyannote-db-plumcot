michael Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
dwight Yes. But this seems to be.
michael And now, the chains.
michael A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
michael MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic. And now, michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
dwight I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
michael No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
jim Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
michael I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
pam So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
michael No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.
michael AHHHH!
kevin Is everything ok, Michael?
michael Yes.
michael I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key.
michael Alright.
dwight 
michael Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
jim Another worm? Like, are they friends?
dwight It's early bird gets the worm.
michael Pam, would you smell my breath?
pam No, no.
dwight Let me smell. Good, not great.
michael "Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?" Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
michael Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
jim Oh no thanks, I think karen and I will take my car.
michael Sure? Might be a good idea.
jim Yeah.
michael Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
jim Thanks.
michael Play some games?
jim Oh. Um. I think we're good.
michael I spy?
jim Yeah.
jim Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
dwight Thanks for inviting me along.
michael Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? Heh-woh you.
jan Michael?
michael Hey, Buttercup.
jan Hi.
michael I am on my way. I should be there in about 15.
jan Let's just blow this party off.
michael That's what she said.
jan Am I on speaker phone?
michael Uh, yes you are.
jan Is anybody else in the.
dwight Hello, Jan.
jan Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
michael No problem.
jan Ok. Let's just go to a motel.
michael Ok.
jan . and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
michael Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I.
jan Still on speaker?
michael Ummm. I don't know.
jan Are camera's there?
michael Maybe.
jan See you soon.
michael Ok.
dwight Talk to you later, Jan.
michael Alright. Bye.
pam Hey, michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
roy I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so. we're going to go get hammered.
pam Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
roy Ok.
pam I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
michael Beauty. Thank you sir!
dwight Salad.
michael Thank you.
dwight You dressed exactly like the servants.
michael Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
dwight Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
michael I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
dwight That would have been really embarrassing.
michael Yes.
dwight Crisis averted.
michael Ok.
pam Oh, that duck is so cute.
kevin Hey Pam.
pam Hey guys.
kevin Oscar. Angela.
michael Hi.
michael Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
michael Oh, um, potato salad.
dwight It's from both of us.
michael No, it's not.
rachel Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.
michael Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
michael It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
pam Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
kevin Yeah.
kelly Oh my God, when is it?
kevin It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
roy Hey.
pam Hey. You made it.
roy You said it was important, so. How's it going?
kenny What's up, Pam.
pam Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
roy You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
everyone Yeah.
roy Yeah? Get you a drink.
kenny Thanks man.
angela No thank you, Roy.
dwight Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
michael What are you looking for? You bring dip?
jan I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
michael Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
jan You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
michael Over our love.
jan I've never told you that I love you.
michael You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
jan I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
jan What's this over the "i"?
michael It's a heart.
jan Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
michael I love this woman!
jan Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
dwight Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica? Dan
gore No.
dwight No? Then you are an idiot.
rachel Hello Michael.
michael Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So.
david Jan, glad you could make it.
jan Of course, of course, David. Do you remember michael Scott?
david Of course I do.
jan From the Scranton Branch.
michael jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
jan David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
rachel Excuse me.
michael Ok.
pam Oh. No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
bartender Oh, sorry. . push;
man So did the merger go smoothly, or?
michael It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
karen I'm the only one left. everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
michael Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
jan We're good. Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
rachel Can I get anyone anything, or?
michael I could go for an appeteaser.
jan Martini please.
michael Bagel bites or something.
karen Rachel, your house is beautiful.
rachel Thank you.
dwight What's the square footage?
david About 5, 000.
dwight Does that include the garage?
michael Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
dwight I'm just.
david I don't know
dwight It's a common question.
michael David, how much did this house cost?
dwight These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
rachel I'll show you around.
dwight Cool, let's start with the banisters.
karen Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
jim Yep.
karen That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
jim Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
karen And it didn't end well.
jim Gotcha. Alright.
david This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
michael Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.
jan You ok?
michael Yeah. Do you have any ice?
david Sure.
michael How about some Splenda?
roy One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
kenny Where?
roy On this side.
kevin No, it is definitely under one of these hands.
ryan I think I heard it on Roy's side.
kevin No, it is here.
ryan Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
kevin Good thing you didn't listen to me.
ryan Yeah, close one.
roy Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. Not here. .
kenny YES!
pam Nice job.
roy I can read you like a book.
pam Oh yeah?
roy You can't keep anything from me. Student 1
 Hey Creed.
creed Hey! What are you guys doing here? Student 2
 You're the man buddy.
creed I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
dwight Huh. Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? .
rachel Uh, that's a guest room.
dwight Just the one window?
rachel Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me.
dwight Are those real pearls?
rachel Uh, yes.
dwight Good.
jim Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
karen Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
jim Oh. Hadn't noticed.
karen Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
jim No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
michael This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
jan It's nice.
michael You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
jan I, Michael, I think david probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
michael Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis. there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
jim Oh.
michael Crazy.
jan I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
michael Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
jan Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just.
michael What are you doing?
jan Don't you know what I'm doing?
michael Yes, but you could tell me. What. What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
jan Shut up.
michael What has gotten into you?
jan Come on.
michael No, no, no.
jan What?
michael Come on, let's go back to the party.
jan Just let me loosen my dress.
michael Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
jan Michael.
michael No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
jan Slam me up against the wall, right here.
michael I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
jan Oh, please.
michael You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
jan Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.
toby Here.
pam Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
toby I was.
pam Hey, don't you have a daughter?
toby Yes.
dwight Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
child I don't know, it was here when I was born.
dwight I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
child I don't know.
dwight What do you know?
david God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
jim You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with david Wallace.
karen Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
jim Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? Wow. Ok. You got me.
karen I so got you.
jim So, none of them?
karen Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
jim Really?
karen Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.
jim Ok.
karen Hey Jan.
jan Not too good.
rachel Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad?
michael rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
david What's ah, what's with jan and Michael?
jim I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
dwight The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
roy What?
pam I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
roy That's awesome. That's what I want.
pam Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
roy I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
pam Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
roy What?
pam He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
roy jim came on to you?
pam Just listen.
roy No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
pam Don't yell!
roy Don't yell?!
pam This is over.
roy Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
kenny Damn jet skis!
michael Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle.
jan I feel sick.
michael You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
jan No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
michael Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
jan Please don't cry.
michael I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
jan It was never a love contract, michael and besides, I have already given a copy to david and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
michael I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
jan I didn't mean it. I was.
michael Whatever.
jan Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
michael That's all, you didn't mean it?
jan That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
michael I love you, Jan.
jan Ok.
dwight Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
roy Are they going to call the cops?
kenny No, I paid them off.
roy Jet ski money?
kenny All of it.
roy I'm gonna kill jim Halpert.
