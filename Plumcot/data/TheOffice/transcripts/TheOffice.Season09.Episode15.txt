pam_beesly Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.
jim_halpert It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
pam_beesly Alakazam!
jim_halpert By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
pam_beesly And, poof! He disappears.
erin_hannon Hey! Wanna play hookey today?
pete_miller Oh, maybe. What do you have in mind?
erin_hannon We can do anything you want.
erin_hannon I really wanna have fun today because tomorrow is going to be a nightmare. Andy's coming back from his stupid, dumb boat trip. He's been rude. He's been selfish. I think he's a big jerk. And I'm breaking up with him. Bam, Andy! How do you like me now?... I hope as a friend.
pete_miller Erin says she's gonna break up with Andy, but I'm not sure. He's coming back tomorrow and surprise, today, she wants to do whatever I'd like. You know, when I was a kid, we had a dog who go real sick and we had to 'send him to a farm'. And on his last day, we did everything he loved.
erin_hannon Wanna play catch in the parking lot?
pete_miller Sure.
erin_hannon Great.
pete_miller I'll get my coat.
erin_hannon Perfect.
dwight_schrute Come in.
dwight_schrute Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
dwight_schrute I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
dwight_schrute I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
kevin_malone Andy left a carton of milk in the fridge. So, I've been sneaking a little bit every day for the last three months. It's been yummy. But now, Andy's coming back. So, I guess it's goodbye chunky, lemon milk.
kevin_malone OK, I'll say it. I wish Andy had stayed on his trip.
nellie_bertram I say we all have one last fun boss-less day.
meredith_palmer Yeah, let's get some booze and some cocaine and just blow it out. No consequences.
phyllis_vance Or the mini mall. They have all these Valentine Day deals. You can get 20% off if you come in with your husband or your boyfriend. But, I mean, if you don't have one of those you can probably just bring whoever it is you use to kill your loneliness.
stanley_hudson Phil, I'll pretend to be your husband. I'm already sick of you, so it'll seem realistic.
phyllis_vance Oh...
angela_martin They have a nail salon there where I get my feet detailed. They use a watch repair kit.
kevin_malone Ew! I'll be your foot buddy.
nellie_bertram Everyone, it is our last day here with no manager. I say we go to the mini mall. Clark, you will be my fake boyfriend so I can get the discount.
clark It's what I do.
oscar_martinez Darryl, everyone seems to be pairing off. Do you want to pretend to be a couple so we get the...
darryl_philbin No... yes, yes. Why wouldn't I... wanna pretend to be gay? Got no problem with that.
oscar_martinez All right, it'll be easy. Don't be nervous, just follow my...
darryl_philbin Stop talking 'bout it. I said I'm fine with it.
pam_beesly These are gross.
jim_halpert They are terrible.
pam_beesly Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.
jim_halpert Oh my god. That's so romantic.
pam_beesly It's with Brian and Alyssa.
jim_halpert Oh my god. That's less romantic.
pam_beesly I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.
jim_halpert Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
pam_beesly That sounds nice.
jim_halpert I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.
nail_salon_manager stylist 1 Oh, tiny, poor lady is back. Oh, get the baby clipper.
nail_salon_manager stylist 2 You take off your glasses.
clark 'Kay.
nellie_bertram What?
nail_salon_manager stylist 2 Your boyfriend. He look like a pretty girl.
nellie_bertram My boyfriend does look like a pretty girl, doesn't he? Yes, a very little pretty girl. And you know what, now that you are developing, we should go and get you a training bra.
clark Oh, you guys think this is funny? You know what? No more discount. Excuse me. Full price. We're not together.
nellie_bertram Oh, come on!
clark She's living a lie.
nellie_bertram Turns out, I can't even be in a pretend relationship.
oscar_martinez Hi. We'd like a couples discount on a pair of foot massages.
nail_salon_manager manager No. No discount for two men. Two men are not a couple.
oscar_martinez We are together. Romantically.
nail_salon_manager manager Two men? Doesn't work. No discount.
darryl_philbin Oh, it works. Him and me, all right, we are crazy in love. More love than your small mind can comprehend. And we have two disposable incomes. And no kids. And we're taking our business elsewhere.
jim_halpert Hey, Brian.
brian Hey.
pam_beesly Sorry we're late.
brian Oh, uh, no problem. I finished all the bread.
pam_beesly Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.
jim_halpert Oh.
brian It's, uh, great to see you guys. Thanks for coming.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
brian It's fine. What are you gonna do, you know? But, if you guys know of any work, I'm fully available.
pam_beesly Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.
brian That's... OK, great. Does he pay well?
pam_beesly Where's Alyssa?
brian Uh, yeah. Um, you know, Alyssa's, she's not gonna make it today.
pam_beesly Oh.
brian Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
dwight_schrute I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
dwight_schrute Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
andy_bernard Hi Dwight.
dwight_schrute You're back. And you're disgusting.
phyllis_vance Ah, geez. My nails aren't dry yet. I don't think I can work for at least a couple hours.
andy_bernard Well, well, well, look who it is.
phyllis_vance Andy.
andy_bernard I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.
erin_hannon Andy!
andy_bernard Hey! Sweetheart! I have missed you so much.
erin_hannon Yes. Welcome back, buddy.
andy_bernard I have been dreaming of this moment.
erin_hannon Me too. So much. I'm so happy.
erin_hannon I am really, really bad at break ups. Technically, I'm still dating my first grade boyfriend. I mean, we just had our 20th anniversary. And, I forgot to get him something.
oscar_martinez What happened? We thought you were coming back tomorrow.
andy_bernard Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe.
dwight_schrute Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
andy_bernard Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.
clark Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
dwight_schrute No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
andy_bernard I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.
erin_hannon He only emailed me four times.
andy_bernard Question. Where's Jim?
phyllis_vance He and Pam are having their Valentine's Day lunch.
andy_bernard For two hours? Really?
oscar_martinez So, you're concerned about peoples' long absence from their place of work?
andy_bernard If the shoe fits.
brian We were telling two different versions of the same story. And then, everything just went numb.
jim_halpert Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
brian Yeah. That's the thing. When we were fighting, it weirdly felt like the relationship was still alive. And, it wasn't until we stopped fighting that, we realized that it was over. You know, it's over. I'm sorry, this is... oh my god, OK. We have to stop seeing each other like this. We have to find a different way to communicate other than breaking down in front of each other.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert What?
brian At least my crying won't get you fired.
jim_halpert Crying?
andy_bernard I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
andy_bernard And you sold it to Jan too.
dwight_schrute Yes!
andy_bernard I mean... I'm impressed.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
andy_bernard Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
dwight_schrute You were on a boat.
andy_bernard I was...
dwight_schrute On a boat.
andy_bernard That...
dwight_schrute In the ocean.
andy_bernard OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? Just say the word 'coolio'.
dwight_schrute I'm not gonna say it.
andy_bernard Say it.
dwight_schrute Not a word.
andy_bernard Coolio.
dwight_schrute No! What do you think you're doing?
andy_bernard Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
dwight_schrute Don't you dare! Andy!
jan_levinson Hello?
andy_bernard Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.
jan_levinson Oh, Andy.
andy_bernard I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.
jan_levinson Really?
andy_bernard Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.
jan_levinson Hmm.
dwight_schrute Coolio.
jan_levinson Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
dwight_schrute Coolio. Coolio.
andy_bernard No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
jan_levinson Yeah.
dwight_schrute Coolio.
andy_bernard It, it's, it's actually just an issue...
jan_levinson You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
dwight_schrute No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
andy_bernard Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...
jan_levinson Tell Angela to send me a final invoice.
andy_bernard Well, ah, ah...
dwight_schrute Please Ja, Ja...
andy_bernard Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.
andy_bernard Hey, everybody, great job. Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.
angela_martin Yes, well, as you know, we get paid on Fridays. And you haven't been here for 12 Fridays.
andy_bernard All right. Thank you very much. Looking good. Who's that little fella?
angela_martin It's a bonus check. For you. From Wallace. Because the branch exceeded it's targets over the past quarter.
andy_bernard Wow, that's wonderful!
oscar_martinez A quarter's three months. That's how long you've been gone.
andy_bernard Uh-huh.
angela_martin Uh-huh.
andy_bernard Uh-huh... Uh-huh. Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
dwight_schrute Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
clark Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
kevin_malone He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
dwight_schrute God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
dwight_schrute I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
nellie_bertram I'm not going to rat on him. No, Andy gave me a second chance. So, the least I could do is let somebody else rat on him. Meredith, why don't you?
meredith_palmer Meredith Palmer ain't never been called no nark. Floozy? Yes. Alkie? Check. Einstein sarcastically? You bet. But never no nark. Vomit mop? Sure. Floor meat? That's me. Flesh hoover?
erin_hannon Hey!
pete_miller Meredith, that's plenty. All right? That's more than plenty. Why does no one stop her?
erin_hannon Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
dwight_schrute Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
andy_bernard What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! All right. Back to work.
pam_beesly OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?
jim_halpert I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.
pam_beesly I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.
jim_halpert Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.
pam_beesly It's not Brian's fault.
jim_halpert No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
pam_beesly OK.
andy_bernard I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
dwight_schrute Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
andy_bernard Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?
david_wallace Wallace Hey guys.
andy_bernard Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.
david_wallace Wallace Sounds great. Don't let me interrupt. What ever you guys have been doing this last quarter, I couldn't be happier with the numbers.
andy_bernard Thank you.
david_wallace Wallace Well, finish up. I'm gonna meet with Val about that warehouse guy you had to let go and you and I will talk in 15 minutes?
andy_bernard Great!
david_wallace Wallace Great job, everybody!
andy_bernard We had to let a warehouse guy go?!
kevin_malone You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...
dwight_schrute ... lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
andy_bernard What?!
dwight_schrute Yeah.
andy_bernard There was a fire in the warehouse?
dwight_schrute The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
kevin_malone Whoa.
andy_bernard This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?
phyllis_vance We started selling balloons.
andy_bernard What?!
clark Yeah. And, uh, Kathy Ireland signed on as the official spokes-babe of Dunder-Mifflin.
andy_bernard No kidding?
clark Yeah. In the European billboards, she's gonna be topless.
andy_bernard Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.
clark They're tasteful.
andy_bernard Good, good. What else?
andy_bernard Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.
david_wallace Wallace What fire?
andy_bernard The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.
david_wallace Wallace It looked fine to me.
andy_bernard I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.
david_wallace Wallace OK.
andy_bernard I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.
david_wallace Wallace Thanks, Andy.
andy_bernard Thank you.
david_wallace Wallace All right. Everyone!
erin_hannon Fish sounds great.
andy_bernard Yeah, I guess.
erin_hannon Really playing the scales, huh?
andy_bernard Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?
erin_hannon I don't love you anymore.
andy_bernard What?
erin_hannon I still like you, but you were gone a really long time. And, you didn't really email me all that much. You retweeted me, a lot to be fair. But I don't love you.
andy_bernard OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.
erin_hannon I just said there isn't love.
andy_bernard On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.
erin_hannon I guess.
andy_bernard I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.
erin_hannon You got really sunburned.
andy_bernard I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.
erin_hannon Ugh.
andy_bernard I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.
erin_hannon You really think we can get that back?
andy_bernard Yes. Come on. Totally.
jim_halpert You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.
pam_beesly Oh?
jim_halpert Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
pam_beesly Are you sure?
jim_halpert I just feel like we're gonna fight.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert So... how 'bout let's not?
pam_beesly OK.
jim_halpert Oh, um. Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
pam_beesly Wow. I didn't know you kept this.
jim_halpert Yeah, yeah.
pam_beesly Thank you.
jim_halpert No problem.
pam_beesly I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.
jim_halpert You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?
pam_beesly Yeah, I do.
jim_halpert OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
erin_hannon Hi.
pete_miller Hey, you OK?
erin_hannon I couldn't do it.
pete_miller Oh.
erin_hannon I'm sorry.
pete_miller Oh, you don't have to apologize. I just... I just want you to be happy. OK?
erin_hannon We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
david_wallace Wallace Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
