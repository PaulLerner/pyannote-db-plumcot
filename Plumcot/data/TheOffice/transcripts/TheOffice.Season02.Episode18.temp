pam I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. . Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.

pam I reminded you last night.
michael Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in "Raw, " and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in "Daddy Daycare. " both great movies, but, still.

stanley Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
michael Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the. frat boys away from her.
melissa I'm in eighth grade.
michael Oh.
stanley She's in middle school.
michael Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
michael It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
michael They want how many spiral pads?
meredith Um, fif--well, fifty. I. over ordered because they had a back order.
michael Okay.
meredith I got permission to bring jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
angela Can you put that down there?
kelly Yep.
toby Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
sasha Do you need any help?
angela No. Thanks. We'd. have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
toby Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh. let's go draw.
kelly Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
angela I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
kelly God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
ryan kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for kelly is. getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
michael Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. . Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
pam Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
abby No thanks.
pam I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
jim What are you reading?
abby From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.
jim Aww, best book?
abby Yeah, but I've read it before.
jim Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
abby Definitely the Aquarium.
jim Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. . You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.

jake Do you have any computer games?
dwight No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
jake Yeah, meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here.
dwight You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
jake Whatever, okay?
dwight You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
jake That's your name? Mister Poop?
dwight Schrute. Mister Schrute.
jake Sure, Mister Poop.
dwight . Schrute.
sasha Are you Mother Goose?
melissa I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else.
ryan Wow.
melissa There's a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there?
ryan No.
melissa You've never been to Jitters? Ryan, you are so dorky. Gimme your number, so I can text you.
ryan Uhm.
melissa Come on! You have an email address?
kelly . that I thought you should know .
stanley Mmhmm. What?
kelly I think something a little fishy is going on.
stanley A little fishy?
kelly Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe .
stanley That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
ryan Yes, I--
stanley Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
ryan Okay.
ryan stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
dwight That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat. a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
michael Dwight! Dwight!
dwight There's a photo.
michael What the hell are you reading to them?
dwight These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
michael Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
sasha What's a Nazi?
michael What's a Nazi?
dwight Nazi was a fascist movement.
michael Don't!
dwight . from the 1930's.
michael Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
dwight I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
michael Why don't you just leave? Okay?
dwight . Okay.
jake Bye, Mister Poop.
michael Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? The
kids I do, I do!
michael Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, michael Scott is freaking cool.
angela You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities . . push;
michael This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
melissa So. you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
michael No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
abby That's not fair.
michael Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate.
jake You're just a middleman.
michael I'm not just a middle. man.
melissa Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?
michael You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
dwight We have better service than they do!
michael . There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of. something. Right?
creed That is correct.
michael Say hi to the kids.
creed Hi kids.
michael Yaaaaay.
creed Have you ever seen a foot with four toes?
kids Ewwww!
michael What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
creed Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
michael No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed. Creed, okay?
michael You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I . used to be . the star of a kids show.
kids No way.
michael It's true. I did.
melissa You serious?
jake Really?
michael I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
abby That doesn't sound like a show.
melissa What?!
michael It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. Ryan, can you come here a second? I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
ryan Right. Okay.
michael I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
ryan Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so.
melissa You know, I can go with him.
michael Oka--
ryan No! I will. go.
michael Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
michael Alright, nowwww. what kind. of pizza do you like?
michael I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives. They're adults, for God's sake.
michael I am going to give you a little blast from the past of michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle. ' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan? Miss
trudy . Bundle, are you ready to come on in? Let's have some fun!
michael That. is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can. fast forward. And. I want you. to.

pam He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
jim Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
roy Pam! Pam! I love this guy! Come on!
pam So, Melissa. I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice.
melissa Who? Terry?
pam Mmhmm.
melissa That woman is not my mother. That is my step-mother.
jake Mister Poop, I have to tell you something.
dwight Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
jake You're ugly.
dwight Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So.
jake Meredith!
michael Yeah?
toby I think these belong to you.
michael Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
toby Believe me, she has enough toys. she doesn't need your watch.
michael Thank you.
toby Is everything okay?
michael You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
toby Uh. it's true.
michael Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
toby Mmhmm.
michael Tell me something honestly, do you. think. that it is too late for me to have kids?
toby Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
michael What about.
toby Not Jan.
michael . Jan. Kay.
toby If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow. foster parent, or something.
michael . Or biologically.
toby Somehow.
michael Thanks, that's, no, that. that really means a lot to me. Hey, does sasha have a godfather, because I.
toby Yes.
michael Oh. kay.
jake Is it okay if I take one?
pam Sure.
jake Thank you.
pam You're welcome.
jake Is your job hard?

jake That's so cool, yeah!
pam Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
jake That's so awesome!
pam I know.
michael Yes, it is true. I, michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And. I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
kevin Go ahead.
abby Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
jim Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time?
kevin What're you doing? You never have plans.
jim Thanks, Kev. Uhm. I'm actually going on a date.
kevin Niiice.
michael Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
michael You. who are on the road. must have a code. that you can live by. and so. become yourself. because the past. is just a goodbye. and teach. your children well.
jim Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
pam I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. michael and
dwight . did slowly go by. and feed. them on your dreams.
pam My theory is that. michael and
dwight . The one they picked. the one you'll know by. don't you ever ask them why. if I told you would cry. you never look at them and sigh. and know they love you.
dwight And they do, your parents, love you very much.
michael One more time. You.
dwight The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. They didn't eat the children.
