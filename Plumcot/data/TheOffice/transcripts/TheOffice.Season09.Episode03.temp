jim Morning, dwight
dwight Who are you? Fake
jim Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight.
dwight You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian Fake
jim You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race.
dwight Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday? Fake
jim Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me.
voicemail Please enter your password.
voicemail You have one new message.
dwight How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders! Fake
jim Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work.
dwight You don't work here! You're not Jim!
pam Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico's at 7
 30. Fake
jim Oh great, can't wait.
pam Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
dwight I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
dwight Oh my—! Oh d—! Oh, how did—? Huhhhhh!
erin Heyyy! Study buddies!
darryl Oh, ok.
erin Getting things done. Awesome!
darryl It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
darryl Since andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let's knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
erin S"il vous plait. dites-Moi. Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
dwight Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
erin I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
dwight You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
dwight Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
dwight I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
erin Yeah! Let's do it!
dwight Atherozar!
erin Oh!
dwight It means "excellent". And we have begun.
pam . Is everything okay?
nellie Hmm? Oh—oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine. I'm mean, I d—I just don't wanna—burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
pam Great.
nellie It's just that I am taking my driver's license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to "Demandy". . I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But. in who's car?
andy Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
nellie 
pam Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
nellie Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior! nellie and
pam ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
pam I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
jim Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
nellie This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree. com
andy Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
nellie Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
andy As in.
nellie Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
andy Wow!
andy This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
andy My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
erin I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, "What's your stance on politics?" Or, "What is the best war to do?" And, I will just be like, "Duhhhh!"
andy Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh. I'm related to Michelle Obama.
pete Yeah we noticed early on, andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
clark So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
clark Oooohhhhhhhh!
clark It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
pete Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
clark Just clap through it, man.
darryl You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
jim That was really good, Darryl.
darryl Life hacking, man.
andy There he is!
jim Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me—.
andy Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
darryl Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
andy It's me! I am related to Michelle Obama.
darryl What?! Really?
andy I mean, it's distant, but.
darryl Huh ha! That's cool, man.
andy Right?
andy darryl said, "Cool, man. " He called me as cool man.
pam You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
nellie Mmmm—the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I'm driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
pam Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
nellie Whhooooo!
oscar I'm just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
phyllis You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
stanley Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
dwight I throat-rip.
erin Foth aggendak!
dwight You throat-rip.
erin Foth aggendi!
dwight He/she/it throat rips.
erin Foth aggenda!
dwight More of a, barbaric growl.
erin Forth aggenda!
dwight Louder! You're shouting it from the back of a horse!
erin Wah!! Aggenda!!
pam Pretty crazy about andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
nellie Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable!
pam What?
nellie Well, you know how andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
pam Sure.
nellie Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
pam So he's not related to Michelle Obama?
nellie Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
pam 
pam Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
nellie Pam! .
pam 
oscar Well, if there's another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I—
andy What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! .
oscar Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
andy Why? Is it employee's day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
oscar Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain. negative connotations. Most likely, your family were—slave owners.
andy Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
darryl Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
andy Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye. Where were we? Uhhhh, yes. Okay. Your. productivity thing.
darryl Yes, yes, yes.
andy Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!
darryl I included some time saving ideas.
andy Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
darryl Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
andy Right on, brotha. Wurddd.
erin Addor!
dwight Daraas!
erin Qazer!
dwight Daraas! Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?
pete Hey Erin!
erin Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
pete Oh—okay. Sorry. . push;
nellie Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
pam Yeah—turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again—those are the wipers. So—the—its—just. There you go! Yeah. Yeah, things get so busy with the kids—red light—that it's nice to have that creative outlet—red light! Red light! Red! Red!
nellie That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
pam Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is. the mural I did for Angela's baby.
nellie That's amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
pam angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
andy . Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
erin Vos!
andy So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
erin Because of your slaves.
andy Not my slaves, my ancestors'. Maybe. Probably not.
erin Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for "slave master", "attafrauk!", is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
andy That you're learning a made-up language from HBO's Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today. but this was a great nerd-out!
erin Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
dwight People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
andy Hi guys.
phyllis Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
andy Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
andy Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be—. Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes" by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith—African American—Mambazo.
pam Good. Very good. Oh—no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. "New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A. S. A. P. " And then in parentheses, he wrote out "as soon as possible. "
nellie Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, "looking for dirt. "
pam Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
nellie Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding.
pam Oh—gee—I'm—
nellie No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! I love it.
pam Brilliant!
nellie What should we say about Jim?
pam Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
nellie My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. I just made a joke there.
pam I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there's something jim isn't telling me.
nellie Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
pam Jim? No.
nellie . How can you be sure?
pam Because he just loves me too much.
nellie You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
andy I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol' family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
angela Ew.
andy kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
kevin And John Wayne?
andy No. Not that I see here.
kevin Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
andy You mean Dwayne? And no. What about jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
jim pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True— Oh no.
andy Dwight's grandfather was a—.
dwight Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So.
andy I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
dwight Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
andy And meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
meredith Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
angela Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
phyllis Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
kevin Yeah, that—you're being really mean, Andy.
dwight Yeah, Andy.
andy No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.
oscar The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
andy Might've done. And how. do you figure?
oscar Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
andy You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society. if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income. Okay, kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie. Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south? She said no! Take that! Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way? I just asked you! Why didn't you just say that? Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That's—no! I don't wanna know that. Ok. You're interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye. Well, turns out the Bernard's of yore did not own slaves.
oscar Really?
andy We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
andy Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
darryl You're gonna po' mouth
andy Exactly. Help me po' mouth, Darryl.
darryl Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions—
andy What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
darryl That could work.
andy You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.
darryl I'm going for a walk.
andy Okay.
pam Good. Good. And—
jim You doing alright, man?
darryl I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
jim Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
darryl It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
jim Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
darryl Hmm. Yeah right
jim No, I'm serious. There's always something better.
darryl Like what?
jim Like hypothetically. if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
darryl What kind of job?
jim Something cool. Like, sports marketing or. that sound something like you'd be into?
darryl Hell yeah!
jim Right?
darryl That sounds awesome!
jim Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to.
darryl I love Philly!
jim Right?
darryl It's not even a thought—
jim Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
darryl What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
jim Oh, it's happening! Let's just keep it between you and me for right now.
darryl Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it?
jim We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's—I think she understands. what this is.
darryl Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
jim What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
darryl It's not real. until your wife is on board.
pam So what did you want to show me?
nellie That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
pam Yeah. It's really ugly
nellie Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking. a mural.
pam You mean me?
nellie Yes! You! You are soo talented! It's going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton's most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
pam Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I—Nellie, this is brilliant! Hey!
jim Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
nellie Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
pam What?! No! I-I got this. Okay?
nellie This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
nellie And Filipino. But we'll break that to her later.
nellie You know what this is all about.
darryl Yeah. You too, huh?
nellie Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
darryl Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too. Yeah.
nellie Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
jim I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
pam I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
pam I was helping nellie drive—
stanley Do not care.
pete Fonas chek!
erin Dothraas! chek!
andy I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
erin Hmmm!
