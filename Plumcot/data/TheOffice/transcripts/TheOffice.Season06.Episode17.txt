pam_beesly I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave... Yeah, I'm pregnant... Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.
dwight_schrute Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
jim_halpert Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely.
dwight_schrute No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!
pam_beesly There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.
dwight_schrute Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.
dwight_schrute I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
pam_beesly Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
kevin_malone I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
pam_beesly Hmm.
kevin_malone Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
kevin_malone I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.
pam_beesly Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?
kevin_malone I think it should be a surprise.
meredith_palmer Oh, getting there, huh?
pam_beesly No, no. I still have time.
pam_beesly I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
jim_halpert Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
pam_beesly If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
jim_halpert Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
pam_beesly I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
pam_beesly Ooh.
michael_scott Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...
jim_halpert Michael.
michael_scott Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
jim_halpert Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
michael_scott Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
pam_beesly You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
michael_scott Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
jim_halpert Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.
michael_scott Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!
pam_beesly Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.
erin_hannon Ooh, spooky. But why?
jim_halpert Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
pam_beesly Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.
nick Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.
michael_scott Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
angela_martin What are you looking at?
dwight_schrute Ha, nerd.
kelly_kapoor Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
dwight_schrute Bare my child.
angela_martin Excuse me?
dwight_schrute I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4 00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
jim_halpert That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.
pam_beesly Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.
jim_halpert Are you serious? Pam.
pam_beesly No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
jim_halpert I... Pam, please.
pam_beesly I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
andy_bernard Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate.
pam_beesly Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.
jim_halpert Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
pam_beesly Five minutes apart.
jim_halpert So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
pam_beesly Okay, stop watching me.
jim_halpert Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
pam_beesly Not until midnight.
andy_bernard Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
erin_hannon I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
andy_bernard My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
jim_halpert You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
michael_scott No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
jim_halpert Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
pam_beesly Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
michael_scott Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!
michael_scott Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
michael_scott The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
andy_bernard Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
michael_scott I will allow that.
andy_bernard Yes! Can anyone do those?
stanley_hudson I'm going to go look at the Internet.
jim_halpert Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one.
pam_beesly Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.
michael_scott Okay.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
pam_beesly Oh, thanks, Kelly.
michael_scott Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
pam_beesly Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
michael_scott Yes, Phyl?
phyllis_vance I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
michael_scott Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
andy_bernard I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
michael_scott That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.
andy_bernard Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay... You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance.
ryan_howard "You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home."
erin_hannon Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox... And... I know this. Uh... The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.
angela_martin Good afternoon.
dwight_schrute Have a seat.
angela_martin What is this?
dwight_schrute Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
angela_martin Of course.
dwight_schrute It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
angela_martin You know I was thinking...
dwight_schrute Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?
angela_martin Agreed.
michael_scott Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
kevin_malone For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
jim_halpert Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know...
pam_beesly Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.
michael_scott Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.
erin_hannon Um, stimulate the nipples.
michael_scott Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
kevin_malone Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
meredith_palmer I have a shirt like that in my car.
michael_scott Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
erin_hannon Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
michael_scott Okay, the opposite of that?
kevin_malone Stick spicy food up her butt.
jim_halpert Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
pam_beesly Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
jim_halpert Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.
pam_beesly Why don't you go do some work?
jim_halpert Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled.
pam_beesly I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
jim_halpert No, I don't.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally.
michael_scott Ooh, someone's freakin'.
andy_bernard A little frazzled.
michael_scott I think he is.
jim_halpert I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes.
dwight_schrute Acceptable names include and are limited to Ebenezer.
angela_martin Jedediah.
dwight_schrute Jonas.
angela_martin Jedediah.
dwight_schrute Warf.
angela_martin No Star Trek names.
dwight_schrute Okay. Fine.
angela_martin What if it's a girl?
dwight_schrute Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.
angela_martin Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.
dwight_schrute Yes you can.
angela_martin No.
dwight_schrute It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after s*x, and then extremely cold for five months.
angela_martin Absolutely not.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
jim_halpert Ah, you know me too well.
pam_beesly Okay, Jim.
jim_halpert Yeah? ... Oh.
pam_beesly Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?
jim_halpert Did you say "she?"
pam_beesly I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait... Oh, God, don't be mad.
jim_halpert Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man.
pam_beesly I know.
jim_halpert Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.
pam_beesly Good.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Alright... Hey, did you change?
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, my water broke.
jim_halpert Oh. Oh...
pam_beesly Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.
michael_scott Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?
phyllis_vance No, it's 4 35.
michael_scott 4 35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have s*x like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
pam_beesly No, not yet, Michael.
michael_scott We can do...
pam_beesly Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?
michael_scott Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
oscar_martinez That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
michael_scott What is October feast?
pam_beesly There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
kevin_malone Our ultra feast menu's theme Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay?
pam_beesly Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
michael_scott Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
jim_halpert Alright. Time to go. Okay.
michael_scott That's right, let's do this.
jim_halpert Let's give it a shot.
pam_beesly Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.
jim_halpert Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital.
pam_beesly They're not that bad still, babe.
jim_halpert Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital.
pam_beesly No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.
jim_halpert Come on, Michael says we should go now.
michael_scott Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.
pam_beesly No, it's passing, it's fine.
jim_halpert Pam.
pam_beesly Ah, no, it passed. It's good.
jim_halpert You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.
pam_beesly Okay, I'm not going. I'm not... It's fine. Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
jim_halpert Hey, are you kidding me?
michael_scott Are you kidding?
jim_halpert If anyone can do this, you can do this.
michael_scott You can do this. You can do this.
jim_halpert Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared.
michael_scott I'm scared, too.
kevin_malone I'm petrified.
jim_halpert The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert A really awesome baby.
michael_scott We're going to have a baby.
jim_halpert So let's have it at the hospital.
michael_scott Let's do that.
jim_halpert How are we doing on contractions?
michael_scott Two minutes apart.
jim_halpert Two minutes...
pam_beesly Oh, God. Oh, no.
jim_halpert Michael, I told you.
michael_scott It's okay.
jim_halpert No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
pam_beesly Jim, we waited too long!
michael_scott I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.
jim_halpert We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
michael_scott We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?
pam_beesly I don't want to have my baby here.
michael_scott You're not going to. You know where you're going?
pam_beesly The hospital.
michael_scott Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?
pam_beesly A baby.
michael_scott Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
michael_scott I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!
dwight_schrute No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
jim_halpert Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
michael_scott No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.
jim_halpert Alright, I have my wallet.
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert Go bag's in the car... Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
michael_scott Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?
erin_hannon There's nothing in it.
michael_scott You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
oscar_martinez The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
dwight_schrute Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!
pam_beesly Dwight, get away!
michael_scott No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
erin_hannon I didn't know we had a tape measure.
dwight_schrute "We" don't.
jim_halpert Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here.
Dwight,#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode17 Jim and Michael Here we go!
phyllis_vance Good luck!
nick Good luck, Pam!
michael_scott Thank you! Wish me luck!
creed_bratton Have fun!
meredith_palmer Hey, it's 5 00!
michael_scott Here we go! Here we go! On our way!
stanley_hudson Hold it!
michael_scott Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!
toby_flenderson Oh, one more!
michael_scott No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot.
michael_scott Dwight, what is the traffic like?
dwight_schrute Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!
michael_scott Alright.
dwight_schrute Let's go!
michael_scott Geesh, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Michael!
michael_scott What!?
dwight_schrute This is where I saw that deer last week.
michael_scott Where?
dwight_schrute Right over by that fence.
michael_scott By the bushes?
jim_halpert Okay, Michael! Focus!
michael_scott Okay, go, go, go, go!
dwight_schrute Let's go!
dwight_schrute I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.
jim_halpert Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.
michael_scott Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.
pam_beesly Michael!
michael_scott Yeah?
pam_beesly Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.
jim_halpert Michael, come on!
michael_scott I'm texting about you, okay!?
dwight_schrute Ugh, alright. Let's move! ... What?
police_officer Pull over!
dwight_schrute Are you kidding me?
police_officer Pull over! You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer! Don't make this difficult, Dwight!
pam_beesly Wait, wait. My iPod's not in here!
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly It has the birth song on it!
jim_halpert Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine.
pam_beesly Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
jim_halpert Okay, so what do you want to do?
pam_beesly I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
jim_halpert Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now.
michael_scott Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. Ready?
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute.
michael_scott Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.
dwight_schrute Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under...
dwight_schrute I don't need a key.
pam_beesly Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
dwight_schrute No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
pam_beesly Dwight just listen! It's underneath...
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert Wait, you alright?
pam_beesly Yes.
michael_scott Do you have everything, guys?
jim_halpert Michael, just go park the car.
michael_scott Okay, alright.
hospital_employee employee Sir! You can't park here!
michael_scott Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. I just did.
