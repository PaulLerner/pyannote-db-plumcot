pam_beesly Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
jim_halpert Oh, great. "Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy." Oh that's not good.
phyllis_vance Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
pam_beesly It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
jim_halpert Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
pam_beesly Yeah he does.
oscar_martinez Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
pam_beesly Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
phyllis_vance Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
pam_beesly Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
jim_halpert Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
angela_martin 'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
pam_beesly Okay, which one of these looks more right?
dwight_schrute Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
gabe_lewis Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
jim_halpert Okay, quick. Who says moustache?
dwight_schrute Yep.
jim_halpert Who says no moustache?
gabe_lewis Ah! Ha ha ha!
phyllis_vance He does have a moustache.
dwight_schrute Yes!
pam_beesly Welcome back, Stanley.
robert_california "Good morning, Robert," says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. Pam!
pam_beesly Oh!
robert_california Is this a video conference you're having with "Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz"?
pam_beesly Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
robert_california People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
nellie_bertram Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
robert_california Nellie, really, nine fifty?
nellie_bertram Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
robert_california Ah.
nellie_bertram Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
robert_california I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
nellie_bertram Ah ha!
robert_california I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
nellie_bertram Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
robert_california No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.
nellie_bertram Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
kevin_malone & Meredith Yes.
nellie_bertram Ugh! I hate that! No offense.
kevin_malone None taken.
oscar_martinez Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
nellie_bertram oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
stanley_hudson Who's a native?
nellie_bertram Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court.
oscar_martinez What does that mean?
dwight_schrute Okay, okay.
nellie_bertram If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
robert_california Nellie?
nellie_bertram Yes, Robert!
robert_california You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
nellie_bertram Yeah.
robert_california Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.
dwight_schrute Why Jim?
robert_california The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
pam_beesly I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
jim_halpert I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
pam_beesly I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
jim_halpert Why is she here?
andy_bernard Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
erin_hannon Going to Pennsylvania.
andy_bernard On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
erin_hannon Oh. That must be nice.
andy_bernard Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
erin_hannon Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
andy_bernard Oh. Hmm.
andy_bernard Time to have a little kiss!
erin_hannon No.
andy_bernard Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
erin_hannon Yes.
andy_bernard I believe in that.
erin_hannon Yes. So do I.
andy_bernard I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
erin_hannon Important.
andy_bernard Mm-hmm.
phyllis_vance I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
pam_beesly I know, right?
oscar_martinez She's always late, she's always rude...
phyllis_vance It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
oscar_martinez Yeah.
phyllis_vance On purpose.
pam_beesly Phyllis!
angela_martin We should do it right here in the break room.
phyllis_vance Order carrot cake.
andy_bernard ...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
erin_hannon Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
andy_bernard Consider it nailed.
erin_hannon I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
andy_bernard Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
erin_hannon What?
andy_bernard I just need you to know-
erin_hannon What is it? I didn't sleep well last night.
dwight_schrute Ugh! Ow.
jim_halpert Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
dwight_schrute Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is."
jim_halpert That was one time-
dwight_schrute I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
nellie_bertram Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
jim_halpert Excuse me, one second. Hi.
pam_beesly Hey, what's up?
jim_halpert Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
dwight_schrute Haulin' cube!
jim_halpert That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
pam_beesly So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
jim_halpert Sounds like every other party.
pam_beesly No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
jim_halpert Oh! Hire a magician.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert Trust me.
pam_beesly Okay.
andy_bernard Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
lauren Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?
andy_bernard Hey, Lauren. Look at you.
lauren Well, I know. Look at me.
andy_bernard I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
lauren Aww!
andy_bernard Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
lauren Oh. God.
erin_hannon So, I'm Erin. Hi.
andy_bernard Yep. This is Erin.
lauren Nice to meet you. Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here!
erin_hannon Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
andy_bernard Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
lauren Oh, Jess! Look who stopped by after his business trip!
jessica Andy! Hey!
dwight_schrute I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
jim_halpert Yes, you should.
dwight_schrute Ooh.
jim_halpert "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie."
dwight_schrute I have to see these shoes.
jim_halpert I doubt that they're sh-
dwight_schrute Oh!
jim_halpert Whoa. Who is this guy?
dwight_schrute Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
jim_halpert Boyfriend.
dwight_schrute Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
jim_halpert Like a boyfriend?
dwight_schrute You read my mind.
jim_halpert Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
dwight_schrute Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
jim_halpert Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
nellie_bertram Oh.
jim_halpert Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
nellie_bertram I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
dwight_schrute Why not call...
jim_halpert Shh!
nellie_bertram God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
dwight_schrute That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
jim_halpert Dwight!
nellie_bertram I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
jim_halpert I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
dwight_schrute If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
nellie_bertram Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
jim_halpert No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
nellie_bertram God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
jim_halpert You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
pam_beesly What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
jim_halpert No, that's not what I-
nellie_bertram Jim, could you give us a hand?
jim_halpert Absolutely. Yeah. Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
pam_beesly Oh, okay. Okay, I will.
angela_martin Pam, we have a great idea.
oscar_martinez Listen to this.
angela_martin We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
pam_beesly Or what if...
angela_martin Okay.
pam_beesly We discuss... the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. Not mean.
angela_martin I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
oscar_martinez We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
pam_beesly What are you talking about? Yes we can.
oscar_martinez What I mean to say is we don't want to.
phyllis_vance Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
lauren Suck it!
erin_hannon Andy-
andy_bernard It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy pen1s?
erin_hannon No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
andy_bernard These are delicious.
erin_hannon But... they're penises.
lauren And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together.
andy_bernard Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
bachelorette_party_guest guests No, pop it. Pop it!
jessica Hey.
andy_bernard Hey.
jessica Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
megan Ahh!
andy_bernard Oh! Ah, Megan.
megan You are one of the good ones, nard dog.
andy_bernard Aww.
megan No, really. Where's my Andy?
jessica I dunno.
andy_bernard Oh, he's out there.
megan Aww. Are you going to sing for us?
andy_bernard Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
megan That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!
andy_bernard By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
pam_beesly Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle?
darryl_philbin Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
ryan_howard Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
oscar_martinez Plus everyone would know who you meant.
ryan_howard Yeah!
pam_beesly No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
angela_martin Nobody's named Monday.
ryan_howard Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
pam_beesly 'Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
kevin_malone Shh, here she comes!
all@ Hey!
phyllis_vance Welcome to your party.
creed_bratton Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long.
creed_bratton Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, "Have you heard my originals? They're terrible." They said, "Even better." I said, "I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie."
erin_hannon Maybe we should just go.
andy_bernard No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
jessica Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
andy_bernard Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
jessica Uh, yeah. What is it?
andy_bernard Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
jessica You're breaking up with me?
andy_bernard Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
jessica Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
andy_bernard Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
jessica What?
andy_bernard I am gay, and I prefer men.
kenny I knew it!
andy_bernard You did not, Kenny!
kenny You invited me to go shopping with you.
andy_bernard I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
jessica Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
andy_bernard Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
jessica I can't say it doesn't make sense...
andy_bernard Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
jessica Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
andy_bernard Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. So... we should probably... go.
robert_california This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
oscar_martinez To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
robert_california Cheers.
nellie_bertram Why thank you.
oscar_martinez Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
all@ Cheers.
angela_martin Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died.
jim_halpert Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
creed_bratton We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
all@ We hate Pam! We hate Pam!
the_magician So we've established-
jim_halpert No. No.
the_magician -that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just... disappear?
pam_beesly Oh!
erin_hannon That was a really rough scene.
andy_bernard Right? Rough scene.
erin_hannon Yeah.
andy_bernard Oh... at least we can kiss now.
erin_hannon Oh, yeah.
andy_bernard You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
erin_hannon Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
andy_bernard Yeah.
erin_hannon Probably from seeing that turkey.
andy_bernard Oh yeah.
erin_hannon When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
the_magician Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?
jim_halpert Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
robert_california no, Nellie, she-
jim_halpert I'll do it.
the_magician Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is.
jim_halpert It's the four of hearts.
robert_california Oh, no, you-
the_magician Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?
robert_california Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
the_magician Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory.
jim_halpert Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
the_magician But I never could seem to figure out those knots.
pam_beesly That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
the_magician What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-
dwight_schrute Okay scram, wizard.
the_magician What?
dwight_schrute You heard me!
the_magician Huh!
robert_california Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
nellie_bertram Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
robert_california Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.
kevin_malone You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
erin_hannon What? Why are we-
andy_bernard I just gotta do one thing.
megan Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who's here.
jessica What are you doing here?
andy_bernard Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
megan Why the hell did you come back here?
jessica Go away.
kenny Get lost!
meredith_palmer Get out!
andy_bernard Okay.
lauren You're done!
andy_bernard Bye guys.
lauren Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? Yeah, run away!
kenny You're disgusting!
lauren I can't believe you're not gay!
kenny Yeah get out of here.
all@ Don't come back.
erin_hannon Uh-oh!
all@ You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!
pam_beesly Hey Hank.
hank Yes ma'am.
pam_beesly I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
hank Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open.
jim_halpert Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
hank What? That ain't right.
pam_beesly Yeah, he came and went.
hank Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been...
pam_beesly Let's just- let's go.
jim_halpert Night-night.
