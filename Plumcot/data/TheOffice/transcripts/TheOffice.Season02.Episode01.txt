michael_scott Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, "Hey, did you get an award?" And the neighbor will say, "No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me." Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...
jim_halpert So, you ready for the... the Dundies?
pam_beesly Ugh...
pam_beesly You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.
michael_scott Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.
jim_halpert What?
michael_scott Fat Halpert. Jim Halpert.
michael_scott So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?
jim_halpert Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.
michael_scott Oh, that's a good idea.
dwight_schrute Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
michael_scott Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
michael_scott T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say "Don't go there" but that's... lame.
michael_scott And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.
stanley_hudson I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.
michael_scott Oh, no you di-int.
stanley_hudson I think I did.
michael_scott W-why did you...
stanley_hudson Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember?
michael_scott Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage, someone had eaten all of them.
michael_scott To Oscar Martinez it's the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah!
pam_beesly Michael has taped every Dundies awards and now, he's making me look through hours of footage to find highlights.
oscar_martinez That's supposed to be confidential.
michael_scott He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
michael_scott A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...
michael_scott ...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.
michael_scott ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
kelly_kapoor It was you.
phyllis_vance Live and learn.
pam_beesly It wasn't. I swear.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, it was.
dwight_schrute So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
pam_beesly We're not laughing at you, Dwight.
dwight_schrute So who are we laughing at?
pam_beesly Um, just something somebody wrote.
dwight_schrute Who? Dave Barry?
kelly_kapoor No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
dwight_schrute What is it? Who wrote it?
pam_beesly Um, it's kind of private.
phyllis_vance It's about Michael.
dwight_schrute That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
pam_beesly Okay, now I'm laughing at you.
michael_scott Will her highness, Jan Levinson-Gould, be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?
jan_levinson It's a, it's, it's a two and a half hour drive from New York, Michael.
michael_scott Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
jan_levinson No.
michael_scott Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
jan_levinson No, we don't approve of this Michael. I mean, y-you only had the budget for one office party a year, so... we're not paying for this.
michael_scott Um...
michael_scott Could you...?
jan_levinson Are you there Michael?
michael_scott Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
michael_scott Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
michael_scott ...come on, Jan!
michael_scott You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
jan_levinson Really? I'm dropping an atomic bomb on you?
michael_scott Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
jan_levinson You already had a party on May 5th for no reason.
michael_scott No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
jan_levinson And you had a luau....
michael_scott ...it happens once every billion years.
jan_levinson And a tsunami relief fundraiser which somehow lost a lot of money.
michael_scott Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
jan_levinson Okay, well, I don't understand why anyone would have a tsunami FUN raiser, Michael. I mean, that doesn't even make sense.
michael_scott Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
michael_scott This is a little character I like to do , it is, uh, loosely based on Karnack, one of Carson's classic characters. Here we go. The PLO, the IRA, and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse. "Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin." Here's the problem. There's no open bar because of Jan and it's the reason why comedy clubs have a two drink minimum. It'll be fine, I just...wish people were going to be drunk.
phyllis_vance Dwight, get out of here!!
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no...
phyllis_vance What were you doing in the ladies room?!
dwight_schrute ...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
phyllis_vance Why were you peering over the stalls?!
dwight_schrute No, why were you in there?!
phyllis_vance You are a pervert!
dwight_schrute What were you doing in there?
phyllis_vance You, are, a pervert!
dwight_schrute I am not.
michael_scott The Dundie award for "Longest Engagement" goes to Pam Beesley.
michael_scott Pam, everybody!
michael_scott Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.
roy_anderson Yes.
michael_scott Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?
roy_anderson Ah, w-we'll see you next year.
michael_scott Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
michael_scott I'm not changing that, it's the best one.
jim_halpert No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, "world's longest engagement", um, we're all expecting it, you know?
michael_scott That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
jim_halpert Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
michael_scott Oh, lazy. Uh huh.
dwight_schrute Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
pam_beesly You're taking away our bathroom?
dwight_schrute We are going to have two men's rooms.
phyllis_vance But where would we...go?
dwight_schrute Be prepared to hold folks From 9 am to...
pam_beesly Michael...
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly ...Dwight is banning us from our bathroom.
michael_scott Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
dwight_schrute Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
michael_scott Just don't, don't talk-
dwight_schrute ...for people's behavior.
michael_scott Don't talk-
dwight_schrute And it's-
michael_scott Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
michael_scott Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
dwight_schrute Best Dundies ever.
dwight_schrute Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
dwight_schrute Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. Devon!
michael_scott "The Dundies, how can I explain it? Awards you like to hate it. I'm psyched you all made it. You never had to work so hard and feel that no one notices you. You're just a name and number and no one even says hello." Card!
oscar_martinez The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party, and you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there. But the kid's having a really good time, so you're, kind of there. That's-that's kind of what it's like.
michael_scott "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"
dwight_schrute The waitress tripped on the cord.
michael_scott Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards. I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
kevin_malone Oh, just put these on the group tab.
michael_scott Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.
stanley_hudson You said, we could bring our families.
michael_scott I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
stanley_hudson I did, my wife's name is Terri.
michael_scott Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.
stanley_hudson It's this person who's hand I'm holding Michael.
michael_scott Shut it. Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
michael_scott No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
dwight_schrute Yeah?
michael_scott And I was about to take her bra off...
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
dwight_schrute Like an AIDS test?
michael_scott No! God.
michael_scott Alright, so let's get this party staaaarrrrted.
darryl_philbin Hey let's go to Poor Richard's.

michael_scott And now... to someone who quietly goes about their job, but always seems to land the biggest accounts...
michael_scott ...the "Busiest Beaver" award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
michael_scott Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
phyllis_vance This says "Bushiest Beaver".
michael_scott What? I told them busiest...idiots.
phyllis_vance It's, it's fine.
michael_scott Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.
pam_beesly ...because that's what happens every time!
roy_anderson ...talking about? He's a jackass every year.
pam_beesly No.
roy_anderson Come on, we're going to Poor Richard's.
pam_beesly No, I don't want to go, I don't want to.
roy_anderson Pam. Go.
pam_beesly If you would have asked me that, then you would know.
michael_scott Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
jim_halpert Hey! How are ya? I thought you left?
pam_beesly Oh no, I just, I decided to stay.
jim_halpert Oh!
pam_beesly I'll just get a ride home from Angela.
jim_halpert Oh.
pam_beesly Oh good, I'm just in time for Ping.
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
michael_scott Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.
pam_beesly Can I get a drink?
michael_scott This next award goes to somebody, who really, lights up the office.
michael_scott Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The "Hottest in the Office" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
michael_scott Yeah. "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go.
ryan_howard What am I going to do with the award? Nothing. I-I don't know what I'm going to do. That's the least of my...concerns right now.
michael_scott And the "Tight Ass" award goes to Angela. Not only because she is everybody's favorite stickler, but because she has, a great caboose. So...come on down.
angela_martin No.
jim_halpert I think those might be empty.
pam_beesly No, no. 'Cause the ice melts and then it's like second drink!
jim_halpert Second drink?
michael_scott The "Spicy Curry" award goes to our very own Kelly Kapoor! Get on up here. Here you go.
kelly_kapoor "Spicy Curry", what's that mean?
michael_scott Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, but why'd you give it to me?
michael_scott I don't know, it's just...
kelly_kapoor This is a bowler-
michael_scott I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
kelly_kapoor Yeah, but everyone else-
michael_scott Just sit down Kelly.
michael_scott It's so freakin' hot in there. Now I know what Bob Hope was going through when he performed in Saudi Arabia. Man! I got Dwight sucking the funny out of the room, but you do what you can do. Here we go, he's early with the cue. Here we go.
michael_scott "You have won a tiny Dundie."
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode01 at bar Sing it Elton.
michael_scott Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
Other#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode01 Guy at Bar We just came from yo' mama's house.

This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the "Don't Go in There After Me" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
michael_scott There you go.
pam_beesly Yay Kevin. Whoo hoo for Kevin! For stinking up the bathroom.
jim_halpert Yeah, alright Kev.

pam_beesly Fine work! Fine work Stanley!
michael_scott You know you did.
pam_beesly Here here! Speech, speech, speech, speech
stanley_hudson Well, well, last year, I got great work, so I don't...
stanley_hudson So, I don't know what to think about this award. But at least I didn't get smelliest bowel movement like Kevin.
michael_scott And this next award is going out to our own little Pam Beesley...
michael_scott ...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
michael_scott It is the "Whitest Sneakers" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
michael_scott Get on down here! Pam Beesley ladies and gentlemen! Oh, here we go.
pam_beesly I have so many people to thank for this award.
pam_beesly Okay, first off, my Keds. Because I couldn't have done it without them. Thank you. Let's give Michael a round of applause for MC-ing tonight because this is a lot harder than it looks. And also because of Dwight too.
pam_beesly Um, so, finally, I want to thank God. Because God gave me this Dundie.
pam_beesly And, I feel God in this Chili's tonight. WHOOOOOOOO!!!!
michael_scott Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman. Oh! Thank you.
jim_halpert What a great year for the Dundies.
jim_halpert We got to see Ping. And we learned of Michael's true feelings for Ryan. Which was touching. And, we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs. Which for me, has ruined them for life.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Nothing.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert I don't know, what?
jim_halpert Oh my God! You are so drunk!
jim_halpert Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
dwight_schrute Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
jim_halpert He's a volunteer.
dwight_schrute Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
jim_halpert Dwight come on, come-
dwight_schrute It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
pam_beesly Dwight, get off me!
Employee#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode01 I'm sorry, you're gonna have to put your clothes back on, people are trying to eat.
dwight_schrute Ahh! I can't-
michael_scott Was this year's Dundies a success? Well, let's see, I made Pam laugh so hard, that she fell out of her chair, and she almost broke her neck. So I killed, almost.
pam_beesly Oh my God!
jim_halpert Whoa.
pam_beesly I just want to say, that this was the best, Dundies, ever! WHOOOOOOOOO!!!
jim_halpert Whoa.
jim_halpert Whoa, careful, careful.
chillis_manager Employee We have a strict policy here not to over serve. Apparently, this young woman was sneaking drinks off other people's tables. I Xeroxed her driver's license and she is not welcome to this restaurant chain ever again.
michael_scott Great work tonight.
dwight_schrute Watch your step.
michael_scott Excellent.
dwight_schrute Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
michael_scott Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
pam_beesly I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
jim_halpert No you don't.
jim_halpert Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
pam_beesly Hey, um, can I ask you a question?
jim_halpert Shoot.
pam_beesly Um, I just wanted to say thanks.
jim_halpert Not really a question. Okay, let's get you home, you're drunk.
jim_halpert Alright.
pam_beesly Bye.
jim_halpert Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
