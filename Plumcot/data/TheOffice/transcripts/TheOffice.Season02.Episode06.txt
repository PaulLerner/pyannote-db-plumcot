dwight_schrute Where is my desk?
jim_halpert That is weird.
dwight_schrute This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.
jim_halpert Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
dwight_schrute I didn't lose my desk.
jim_halpert Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it?
dwight_schrute Okay, who moved my desk?
jim_halpert I think you should retrace your steps.
dwight_schrute Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
jim_halpert Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute.
jim_halpert Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
dwight_schrute Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
jim_halpert I know.
dwight_schrute It's by the ream?
jim_halpert Uh, yeah, ream.
dwight_schrute ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
jim_halpert Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
dwight_schrute Wash your hands, Kevin.
jim_halpert Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second...
dwight_schrute Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
jim_halpert Umm...
dwight_schrute Dwight...
jim_halpert You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
dwight_schrute Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
jim_halpert Was that your mom?
dwight_schrute No, that was my Sensei.
jim_halpert Oh, I thought it was your mom.
dwight_schrute I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
jim_halpert Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
dwight_schrute Assistant Sensei.
jim_halpert Ok.
dwight_schrute I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
stanley_hudson I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
pam_beesly I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
pam_beesly Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
michael_scott I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
ryan_howard Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
michael_scott Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
ryan_howard Why is that secret?
michael_scott Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
pam_beesly Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
michael_scott Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
pam_beesly It's just last year you...
michael_scott Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
pam_beesly Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
michael_scott Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
ryan_howard Updating emergency contacts.
pam_beesly Well, is that really a priority?
michael_scott Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
ryan_howard Catch-22.
michael_scott Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?
jim_halpert Uh, Larissa Halpert.
ryan_howard What's her address?
jim_halpert 117 Mount Bergin St.
ryan_howard Hello?
michael_scott Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
ryan_howard Do you mean Neverland?
michael_scott This is Tito.
ryan_howard What?
michael_scott Calling from...
pam_beesly You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
jim_halpert You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
pam_beesly I am just following the website.
jim_halpert Well, at least I don't have cavities.
pam_beesly Yes, you have very nice teeth.
jim_halpert Thanks.
ryan_howard Who is your emergency contact?
kevin_malone Stacy.
ryan_howard
michael_scott Pick up.
ryan_howard Hello?
michael_scott This is Mike Tyson.
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
dwight_schrute Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
jim_halpert No I'm not.
dwight_schrute Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
jim_halpert Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it.
dwight_schrute Ok, give that back to me.
jim_halpert Ok, say please.
dwight_schrute No. That is not a toy.
jim_halpert Please?
dwight_schrute Please?
jim_halpert Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
dwight_schrute Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
michael_scott And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
pam_beesly Could you practice on the forms?
dwight_schrute No women or children, unless provoked.
jim_halpert Ok, Roy?
dwight_schrute Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
jim_halpert Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
dwight_schrute Because we're friends.
michael_scott Because I would kick his ass.
jim_halpert Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...
michael_scott So? I've beaten up black belts.
jim_halpert Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
michael_scott They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.
ryan_howard Is your wife still your contact?
toby_flenderson Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
ryan_howard 'Kay.
toby_flenderson You don't need to write 'ex'.
michael_scott And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.
jim_halpert Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way, right?
michael_scott You were a Jet?
angela_martin Have you signed the expense reports yet?
michael_scott Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
dwight_schrute Argggg!
michael_scott I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
michael_scott Just hit me. You'll see.
jim_halpert I can't. I just got a manicure.
michael_scott Oh, queer... eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
jim_halpert Just have Dwight punch you.
michael_scott Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
jim_halpert You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
dwight_schrute What belt are they?
michael_scott Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
dwight_schrute No!
michael_scott ... he cried at the end of it. He did.
dwight_schrute Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
michael_scott Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
dwight_schrute Ok, I'll punch you.
michael_scott Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
dwight_schrute Kiyah!
michael_scott Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
dwight_schrute Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
jim_halpert Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
michael_scott Yeah. Thank you.
dwight_schrute I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
jim_halpert Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
pam_beesly I don't know.
jim_halpert Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
pam_beesly French Onion?
jim_halpert Obviously.
pam_beesly Ok.
jim_halpert Yes.
dwight_schrute Take this pen and stab me with it.
michael_scott Go away.
pam_beesly I just have a quick question.
michael_scott I haven't signed them, ok?
pam_beesly No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
michael_scott Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.
pam_beesly He's a purple belt. That's really high.
michael_scott Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
pam_beesly It's just out there, you...
michael_scott Oh, so that's what they are saying?
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
jim_halpert Uh, Kitchen.
michael_scott Ok.
kelly_kapoor Hi-yah!
dwight_schrute Good.
kelly_kapoor Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
dwight_schrute Now watch, let me take you from behind.
kelly_kapoor What?
michael_scott Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
dwight_schrute I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
michael_scott No, Really?
dwight_schrute In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
michael_scott Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
dwight_schrute Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
michael_scott Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches me punching you and you hitting the floor.
dwight_schrute No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
michael_scott Really?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
jim_halpert Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo?
michael_scott No, they must have class.
dwight_schrute No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
michael_scott Look...
dwight_schrute I've got the key.
toby_flenderson Michael...
michael_scott Hey, Toby.
toby_flenderson Any word on those time cards?
michael_scott I've got an idea why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
jim_halpert Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...
michael_scott I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
sensei_ira Uh, no, it's not.
michael_scott I think it is. A guy told me about that.
sensei_ira Actually, it's a symbol for eternal discipline.
michael_scott Oh.
jim_halpert Wow, that is really interesting.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
pam_beesly Well, look closer.
jim_halpert Oh, ok.
pam_beesly Once point for me.
jim_halpert Tied up.
pam_beesly Oh, you're dead.
jim_halpert What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
pam_beesly Hey, put me down. Put me down. Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...
sensei_ira Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?
dwight_schrute Yes, Sensei!
michael_scott Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
sensei_ira Shi mate!
dwight_schrute Hiii!
michael_scott Hey!
sensei_ira Alright, break.
michael_scott What the hell was that?
dwight_schrute Yes!
sensei_ira Dwight - awarded a point.
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute Eat it!
michael_scott Alright, that's the way you want it.
dwight_schrute Two more.
michael_scott Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
kevin_malone Sweep the leg.
michael_scott I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott I got his pants.
dwight_schrute It was my pants.
sensei_ira No points for pants.
michael_scott Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!
sensei_ira Clean single kick, gentlemen.
michael_scott Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
sensei_ira Ok, break. Break.
dwight_schrute No holding.
michael_scott You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. Eight points. Nine points.
dwight_schrute No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
michael_scott Open your mouth.
dwight_schrute No, Michael!
michael_scott You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? "Raging Bull." Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work... Oh, oh check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. Oh, we're playing phone tag.
Ryan's#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode06 Voicemail Seven new messages. First New Message. "Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein." Next new message. "Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend... and I'm mad!"
michael_scott My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
ryan_howard Fudge?
michael_scott Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
dwight_schrute I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
ryan_howard Ok, to what?
dwight_schrute Just put "The Hospital." Contact number just put 9-1-1.
michael_scott He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
kevin_malone Later Jim.
jim_halpert Later, Kev. Have a good weekend.
pam_beesly Yeah, you too.
michael_scott Yeah.
ryan_howard I have the emergency contacts.
michael_scott Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
ryan_howard Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
michael_scott If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
ryan_howard Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
michael_scott Alright, bye.
michael_scott Dwight?
angela_martin Michael, did you finish yet?
michael_scott This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
dwight_schrute I'm busy.
michael_scott Well, busier. Making the time.
stanley_hudson Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
toby_flenderson We want to go home.
michael_scott Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
pam_beesly The shipping place closes in a half hour.
michael_scott I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
angela_martin This is illegal.
stanley_hudson I don't care.
michael_scott I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
dwight_schrute Of course.
michael_scott And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
dwight_schrute Michael, I don't know...
michael_scott I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
dwight_schrute I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
michael_scott No, no, title change only.
dwight_schrute I'll have Pam send out a memo.
michael_scott No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
dwight_schrute Just a formality.
michael_scott Absolutely but not really.
dwight_schrute Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
michael_scott Yes you do.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Sensei.
michael_scott And, ditto.
michael_scott I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
