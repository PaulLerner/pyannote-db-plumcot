dwight I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
dwight For your convenience, I've broken it down into three
parts professional resume, athletic and special skills resume, and dwight Schrute trivia.
dwight I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
dwight How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
dwight There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
dwight I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
andy Big Turkey.
jim Is that you singing?
andy All four parts. Recorded it on my computer. It took me forever.
jim Nice job.
andy Thank you muchly.
jim You gonna answer it?
andy I called it myself. I just thought you'd get a kick out of the new ring.
jim Yikes.
andy Side note. I'd just like to say I'm thrilled to be working directly beneath you.
jim Thank you.
andy I feel I have a lot to learn from you, even though you're younger and have less experience. So here's to the future. andy and the Tuna. andy and the tuna.
jim I miss Dwight. Congratulations, universe. You win.
michael Yes, dwight Schrute has left this company. More personnel turnover.
andy The cost of doing business.
michael Yes, well. It is a big loss. dwight was the top salesman.
andy Was the top salesman.
michael I said 'was'.
andy Addition by subtraction.
michael What does that even mean? That is impossible.
andy Mmmm. Yeah you're right.
michael But, there is some good news. oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
oscar Hey, everyone.
kevin Oh, hello, Oscar. How was your gay-cation?
oscar Oh, that's very funny.
kevin Yeah? I thought of it like, two seconds after you left.
oscar Hi, Angela.
angela Oscar.
andy Hey, boss.
michael Hey, what's up.
andy Noooothin'. Ehrrrrrrrrr. Heh. Man. TGI-Wednesday. Am I right?
michael Yep.
andy Gonna go home. Get my beer on. Get my "Lost" on. What are you doing later, wanna hang out?
michael I don't know. Maybe.
andy Well, I will take that as a maybe. Where are you going?
michael Bathroom.
andy Oh, well, I'm going to the kitchen, I'll walk with you.
andy Yeah, things are going pretty good. Gettin' a lot of face time with the boss.
angela Oscar? I have a question. Would you like to join the party planning committee?
oscar The one of all women?
angela Yeah.
oscar Because I'm gay?
angela No. No. Certain events have transpired. And I've thought about certain things. And I'm sorry for the way those certain events transpired. And I would just like to make some changes about certain things and certain situations.
oscar OK, OK, OK, all right, all right. I'll join. I'd love to. That's -- thank you.
angela Thank you.
kevin Can I join too?
angela Never. Staples
guy You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.
dwight Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
michael Wow. What is wrong with this thing? It looks terrible.
pam Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?
michael Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
pam Oh, that wasn't the night crew. That was Dwight.
michael Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
andy Feel ya, dawg.
michael Yeah, do you?
andy Absolutely.
michael What did I say?
andy You said.
michael Huh.
andy Which is like, "Right on. " And pam was like "blah blah blah" and you were like "Yeah, psht. " Nailed it.
michael Oh, no.
andy Oh, no.
michael Love that Andy, right? Solid fellow. Seems smart enough. Likes me a lot. A lot. Too much. Like a crazy person. A little. Not super crazy. just. there's something about him that creeps me out. I can't really explain it. He's always up in my bidness. Which is ebonics for "being in my face and annoying the bejesus out of me. " I don't understand how someone could have so little self-awareness.
oscar I really have no preference. We don't even have to have a party.
michael No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
oscar michael --
michael No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis. I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
oscar Why don't you have me riding in on a donkey into the office like Pepe.
michael Ah, a burro, of course. If oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
dwight Need any help?
lady Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.
dwight Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
lady Okay.
andy I think I could go for some tuna fish right about now. Oh, oh, got my rod here. Whizzzzz. Click, click, click, click, click, click, click. Cli -- ah! I got one! I got one! Ahhhh!
jim Hey.
karen Hey.
jim So andy is in rare form today.
karen Yeah, you should not encourage him.
jim Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
karen Look, I've got like fifteen new clients I inherited from dwight and each file is password protected with a different mythical creature. So, I'm sorry. I can't.
jim Fine. Party pooper.
michael Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.
andy 185 pounder. Check it out. Whew!
jim Hey, Ryan?
ryan What?
jim You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
ryan Not right now, but ask me again ten years ago.
jim I liked you better when you were the temp.
ryan Yeah, me too.
michael Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?
phyllis Sort of. He had a lot of clients.
michael Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
stanley Oh, sure, we talk all the time.
michael Really?
stanley No.
michael Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and dwight were close.
phyllis No. Sorry. . push;
phyllis dwight has a big personality and I have a big personality. And a lot of times when two people like that get together it can be explosive.
paris Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.
dwight I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
paris So um, where were you workin' before this?
dwight Dunder-Mifflin.
paris What kind of company is that?
dwight Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
paris I never heard of 'em.
dwight Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
paris You gonna be like that, huh?
paris I don't like him, his giant head, or his beady little eyes. That's all I got to say on the matter.
andy In your he-ead, in your he-eyd-ed. Zombie. Zombie. Zombie. Ey, ey, ey, ey. In your he-eyd-ed.
jim Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
pam Oh, I'm kind of in the middle of -- yes please.
jim Okay, good. Stay right here.
andy Oh. Good move, Tuna. Nice one.
jim Are there any messages?
pam Nope.
jim So weird.
pam Hmm.
michael Nice to have oscar back.
angela Yeah.
andy Large Tuna. Have you seen my cell phone device?
jim No.
andy Cause someone is calling right now. There is a call.
pam Angela?
angela Oh.
pam Is everything okay?
angela No.
andy What's going on?
jim What are you talking about?
andy Where is my FREAKING phone?!
jim You know what? Maybe it's in the ceiling.
andy Maybe you're in the ceiling!
jim Okay.
andy I don't trust you, Phyllis!
angela I wanted to let you know that dwight was late that morning because he was driving to New York to drop off the correlated documents that I forgot to send. Though to be fair, kevin never reminded me.
michael Why would dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because dwight loves this company.
angela Yes.
michael Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
angela None of them. Especially not Andy.
michael Pam, I have a mission to accomplish. Make sure this party gets rolling and I will be back shortly.
andy Wait up. Where are you going? Do you want me to come with?
michael Um.
andy Just listen, I forgot to tell you the plan for this Saturday. You, me, bars, beers, buzzed. Wings. Shots. Drunk. Waitresses, hot. Football - Cornell/Hofstra. Slaughter. Then a quick nap at my place and we'll hit the tiz-own.
michael No. I don't want to do any of that.
andy Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.
michael No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
andy Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny! Oh, my GOD. That. was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?
pam Yeah.
andy Sure? Okay.
dwight Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
michael Hey.
dwight Hey.
michael What's up?
dwight Same old.
michael Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. angela from accounting told me what you did.
dwight Oh my God, she told you?
michael Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
dwight Accepted.
michael How's this place treating you?
dwight The boss isn't funny.
michael Oh, well.
dwight I don't get to wear my ties.
michael No. I'm sure.
dwight So?
michael So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
dwight I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
michael We can talk about that. All right.
jim Oh my God, that's half-inch drywall.
pam I think we broke his brain.
jim "It's not freakin' funny!"
angela Are you enjoying your fiesta?
oscar Actually, yeah. I didn't think I would, but turns out -- it's great.
michael Ladies and gentlemen! May I present. Mr. dwight Schrute!
everybody Yay.
angela Welcome back.
dwight Thank you.
michael Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. Not bad, huh?
dwight You did this for me?
michael Guilty.
creed Oh. Where did you get this stuff?
meredith Gerty's.
creed Which aisle?
meredith I don't remember.
creed Well, draw me a map, mama.
michael Pam. I will shake mine and then you will shake yours.
pam No, I will not.
michael So does this remind you of your childhood right now?
oscar It reminds me a lot of the 'Three Amigos' with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase.
michael Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
jim Hey.
karen Do you still have feelings for her?
jim Yes.
michael And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?
dwight Oh, man. No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out!
michael It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.
andy So michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.
marcy Oh, hi. You must be Andy.
andy Oh, hi! Yes. I am and you must be. Marcy!
marcy That's right, it's so good to meet you.
andy It's so good to meet you!
marcy Thanks. Well, you ready to have some fun?
andy Yeah.
