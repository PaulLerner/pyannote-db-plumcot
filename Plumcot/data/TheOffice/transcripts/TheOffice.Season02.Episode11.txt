jim_halpert Hey.
dwight_schrute Hello. Jim?
jim_halpert What's up, buddy?
dwight_schrute This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
jim_halpert Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
dwight_schrute Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
jim_halpert Who, Steve?
dwight_schrute Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
pam_beesly Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
pam_beesly Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
dwight_schrute Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
pam_beesly I love these.
dwight_schrute Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
jim_halpert Oh, there it is. J1.
dwight_schrute But I don't have any...
jim_halpert Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
dwight_schrute Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
michael_scott Hello, everyone.
dwight_schrute Good morning, Michael.
phyllis_vance Where are we going this afternoon?
michael_scott Ah! Ha ha ha!
pam_beesly Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.
jim_halpert "It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."
pam_beesly A ski mask and a swimsuit.
jim_halpert So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
pam_beesly And brush our teeth.
michael_scott Yeah?
stanley_hudson Michael.
michael_scott Stanley! Bo banley.
stanley_hudson I need to know...
michael_scott Banana fana fo fanley.
stanley_hudson What we're doing.
michael_scott Be my mo manley.
stanley_hudson You said bring a toothbrush.
michael_scott Stanley.
stanley_hudson Is this an overnight?
michael_scott Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
stanley_hudson Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
michael_scott Maybe, I don't know.
stanley_hudson Not maybe. Yes or no.
michael_scott Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
stanley_hudson In January?
michael_scott It's cheaper.
michael_scott This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
michael_scott It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
meredith_palmer All right!
ryan_howard I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
michael_scott No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
ryan_howard I'm already in business school.
michael_scott Well, this...
kelly_kapoor Wait, Michael?
michael_scott Yeah?
kelly_kapoor Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
michael_scott To throw you off the scent.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
michael_scott Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
kelly_kapoor I took the tags off already.
michael_scott Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
michael_scott I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
michael_scott Leader... ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership," as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!
oscar_martinez Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the Competition!" So guess where we went.
michael_scott Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
darryl_philbin How about the sales department is the sails?
michael_scott Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
phyllis_vance A furnace?
jim_halpert Yeesh, how old is this ship?
pam_beesly How about the anchor?
phyllis_vance What does the furnace do?
michael_scott All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
jim_halpert I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
michael_scott Titanic?
pam_beesly I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
michael_scott No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
jim_halpert Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
phyllis_vance Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
michael_scott No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
darryl_philbin What?
michael_scott The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
dwight_schrute Aye aye, Captain.
michael_scott A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
michael_scott Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
dwight_schrute Cool.
captain_jack Jack Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.
michael_scott I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
captain_jack Jack I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. Hi, welcome aboard.
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.
michael_scott Hey, look! I'm king of the world!
captain_jack Jack Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.
michael_scott And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
captain_jack Jack Okay! So...
michael_scott Okay! So...
captain_jack Jack Please. The life preservers.
michael_scott Right.
captain_jack Jack They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.
michael_scott But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
captain_jack Jack Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...
michael_scott I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
captain_jack Jack Okay, Michael, if you don't mind...
michael_scott Rock it!
captain_jack Jack Please, okay?
michael_scott If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!
captain_jack Jack Michael.
michael_scott Yep.
captain_jack Jack Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?
michael_scott We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
captain_jack Jack Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
michael_scott Hm? Okay. Yep.
katy You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
roy_anderson Yeah.
katy Pam, were you a cheerleader?
roy_anderson No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
katy That's hilarious.
jim_halpert It's not hilarious, but...
roy_anderson Where did you go to school?
katy Bishop O'Hara.
roy_anderson Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?
jim_halpert Um, no.
katy Yes, I did! A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
roy_anderson I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
michael_scott Having fun?
brenda Yeah. Everybody's really nice.
michael_scott Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
brenda When are you going to start the presentation?
michael_scott Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.
captain_jack Jack Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!
michael_scott So, okay.
dwight_schrute Limbo, whoo!
captain_jack Jack All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?
meredith_palmer Me.
captain_jack Jack Okay...
dwight_schrute Me! Me, me, me.
captain_jack Jack Uh... usually it's a woman.
dwight_schrute I'm stronger.
captain_jack Jack Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?
captain_jack Jack Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!
dwight_schrute I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
captain_jack Jack All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!
michael_scott But before that, I have to do my presentation.
captain_jack Jack Nope! Dance contest!
michael_scott All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
michael_scott Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
dwight_schrute What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
angela_martin Hey, come inside and talk to me.
dwight_schrute I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
darryl_philbin and Katy Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!
roy_anderson Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
pam_beesly No, I'm not going to do that.
roy_anderson Come on!
darryl_philbin That's what I'm talking about!
pam_beesly Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
roy_anderson I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! Darryl! Darryl!
pam_beesly It's getting kind of rowdy down there.
jim_halpert Yeah. Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
pam_beesly Sometimes I just don't get Roy.
jim_halpert Well...
pam_beesly I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?
jim_halpert Oh, um...
pam_beesly I'm cold.
captain_jack Jack So, what's this presentation all about?
michael_scott Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
captain_jack Jack Women and children.
michael_scott No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
captain_jack Jack That's a stupid analogy.
michael_scott Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.
captain_jack Jack Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
dwight_schrute Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
katy I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
pam_beesly Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.
captain_jack Jack Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?
jim_halpert Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king.
michael_scott Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
captain_jack Jack He's just sucking up!
roy_anderson When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?
captain_jack Jack Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.
jim_halpert You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
roy_anderson Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
michael_scott I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
roy_anderson No, it was Captain Jack.
michael_scott Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!
captain_jack Jack We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!
michael_scott Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
pam_beesly No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
michael_scott Then I'll give you away!
pam_beesly No, thank you.
katy Do you think that'll ever be us?
jim_halpert No.
katy What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
jim_halpert I don't know. Let's break up.
katy Whoa. What?
captain_jack Jack This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.
meredith_palmer Wow!
dwight_schrute Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
michael_scott Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
brenda Really? What?
michael_scott Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...
captain_jack Jack Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?
michael_scott It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.
michael_scott I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
michael_scott Is somebody there?
jim_halpert What happened to you?
michael_scott Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
jim_halpert Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
michael_scott He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
jim_halpert What a night.
michael_scott Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
jim_halpert She was always engaged.
michael_scott Roy said the first one didn't count.
jim_halpert That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...
michael_scott Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...
jim_halpert Yeah, I know.
michael_scott Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
jim_halpert Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
michael_scott Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.
jim_halpert She's engaged.
michael_scott BFD. Engaged ain't married.
jim_halpert Huh.
michael_scott Never, ever, ever give up.
dwight_schrute Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
michael_scott It's a fake wheel, dummy.
