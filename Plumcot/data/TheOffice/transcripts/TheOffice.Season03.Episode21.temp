jim It's kind of blurry. That's better. Question. What kind of bear is best?
dwight That's a ridiculous question.
jim False. Black bear.
dwight Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---
jim Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
dwight Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
jim Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of. eleven dollars.
dwight You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!
jim . MICHAEL!
dwight Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!
pam Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?
jim Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this.
phyllis I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
stanley I am upset. Don't I sound upset?
michael It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
michael We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing. unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan.
michael Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime.
dwight Cri-Man-Squa?
michael Crisis Management Squad.
ryan F and C, doubletime?
michael Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?
jim One more. Why are you talking like that?
michael To save time, Jim.
karen Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
pam Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
michael You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?
creed Here.
michael Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
creed Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
michael We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
oscar That's really not our job.
michael Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry, kelly will be training you first.
angela Kelly's training us?
kelly This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This day is bananas! B-A-N-A-
angela I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing.
michael Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids.
jim Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
michael No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person.
jim All right.
michael I want you to bring a partner.
ryan I'll go.
michael No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go.
andy William Dolittle at your service. A. K. A, Will Do.
jim Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
michael No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
dwight Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"
pam We're having a press conference?
michael No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
dwight Not!
michael Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O. J.
michael I have invited barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
jim Oh, did the press ask for a story?
michael Here is your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done. " Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go!
creed Yes, hello. creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect.
creed The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did. when I was a homeless man.
kelly Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
oscar I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
kelly I know, right? Probably a lot.
angela Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
kelly OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!" Except don't say "Kelly, " say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
kevin Oh! Can I be Australian, mate?
kelly Absolutely!
kevin 'ello, mate!
kelly I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend.
kevin I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies.
andy Beer me!
jim What's that?
andy Hand me that water. I always say "Beer me. " Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?
jim You know her name.
andy Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'?
jim It's fine.
andy Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
jim What about music? Do you have any music?
andy Uh, yeah. Should have said so. Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
jim I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or. a CD.
andy Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc.
jim Lord, beer me strength.
andy So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
jim Did that really need to be said?
andy Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
andy Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
jim Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
andy No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
jim Which one. is she?
andy The one in the green hoodie.
jim Wow.
andy I wonder if she's, like, a. a guidance counselor, or something?
jim No, I don't think so.
andy She's like, probably a tutor.
jim Nope.
andy She probably a t--
jim No.
andy Sh---
jim No.
michael OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
dwight On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair.
dwight First rule in road-side beet
sales Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow, I need this beet right now. " Those are the money beets.
dwight Hey! Look sharp! Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, dwight Schrute. Chad
lite Hi, uh---
dwight And you must be uh, from the Washington Post. Chad
lite Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life. "
dwight And "Breaking Corporate News. " Chad
lite And obits.
dwight Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance. Chad
lite Oh.
dwight Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage? Chad
lite Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---
dwight Great.
jim Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably.
andy Jamie!
jim Andy--- Ohh.
andy What are you doing here?
jamie Andy?
andy Are you a student here?
jamie Oh. yeah.
andy You never told me you were in high-school!
jamie This is weird. I. gotta go to Spanish.
andy OH MY GOD!
jim Oh my God.
andy I had no idea.
jim Well. that's not gonna hold up in court.
andy Huh. We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends. . push;
kevin Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am so sorry.
oscar Really, Dixon City? . Carbondale.
angela Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me.
kelly OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing sooo good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing?
creed When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
dwight Emergency dentist appointment.
creed Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this.
pam Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye.
barbara Hello, I'm looking for michael Scott.
michael Mrs. Allen is our most important client. because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.
michael And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
dwight You look good in this.
michael So, let us consider this matter ended.
barbara Well it isn't ended. I'm. I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.
michael I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.
barbara I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
michael Well, we are extremely sorry.
barbara I don't accept. School
official I'll be with you in a moment.
jim All right.
andy Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker.
jim Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.
andy But who was that guy?
jim Probably another high-school student. School
official The issue with the watermark is very serious.
jim Absolutely. School
official We teach our students that character counts.
jim And you should. School
official But---
andy Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch.
jim Andy. is having a real rough day today.
andy I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words---
jim "Good luck. "
andy That's not what I had in mind.
kelly Ask where he's from.
angela Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? He's upset about the watermark.
kelly OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
angela It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back.
kelly And you're sorry.
angela . and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. I think he had Tourette's or something!
michael We. are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
barbara Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.
michael The watermark. it's a one time thing.
barbara I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having s*x?
dwight May I point out that the s*x appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.
michael OK.
dwight I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having s*x in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
michael What. can I do, for you?
barbara I, for starters, I think that you should resign.
michael Well. OK, well. Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---
barbara You're the head---
michael The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
barbara You're the head of the company!
michael I'm the head of the company?!
barbara Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---
michael No, I'm a regional manager---
barbara And so you should lose your job!
michael No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!
barbara Fine.
michael That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
barbara Mm-hmm.
dwight It's non-transferable.
michael Doesn't matter. Out please!
barbara I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.
michael Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! Did you get all that? Chad
lite Everything.
michael We gotta do something. This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not.
pam It's just the Scranton Times.
michael No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then. YouTube gets a hold of it.
pam You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
michael You're right. It will blow over. But it's not. going to take. a week or two. Do you know what this is for?
pam Yes.
pam michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.
michael OK, I think that's good.
michael "Hello. I am michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that. "
dwight Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
michael That's how devoted I am to this job.
dwight I'm just saying.
michael I know.
dwight They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.
michael I understand that, Dwight.
dwight You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
michael Do you think you're taking it a little. literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?
dwight Cut.
michael So I'll know where---
pam Cut.
michael I'm asking pam to do it, please.
pam Cut.
michael OK, ready?
angela Kevin, what's four plus seven?
kevin Eleven.
angela Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
kevin Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial.
oscar Yes.
angela You two are apes.
oscar I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
angela I'm sorry. that you're both morons.
kevin Oh, but you still said "I'm sorry. "
angela I called you morons.
kevin Still said it.
oscar Still said it, so.
michael Five, four, three. "There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember. it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day. "
pam One day for what?
michael That's. they always give an ultimatum.
pam OK.
michael Good, cut?
pam Cut. That was your best apology video ever.
michael Thought so too.
creed Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children.
creed I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic.
jim You want music?
andy I don't care.
jim Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right.
andy Yeah.
jim A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh.

andy Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
jim A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh.
