dwight Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
michael My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
jim Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
michael Uh. try "password".
jim Nope.
dwight Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
jim No.
dwight Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
jim Okay, I'm not doing every number.
pam Wait, um, does anyone remember when it was set up?
michael Uh. it was like eight years ago?
pam Lord of the Ring stuff? I don't know, I'm just trying to think of things that were happening at the time.
erin Um, everyone was getting their driver's license.
jim Why don't we just call the I. T. guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
michael Okay, moving backwards, our I. T. Guys have been. Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
andy I got it, try, um--
michael You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but pam got really offended.
kevin Big Boobs.
meridith Drama Queen?
angela Nosy?
pam You're typing "Big Boobs"?
jim I'm trying everything.
dwight Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z".
jim That's-- the password. We're in.
dwight All Right
kevin Wow.
dwight Yes.
michael The important thing is. this kept us secure people.
michael Morning.
ryan How's It Going?
ryan Hey, I'm WUPHF.
michael I'm Facebook.
ryan What's up Facebook?
michael I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.
ryan You should've sent me a WUPHF.
michael A what?
ryan When you send a WUPHF, it goes to your home phone, Email, Facebook, Twitter and homescreen. All at the same time. Robotic
voice WUPHF. ryan and
michael WUPHF!
michael Dot com!
ryan Thanks Erin.
erin Sure.
erin Pam.
pam Mm-Hmm?
erin I don't wanna be a lousy snitch.
pam Okay.
erin ryan has been using the color printer for his business a lot, and as Office Administrator--
pam Oh, it's okay.
erin But it's not for--
pam Let it go.
pam Yes, I invested in WUPHF. It's actually a great idea and I can't believe it didn't exist before. And I know Ryan's kind of a sketchy guy, but hey, I married Jim. I've done my part for the nice guy. Now I want a bedroom set.
michael I think an investor's ski trip is the best idea. It will be a bonding experience.
ryan I love it.
michael I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
ryan Great, so we got our first offer to buy the company.
michael Your kidding?!
ryan We could sell, but why think so small? We can just get a couple more people involved, really do this thing our way.
michael You and me.
ryan New Investors are key, though. That's actually why I came in today.
michael Don't you work here full-time?
ryan Today, I was thinking I would sit down with a few of the people who haven't invested yet.
michael Mm-Hmm.
ryan Or we could do that together, if that sounds fun to you.
michael That does sound fun to me.
ryan Awesome.
dwight Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
dwight Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! Watch it, watch it.
dwight Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
guy Don't forget to make a broom.
dwight Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2
 00, and the Goat Roast is at 3
 00. Come on in, enjoy!
angela Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
dwight Roll in the hay, five dollars.
angela No, I meant.
dwight Oh, our contract.
angela Mm-Hmm.
dwight Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. Uh. I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
angela Perfect!
dwight So, uh. Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
jim All right, Thank you, I will--I will send the contracts over right away. All Right. Whoo!
jim I am on the first hot sale streak of my life. I think it all comes from feeding Cece, because no matter how much she resists, I sell her those carrots. Let's be honest--if I can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob. I can pretty much sell anything.
kevin Commission comes out to. dunh-duh-na-dah! Zero.
jim Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev.
kevin I entered the sale, and I hit enter, and I said, "dunh-duh-na-dah!" I'm pretty sure I timesed it right.
angela You met your commission cap last week. So from here until the end of the fiscal year, your commission will be zero.
jim What are you talking about? We--we have a commission cap?
angela It's a new corporate policy.
kevin Dunh-duh-na-dah!
gabe Is this job really about the money for you, Jim? I mean, isn't this where you fell in love?
jim A commission cap takes away my incentive to sell. So you realize I now have no reason to work, right?
gabe When you're dealing with a large organization, sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like. I wish my gym didn't allow full nudity in the locker room. Okay, seeing these old guys walking around naked feels almost passive-aggressive. But I deal with it. 'Cause it's policy. See what I mean?
jim Nope.
gabe Nudity makes me uncomfortable.
jim Okay.
gabe My gym allows it. I wish they didn't, but it's policy. So I respect it, and I just-- keep a low--you know, I look away. Think about your commission cap as a naked old man in a gym locker room.
michael Excuse me, everyone. s*x! Now that I have your attention.
stanley You don't have our attention.
michael MONEY!
stanley I'm listening.
kevin You had me at "s*x. "
michael Pervert.
phyllis You have all of our attention just by screaming anything.
michael That's good to know.
pam What do you want to say, Michael?
michael Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
ryan How's everybody doing?!
michael Whoo!
ryan Good! Now, a lot of you have already staked out your corner of the WUPHF empire. Raise your hand if I'm describing you.
stanley Yes, I have a dream. And It's not some M. L. K. Dream for Equality. I want to own a decommissioned Lighthouse. And I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there. And there's a button that I can press, and it'll launch that lighthouse into space.
ryan For my current investors, things are going great.
michael We already have a buyer.
pam Really?! Who?!
ryan Washington University. I don't even want to think about selling until our numbers get into the billions.
michael At least.
ryan So I've decided to open up a second round of investment to friends and family.
phyliss Oh, God. Hold on to your wallets, ladies.
oscar Did you ever think of WUPHF as an emergency notification system, like, for college campuses with shooters or gas leaks?
ryan No, no--Oscar, it's not--it's not a digital rape whistle. WUPHF is about fun.
michael That's right!
ryan Fun, communication, connection.
oscar What's your money situation?
ryan Well, it's tight, as with any start-up.
oscar Sure, how long can you sustain this without a cash infusion?
ryan We have nine solid days. I love these questions. Keep 'em coming.
andy I'm sorry, nine days until what?
oscar Bankruptcy?
michael Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
oscar How long do you think a week is?
michael No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
jim Well, since I have no incentive to sell, I've cleaned my car, organized my desk, and taken a multivitamin. So. what now?
jim Pam. Okay, now I've tried everything.
pam Did you prank Dwight?
jim No.
pam Well, you like that.
jim Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
pam I love you, but I'm kinda busy. So I need you to figure this one out on your own.
jim 
pam oscar said WUPHF only has enough money for nine days.
ryan Check this out.
erin All that color.
michael Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
andy Anyone can just throw numbes up on a chart. What are you doing to make it happen?
ryan Well, earlier today, I was emailing someone by the name of John Legend.
michael There you go.
andy You have his email?
ryan A lot of these guys are just Mac. com, @ their website, whatever. We get that guy WUPHFing, it's all over.
stanley I want my money back.
michael Do not talk like that, Stanley.
pam Ryan, just tell us your plan.
ryan Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
dwight Hey kids, was that fun?
kids Yeah!
dwight All Right!
kid I wanna go on it again.
dwight Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. . push;
dwight Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing. and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
angela 
angela Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
dwight Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
angela No, I--I think you should make time for it. Little
girl I found the needle in the haystack!
dwight Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is? Little
girl I don't know!
dwight Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
angela Dwight?
ryan WUPHF T-Shirts. Who wants one? Just imagine that you're at spring break, Daytona Beach.
michael Here we go.
ryan Everyone's like, "Hey Dude, whats up with all the hotties in the WUPHF shirts?" Or, Uh, "Hey, what's up with that helicopter? It's Ry from WUPHF!"
michael "It's ryan the WUPHF guy!"
ryan "Yo, Ry from WUPHF!"
michael "He's up there. "
ryan "What's he dropping?! Wow, what's falling on us, man?!" WUPHF condoms! 50, 000 condoms out of the sky!
michael Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
daryl Look, this is a marketing campgain. You got nine days. Let's say you do get the money. What are you going to do with it?
ryan The first lesson of Silicon Valley, actually, is that you only think about the user, the experience. You actually don't think about the money. Ever.
andy That sounds weird.
michael No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
kelly Are you guys meeting about WUPHF? You know that that was my idea, right?
kelly I said to Ryan, "I try to call you, and you don't have your phone. I try to I. M. You, and you're not online. I wish there was a way that I could do everything all at once, and I could just be like this little dog going, 'Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!'"
ryan Baby, Baby, Baby--
kelly I think I'm gonna stay here.
ryan No, no, no, no, no.
kelly I do, I do. This isn't right.
ryan I help you with your things and you help me with my things.
kelly But I--it's not right.
ryan I got this, it's okay. Don't worry about this.
daryl Is it any particular branch of Washington University?
ryan The Washington University Public Health Fund.
daryl W. U. P. H. F.
pam Oh, God!
daryl They only want it for the initials.
ryan The domain name. Yeah, they do.
pam I move we sell!
micheal What?
daryl Yeah, sell!
andy Yeah, sell.
pam Sell.
stanley Get us out of this!
ryan Have some faith in this idea!
daryl If everybody wants to sell, we sell, right?
michael I won't sell. And you know what? ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
ryan Yes. You alone do, actually.
michael I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
kevin Awesome!
man Do you mind if we share this bale?
angela Sure.
man There's no charge to sit on the hay, is there?
angela Probably.
man I mean, wouldn't you think the ten dollars to build your own broom would include the hay and not just the instructions?
angela Mm-Hmm.
man I mean, I'm starting to think this guy is just trying to make money off the holiday.
angela Yeah, instead of Hay Place, it should be pay place. Don't laugh at me.
man No, no, no, I wasn't--I was just laughing at your joke.
angela Oh.
man Pay Place.
angela Mm. Yeah, so we can celebrate Thanksgiving-Me-Your-Money Day.
man That's humorous.
angela Thank You.
kevin You guys know how to get out?
pam Hi, Michael.
michael Can't talk, saving the planet.
pam Oh, we don't recycle.
michael We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
pam I'm sure no one asked you to do that.
michael Eight Years.
pam Listen, I know you really like Ryan--
michael No, I won't even consider it.
pam Michael, I. I hate to say this, but. you know this special bond that you've always felt with Ryan, where, like, you're best friends or you're his mentor or something?
michael Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
pam Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.
michael I think you are wrong.
pam And there are a lot of other people in this office who have money at stake. Other people you care about.
michael You may be right. I may be crazy.
pam Don't.
michael I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
pam Yeah, but in a jokey way where you're gonna start singing.
michael I thought it might make me feel better.
pam Okay. Go Ahead.
michael But it just may be a lunatic. No.
jim Oh, nice, wasting time, here we go.
meridith Hey, back off. It's Solitare.
creed Hey, kid--hear you're looking for work.
jim Talk to me.
creed How far can you reach those Lovely long arms of yours? Eh, put 'em down. How long can you hold that pretty little breath of yours? Good.
gabe Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
creed We're working.
gabe Can you at least try to look busy?
jim 
jo "The moment Darla put the cupcake in her mouth, her daddy pulled her aside and said, "You're Too Fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. " The next time I saw David Geffen was at the buffalo club. "I love you, you Gay b*st*rd, " I said. "You Gay b*st*rd, " I s--. "Gay Ba--" "Gay B--""
ryan Michael, how's it going, bro?
michael Good, good, bro.
ryan Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
michael Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
ryan I have nothing but ideas. The thing is, they all require money.
michael Nine days, though. That's, like.
ryan Look, I know I've tapped you so hard.
michael Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
ryan Oh, you are funny, Michael. You--people, people don't give you enough credit.
michael Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
ryan Well, a lot of people are doing that. And there don't seem to be any consequences. And they say the rates have never been lower.
michael So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
ryan Think about this. You and me on a private plane flown by our private pilot--
michael Mm-Hmm.
ryan Eating our private meal cooked by our private chef.
michael Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so.
ryan We totally should.
michael Tonight?
ryan I gotta work on this.
michael Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
ryan Yeah.
dwight And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. Put your hands together for. Mixed Bread. And let's hear it for. Purebred. Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick. Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!
dwight Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
man So, if I were to call Dunder Mifflin and ask for Miss angela Martin, would I get through to you?
angela You would. And if I were to call your house and ask for your wife, would I get through to you?
man My wife passed away a few years ago.
angela How tragic. Very sorry to hear that.
man Thank You.
kevin Help! Hello?! Oh! Help!
daryl Consider it a WUPHF in person.
andy Your doing the wrong thing. You're gonna lose Michael's investment. You're gonna lose ours.
daryl You got this crazy opportunity to get our money back. Tell Mike To Sell.
andy If you tell michael to sell, he'll sell.
ryan I'm betting on myself.
stanley It's a bad bet.
michael Hello.
ryan Hey. It's an ambush here. Nobody here believes in this company. Will you tell them they're wrong?
daryl It's not that we don't believe in the company, We don't believe in you.
andy All those in favor of selling, say aye.
michael I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
daryl What is wrong with you? What happened to you in High School?
stanley Michael, are you that blind?
michael I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend. And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
andy You're gonna lose all of our money.
michael Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
ryan Oh. Uh, That's a lot of pressure. I--I'm gonna need some more time.
michael You can't have it.
ryan Okay. I won't let you down.
dwight Angela? Angela!
michael The world sends people your way. ryan came to me through a temp agency. andy was transferred here. No idea where creed came from. The point is you just have to play with the cards that you're dealt. Jim, that guy is an ace. dwight is my King up my sleeve. phyllis is my old maid. oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? ryan is probably, like, a two. But sometimes twos can be wild. So watch out. And I am obviously the joker. So. That's Uh. Robotic
voice WUPHF, from ryan Howard. Decided to sell company. Thanks, bro. Hell of a ride.
michael Thank God.
jim 
gabe gabe Lewis.
jo
 Now listen here, Gabe, you're too fat. No one's gonna like you if you're too fat. I made some changes to my book. See if you like them.
gabe Well, Jo--
jo Now, I love reading, and I hate being interrupted. Shut up and listen, you gay b*st*rd. Chapter One. I was born, not into luxary, nor poverty. But into adversity, and for that, I thank the Lord. My Father was a man. That's all we can know. After I learned to ride a bike, there was no stopping me. I would ride up Magnolia Stree and down Azalea Lane. Which would later become my--
jim All right, good night, Gabe. Just wanted to say thanks again. 'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
jo I've always been a fighter. And Fate has obliged me with plenty of battles, the first being a hard--
