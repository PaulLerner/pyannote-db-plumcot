karen So do you want to see it or not?
jim I don't know. Feel like. Friday night crowds.
karen Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.
jim Agoraphobic?
karen Yeah.
jim Really?
karen Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
jim Absolutely correct.
kevin Later, Jim.
jim Kev, have a good weekend.
karen Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up.
jim Here we go.
karen . and we're gonna go to dinner.
jim Ok.
karen And then we're gonna go to the movies.
jim Sounds good.
roy Hey Halpert!
jim Hey.
pam ROY!
karen 
pam roy don't!
roy Ahh God!
dwight Pam, please call security!
dwight Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?
michael No need for consternation, everything is under control.
jan Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
michael It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
jan Is toby there?
michael No.
toby I'm. here, Jan.
jan Ok, what. what is the situation Toby?
toby Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And jim won't press charges against roy or the company.
jan Thank God.
toby Yeah, um, but now apparently darryl has some issue with his.
michael No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this roy thing as leverage.
jan All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
michael Yeppers.
jan What did I tell you about "yeppers?"
michael I don't. remember.
jan I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?
michael Yeesh.
pam I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just. I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked.
jim I guess. all things considered, I was lucky dwight was there. And roy was lucky that dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
jim Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you. for stopping Roy. Thank you.
dwight Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
jim Okay. Um. Got you something.
dwight Don't want it.
jim You don't know what it is.
dwight Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
jim It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven.
dwight No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.
oscar Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up.
kevin Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
oscar It was crazy.
angela You saw it? Describe it please.
oscar Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. jim says something. roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
angela Oh.
oscar It was insane!
angela Well. good for Dwight.
michael Ok I want you to be darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
jim Where'd you get that?
michael Wikipedia.
michael Wikipedia. is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
michael Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
jim Hey, Mike. Since roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
michael Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think. that maybe you should.
jim I can't hear you.
michael What I'm saying is that,
jim Still nothin'.
michael Ok, see what I did?
jim No.
michael By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
jim Nice.
michael Ok, let's try another one. Um.
jim Okay.
michael Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
jim And what happens in this one?
michael It's a surprise.
jim Okay.
michael Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
jim Can I have a raise?
michael 
jim s*x, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
michael What?
jim What?
michael No, what did you say?
jim I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.
michael Oh it. sounded interesting. what you were gonna.
dwight I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
toby Which is where?
dwight Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.
toby Thanks Dwight.
kelly That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
ryan I can't imagine what I would have done.
kelly I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
ryan Well that was funny, that's why.
kelly Oh it was?
ryan Mm-hmm.
kelly Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night.
ryan Okay.
kelly . and you call me, to calm you down.
ryan You know what? I didn't---
toby Can you stop.
kelly . you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not.
toby There's a bunch of people back here, maybe.
ryan Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night.
toby Guys.
kelly I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
toby I don't think michael intended to punish me, by putting ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius.
michael Yeah.
darryl You ready for me?
michael Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.
darryl Cool.
michael You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room.
darryl Okay.
michael No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go. Yeah let's go to the conference room.
michael Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.
michael Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
michael I am declining to speak first.
darryl Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
michael Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
darryl Are you wearin' lady clothes?
michael What?
darryl Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady. pants.
michael No, this is a power suit.
darryl That there's a woman's suit.
michael I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.
darryl I'ma call Roy, man.
michael Ohh. kay.
darryl This is gonna make him feel better.
michael All right.
darryl This is too good.
michael Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
pam Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!
kevin You're wearing a woman's suit?
michael No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.
michael There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.
kevin Who makes it?
michael Uh, MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side. that's the mystery.
phyllis Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
michael Okay.
phyllis Did you see.
michael Would you stop it, please?
jim So, none of that tipped you off?
michael It's European, OK? It's a European cut.
pam Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
michael No, they don't. See?
pam 
michael Italians don't wear pockets.
pam It's been a really rough couple of days. This helps a little.
karen Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
michael No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
darryl Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
michael Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
darryl Okay, can you just stand right there? I gotta send some e-mails.
michael Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes.
kevin Karen, how do you feel that roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
karen I feel great, Kevin. Thank you.
stanley You must have been scared out of your mind.
karen Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
angela What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
karen Um, well, jim and I were talking and roy walked in looking super angry.
angela Mm-hmm.
karen And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, jim pushed me out of the way, and roy cocked his fist, and then bam, dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
angela Goodness.
karen When I heard jim and pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with jim about our feelings. roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one jim hated more.
michael Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
darryl Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
michael 
darryl What? I can't hear you.
michael That was a very good point.
darryl I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---
michael You make a very compelling argument. . push;
pam Sorry I almost got you killed.
jim Yeah, that was nuts.
pam He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?
jim No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
pam Not anymore. It's, um. It's completely over now.
jim We'll see. I'm sure you guys will. find you way back to one another someday.
pam Jim. I am really. sorry.
jim Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.
michael I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
darryl Why can't I just. tell you?
michael Because, that is the way these things are done. In. films. No, slide--- slide it, yes.
darryl There you go.
michael Oh. Come on. Be serious.
darryl I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want.
michael I. I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
darryl Come on, be for real Mike.
michael I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is. a pay stub.
darryl Are you serious? You're earning this?
michael Plus perks, yes.
darryl Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog.
michael Fourteen years.
darryl Ho-ho!
michael No, please, please.
darryl Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one. Ah.
michael Ok, let's take 15, again.
michael A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It. for example, every year I get a $100 gas card. Can't put a price tag on that.
jim Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
dwight When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
jim Boy I---
dwight No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
jim It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating.
karen Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
jim Well. yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do?
karen Hmm. I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
kevin Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
michael Oh, thank you.
kevin Yeah. I heard you might need it. So.
creed Here's the $40 you gave me.
michael I didn't give you $40.
creed In a way you did.
stanley Yeah, I heard how much michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid.
darryl Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later.
michael Okay. Okay, here's the straight. dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.
darryl What?
michael I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
darryl That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
michael Well what am I supposed to do?
darryl Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son.
michael I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.
darryl Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have.
michael That's true.
darryl Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
michael You know what? I should.
darryl Yeah, you should.
michael I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
darryl Fourteen years long.
michael You know what? I deserve a bump.
darryl Make it happen, cap'in.
michael I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
creed I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11
 30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car. Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
angela You're useless.
jan Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
michael No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.
jan Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
michael Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.
jan Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our. you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
michael Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
jan Da--- darryl from the warehouse?
michael Mm-hm.
jan No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
michael Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
jan Michael, he's your branch's HR rep.
michael No, toby is terrible. toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
jan . and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
michael Fine.
kelly You are so mean.
ryan I don't know what you're talking about.
kelly Yes you do, ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid.
ryan No, I said your idea was stupid.
michael Toby, come on. Let's go.
toby Where?
michael Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.
kelly What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
toby Alright.
kelly Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
ryan Don't you see why that's insane?
kelly Oh, so I'm crazy now?
darryl Comfortable, Mike?
michael Yeah. Fine.
darryl How about you, man. Comfortable?
toby No.
michael Don't ever touch a black man's radio! . Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way.
darryl Thank you.
michael Well.
darryl I haven't been to New York in a long time.
michael Mm, the Big Apple.
darryl Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there.
toby How would we get home?
darryl Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place.
michael Maybe I'll stay.
darryl Mm, it's not that big.
michael Well.
darryl Busses, though. They get you home quick.
michael Oh, I.
kelly And all of a sudden, dwight stood up and was like "No!"
angela Then what'd he do?
kelly You should just read the report that toby did. He took everyone's stories. Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12, 000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams.
hunter Hey guys, jan is ready for you.
darryl Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
michael Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
darryl Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me
michael All right.
darryl Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I. just can't help myself.
roy Hey man, uh. I'm sorry. Thanks. Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or. something?
pam I don't know.
roy Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you.
kevin Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
jim Thanks, Kev. I'm good though.
jan Thank you, Hunter. Hello. Come in. Ah, Okay.
michael Who's the boy toy?
jan That's my new assistant.
michael Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
jan I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
michael Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
toby Hi, Jan.
jan Hi, Toby. First--- First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear?
michael Pippity poppity.
jan Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
michael Six percent? After all we've been through?
jan Oh, God.
michael I got you. jade earrings.
jan Michael---
michael No!
jan Michael---
michael No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x. What are you writing, perv-ball?
toby Just preparing for the deposition.
toby This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold s*x from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
roy I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I. kept thinkin' about you two together, and. I just thought you guys were really good friends, or. or maybe he was gay or somethin'. Not that that's wrong.
pam I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
roy So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
pam Um. no. No, he has a girlfriend.
roy Oh yeah. Wait a minute, you. broke off our wedding for the guy.
pam No, there were a lot of reasons.
roy But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? I don't get you Pam.
pam I know.
dwight What's this?
jim What's what?
dwight Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. dwight K. Schrute"
jim Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice. honor.
dwight Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
jim Didn't think you'd notice.
michael Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!
jan Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere.
michael Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.
jan Ok, Toby, how about if you.
toby Sure.
jan Great.
jan What's wrong with you?
michael Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---
jan Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
michael Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
jan No, just. I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay?
michael Ah, so. All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise.
jan No. But we can offer you 12.
michael But you just said 15.
michael Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more. than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having s*x with Jan--
jan Michael!
stanley So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
phyllis Mm-hmm, near the river.
stanley Mm, how many bedrooms?
phyllis Four.
angela Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading.
dwight Really?
angela Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery.
dwight Mm, good stuff.
angela Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could. read it together.
dwight Sounds. fun.
jim I. will never say a word. And now, we are even.
andy I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it. So look out Dunder Mifflin! I mean, look out. in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you.
andy Hey guys! Guess who's back! AHHH! OH, GOD!
dwight No need to thank me.
dwight I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono.
