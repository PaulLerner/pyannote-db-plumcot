Harvey#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 Boobs.
kevin_malone Angela.
angela_martin What?
kevin_malone That was a voicemail that corporate left last night. They did not get our tax forms. Did you send them?
angela_martin They arrived this morning.
kevin_malone Are you sure? It is a big deal.
angela_martin Is it a big deal? Is it Kevin?
kevin_malone ... Do you really not know? Because it is a big deal.
andy_bernard Five of us transferred from Stamford. There are two of us left. Me and Karen. It's like we are touring Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and dropping off one by one. Well, guess what? I am not falling in a chocolate river.
angela_martin Everything ok?
dwight_schrute Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
angela_martin Thank you. I... I don't want those.
michael_scott Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.
andy_bernard Hey Dwight, pass the tardy sauce. Get it Michael?
michael_scott Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
andy_bernard Hmmm, well... let me think about this for a minute. Oh, I don't know. Michael Scott.
michael_scott Oh.
andy_bernard Ph. D. Doctor of Sales.
michael_scott Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
andy_bernard Well, it is very gracious of you to accept.
michael_scott Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
phyllis_vance We're the same age and I'll pick... Karen.
karen_filippelli Oh, uh, thanks.
michael_scott Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
stanley_hudson Pass.
michael_scott You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
stanley_hudson ... I'll take the kid.
ryan_howard I am very flattered. I was his second choice after "Pass."
michael_scott So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
dwight_schrute Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
jim_halpert Yup. I'll trade.
jim_halpert Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.
andy_bernard Sebring by Chrysler. Heck of a... motor... carriage.
michael_scott Dwight?
dwight_schrute Yup?
michael_scott Here ya go.
dwight_schrute Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
michael_scott Please.
andy_bernard He does your laundry?
michael_scott Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race." And you guys are the retired marines. And you guys are the mother and daughter. And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
karen_filippelli Wait, "Amazing Race" like, the biggest sale wins?
michael_scott No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
ryan_howard Is there a prize?
michael_scott Just bragging rights.
phyllis_vance Then how is this "Amazing Race"?
michael_scott It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
dwight_schrute Come on!!
phyllis_vance Michael.
michael_scott Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
andy_bernard Bueno.
phyllis_vance Do you have a pole?
karen_filippelli Let's go get a broom.
jim_halpert Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
dwight_schrute Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
michael_scott Here we go.
andy_bernard In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.
andy_bernard What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
michael_scott Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
andy_bernard Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.
angela_martin Hey Pam. Would you like to go with me to grab a coffee?
pam_beesly Really?
angela_martin Yeah, I could use some fresh air. Might be fun.
pam_beesly Ok. Sure.
angela_martin Ok.
karen_filippelli Why are we turning in here, this is a beauty salon?
phyllis_vance Um-hmmm.
ryan_howard Hey, do you mind if I take the lead on this one and then you can critique me after?
stanley_hudson You want the lead?
ryan_howard Yeah, if you don't mind.
stanley_hudson Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
dwight_schrute Leave the keys.
jim_halpert You still do that thing?
dwight_schrute Leave the keys!
andy_bernard I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
michael_scott Hawkman.
andy_bernard My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
michael_scott Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
jim_halpert After you sir.
dwight_schrute No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
jim_halpert Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
dwight_schrute Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with...
pam_beesly Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.
angela_martin This friend of mine - let's call her Noelle - she missed this deadline turning something in to Corporate in New York. But then this gallant gentleman - we'll call him Kurt - he drove all the way to New York and handed it in for her. That's... I don't know. I guess he really just likes her a lot.
pam_beesly That's great.
angela_martin Yes, it is. Hello?
michael_scott Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?
Buyer#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 Yep.
michael_scott You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
andy_bernard Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
michael_scott You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
andy_bernard Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York.
Buyer#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.
michael_scott I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
andy_bernard Oh, man, that is, like, poetry.
michael_scott No.
andy_bernard I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
michael_scott Stop it. Stop it.
andy_bernard Ow.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. This is Pam. I did?
andy_bernard Oh man. Talk about your classic "Lame dash O." Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
michael_scott Yes.
andy_bernard I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
michael_scott Ah, no. Don't worry about it.
andy_bernard I really 'Schruted' it.
michael_scott What?
andy_bernard 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
michael_scott I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
phyllis_vance It's a big order. Thanks Kenny.
karen_filippelli Yeah, thank you.
phyllis_vance Hey, how's Annie?
kenny Oh, she's great. This is us last year in Bermuda. Lovely place. You ever been to Bermuda?
julius Stanley Hudson.
stanley_hudson Ah, Julius, how's it goin'?
julius Great, great, great.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 Stanley.
stanley_hudson So good to see you too. I'd like you fellas to meet Ryan Howard.
ryan_howard Hi.
stanley_hudson I'm gonna let Ryan do a little pitch for you while I do my crossword. Ryan?
ryan_howard Um... Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.
julius Hello, Ryan. What do you have for us?
ryan_howard Oh...
jim_halpert We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 'Kay. 'Kay.
dwight_schrute Can I use your phone?
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 Yeah, sure, go ahead.
dwight_schrute Thanks.
jim_halpert Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
dwight_schrute One...
jim_halpert We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
dwight_schrute Three...
jim_halpert And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
dwight_schrute Seven...
jim_halpert We can custom make them.
pam_beesly Yeah I did a watercolor of Frances Willard Elementary School for a contest they were having. They were calling with the results. And I won. I won! My painting won. So I like to thank my mom for always encouraging me. And I like to thank my dad for buying me my first set of art pencils. And I'd like to thank the sixth grade class that picked me.
pam_beesly Hey Kev, guess what. I won an art contest today.
kevin_malone How much did you win?
pam_beesly $100.
kevin_malone I won $400 bucks on the Celtics game last night.
pam_beesly Cool. Congratulations.
kevin_malone Thanks, so sweet.
stanley_hudson Ha ha ha! And you just said, "Hi! Hi! Hi!" Ha heh ha! You sounded like my niece, and she's six months old!
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.
dwight_schrute Sure.
jim_halpert Sure, that's true we can't compete with their prices. But let me ask you something. How important to you is customer service?
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 It's very.
Phone#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.
dwight_schrute Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
jim_halpert And this is Dunder-Mifflin.
kelly_kapoor Dunder-Mifflin customer service, this is Kelly.
jim_halpert Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.
kelly_kapoor Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... .
dwight_schrute Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode12 All right, I get it. We got a deal.
jim_halpert Thanks.
pam_beesly Hey, Angela. I got good news today too. I won an art contest.
angela_martin That's great Pam. I like having these little moments with you. You know what? Sprinkles recently had kittens.
pam_beesly Oh.
angela_martin I would like to offer you the dominant male. His name is Ash.
pam_beesly Oh?
angela_martin Mmm-hmm.
pam_beesly Hmm. I don't think so. But thanks. My building manager... is... You understand.
angela_martin Well then. Have a nice day.
karen_filippelli Thanks. That was fun.
phyllis_vance Yeah, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are a very nice person.
karen_filippelli Thank you.
phyllis_vance I'm so glad you're with Jim. He was hung up on Pam for such a long time. Never thought he would get over her.
karen_filippelli That's nice.
phyllis_vance You can pay me back later for the makeover.
andy_bernard Hey boss. Got a minute?
michael_scott Yes, Andy.
andy_bernard I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
michael_scott He didn't say.
andy_bernard That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
michael_scott No, you are remembering it wrong.
michael_scott Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
dwight_schrute I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
jim_halpert Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
dwight_schrute My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
jim_halpert We should go on a double date.
dwight_schrute No thank you.
jan_levinson Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote "Beeswax. Not yours, Inc."
michael_scott I knew it.
andy_bernard Oh, doggie.
karen_filippelli Hey, do you want to grab a coffee?
jim_halpert Sure. Look at you!
karen_filippelli Yeah.
jim_halpert Beesley, coffee?
pam_beesly No, thanks. I had some already.
jim_halpert All right.
pam_beesly Oh, but, hey, Jim.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly I won an art contest today.
jim_halpert No way! All right Pam. Congratulations.
pam_beesly Thanks.
jim_halpert Which one was it?
pam_beesly I sent in one of my watercolors.
jim_halpert Cool.
pam_beesly It was the new one I did.
jim_halpert Oh
karen_filippelli You ready Jim?
jim_halpert Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Congratulations.
pam_beesly Thanks.
jim_halpert Big deal.
dwight_schrute Hey, we nailed the sale!
michael_scott Where were you this morning?
dwight_schrute I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
michael_scott Why do you lie, liar?
dwight_schrute I am not a liar.
michael_scott You are lying right now.
andy_bernard It sure seems like he is lying.
dwight_schrute Stay out of this, you!
michael_scott I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
dwight_schrute Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
michael_scott Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
dwight_schrute That's what she said.
michael_scott Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
dwight_schrute It's going to be ok.
angela_martin How is going to be ok, Dwight? Everyone will know our business.
dwight_schrute That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
angela_martin I hate those two people more than anything in the entire world.
dwight_schrute Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
karen_filippelli So, let me ask you a question.
jim_halpert Ok.
karen_filippelli Did you ever have a thing for Pam?
jim_halpert Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something?
karen_filippelli I moved here from Connecticut...
jim_halpert Yeah. Ok, here's the ... I had a crush on her before I left. And I told her about it and she didn't feel the same way. So, it didn't amount to anything, and I left. I'm really glad you're here. 'Kay?
karen_filippelli 'Kay.
dwight_schrute Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
andy_bernard Oompa-Loompa Doompity-Dawesome, Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome. Why was he gone, he was such a nice guy? No, he was not. He was a total douche. Doompity-doomp.
dwight_schrute I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
michael_scott Good luck.
ryan_howard Dwight will be missed. Not by me so much, but, he will be missed.
angela_martin Dwight, from sales, was one of the most honorable and efficient employees this company has ever had.
dwight_schrute One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
jim_halpert Hey man.
karen_filippelli What happened on your sales call?
andy_bernard Um, am I happy the way things turned out? Oh, well, happy's such an ugly word. But, um, I saw what needed to be done and I did it and now I'm thrilled. So, it's pretty... Hello? Pretty good.
