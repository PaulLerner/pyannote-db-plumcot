jim_halpert Hey. So, we saw a new billboard.
andy_bernard Yeah? Pretty cool, huh?
andy_bernard What better way to announce our new slightly lower prices than with an ad campaign? And what better face for an ad campaign than our new regional manager?
andy_bernard How'd it look?
jim_halpert You've seen it, right?
andy_bernard No.
pam_beesly Andy, somebody defaced it.
andy_bernard What? Morning, Stanley.
jim_halpert There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.
andy_bernard Erin, how long did we order those billboards for?
erin_hannon Six months.
andy_bernard Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.
meredith_palmer Great billboard! Funny, edgy, right up to the line without crossing it, loved it.
andy_bernard Which one did you see?
meredith_palmer Washington Street, the one with, like, twenty dongs on it.
jim_halpert Okay, don't be gross.
dwight_schrute What's going on?
pam_beesly Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
dwight_schrute Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
andy_bernard Yeah, Dwight.
dwight_schrute No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOO!
dwight_schrute Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
ryan_howard Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
dwight_schrute It's simpler this way.
oscar_martinez It's really not.
andy_bernard Now, stated arrival time is 3 p.m.
kelly_kapoor I don't get the reason for this party.
phyllis_vance Yeah, what's the reason?
kelly_kapoor What's the reason, Andy? What's the reason?
andy_bernard It's just a garden party. Sheesh.
andy_bernard You don't need a reason to throw a garden party anymore than you need a reason to throw a birthday party. It's a garden party. You don't need a reason.
andy_bernard Few other super simple reminders – no burping, no slurping, when eating take small bites and chew thoroughly with your mouth closed. Yes, Darryl?
darryl_philbin What happens when we're done chewing? Do we spit it out on the floor, or keep it in our mouths the rest of the time?
andy_bernard I get it, I'm being a little overbearing. But I promise to be underbearing for a week if you guys just all... step it up.
oscar_martinez Andy, we understand basic table manners, we're not children.
phyllis_vance Yeah, it's just a picnic.
andy_bernard This is not a picnic, Phyllis, it's a garden party.
darryl_philbin There's a grill in the warehouse I could bring.
andy_bernard Aw, ew, please don't. Not a barbecue. It's better than a barbecue. It's dignified, quieter, there are rules.
pam_beesly How is that better than a barbecue?
ryan_howard What's the dress code on this?
andy_bernard I'm glad you asked – Connecticut Casual.
stanley_hudson Any chance Connecticut Casual is Pennsylvania Business, i.e. this is what I'm wearing to your party.
andy_bernard Guys, my family just threw a garden party to celebrate my brother's promotion. It was a huge success. Check it out, there's a video online. Heartwarming impromptu father-son duet.
kevin_malone Yeah, Oscar, you showed me this.
darryl_philbin I've seen this, that's not you.
meredith_palmer Yeah, whoa, who's the sausage?
andy_bernard It's my dad and my brother. I would have joined in but this melody doesn't really support another harmony part, so... Check it out, that's my brother's boss. Look how psyched he is, he's having an awesome time.
jim_halpert Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
andy_bernard Yeah, of course. Ye... I mean, uh, yeah, I think he did.
phyllis_vance Why didn't you just say this was to impress Robert California?
gabe_lewis I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a party like this just to impress the CEO. Classic Gabe move. Hey Andy, how about you don't steal my business strategies, and I won't dress like my life is just one long brunch?
andy_bernard See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
dwight_schrute And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
jim_halpert So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view.
dwight_schrute They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
jim_halpert Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
dwight_schrute There's so much more to it than that.
dwight_schrute I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars.
jim_halpert I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. I've only sold one copy.
angela_martin Is there anything you wish you had done differently to avoid cankles?
pam_beesly Nope.
angela_martin I've already gone up another cup size. The senator is grossed out. When do you start feeling it kick?
pam_beesly Cece was around 22 weeks, but Phillip was much earlier.
angela_martin Phillip?
pam_beesly Oh, oh my gosh. Yes, but don't, don't say anything, okay? It's after my grandfather.
angela_martin Phillip is the name that we're using. It's after my favorite cat.
pam_beesly Oh, wow. Funny. It's after my grandfather.
angela_martin It's after my cat.
robert_california Andrew, I've picked up two possible gifts to bring this afternoon. One, a pot of marmalade.
andy_bernard Ooh, that sounds great.
robert_california Well, that, that is what you want then, the marmalade.
andy_bernard Sure.
robert_california You don't want to hear the other one. You love marmalade.
andy_bernard Uh, I'll hear the other one.
robert_california It's a basil plant.
andy_bernard You know, the marmalade sounds great.
robert_california I also mentioned the marmalade to my sister and she's very interested.
andy_bernard Then the basil will be fine.
robert_california Well, you clearly want the marmalade. Gretchen, I need another marmalade. Alright.
toby_flenderson Hey, where do I park?
mose I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.
toby_flenderson Uh, you know what, I can go park it myself.
mose I'm the... I'm the valet. You have to give me your car.
toby_flenderson It's probably okay...
mose Give me your car.
toby_flenderson I think it's better that I...
mose Give me your car.
toby_flenderson It's a finicky car...
mose Get out. Have a good time at the thing.
toby_flenderson It's a little tricky, you might have to... take...
dwight_schrute MR. RYAN HOWARD!
jim_halpert Chapter 2 – Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
dwight_schrute STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
andy_bernard How's it going over here, guys?
oscar_martinez Andy, stop hovering, you're being really annoying.
andy_bernard Didn't mean to bother you, Mabel. Mabel, Mabel, if you're able, keep your elbows off the table.
oscar_martinez Wow.
dwight_schrute MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
walter_bernard_jr So, you all work with Andy.
andy_bernard Well, technically FOR Andy.
oscar_martinez Technically FOR Robert California. He's our CEO.
ellen_bernard I thought you were the CEO.
andy_bernard I don't know how you got there.
walter_bernard_jr You said you were running the company.
andy_bernard This branch, I'm the regional manager.
walter_bernard_jr Yes, that makes more sense. Are you all regional managers?
andy_bernard Did I throw this party to impress my parents? That's crazy. Now, if they wanted a garden party, they could throw one themselves, which, as a matter of fact, they did, last week. They threw one for my baby brother who is totally amazing, but I couldn't care less.
andy_bernard Can I introduce you around now?
walter_bernard_jr Uh, yeah, we don't have too long, we have theater tickets.
andy_bernard What are you going to see?
walter_bernard_jr Money Ball. Walter Jr.'s choice.
andy_bernard What??
walter_bernard_jr Jr Hey Bronard!
andy_bernard I didn't know you were going to be here.
walter_bernard_jr Jr I wouldn't have missed it.
erin_hannon Ahh!
walter_bernard_jr Jr I'm Walter, Andy's younger brother.
jim_halpert Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.
walter_bernard_jr Jr Tuna, right? And this must be your lovely wife Pam .
jim_halpert No.
meredith_palmer Hell no. She wishes.
jim_halpert No, no, no, no, no. No.
walter_bernard_sr Sir, I need to be able to feed all the guests.
kevin_malone I understand.
dwight_schrute Set that down. Present yourself.
jim_halpert Chapter 4 – One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
dwight_schrute LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
robert_california Hello Andy.
andy_bernard Welcome.
robert_california Thank you.
andy_bernard Hey, I want you to meet my first bosses, Mom and Dad.
robert_california Yes, hello, nice to meet you.
walter_bernard_jr Pleasure.
robert_california Andy, where shall I put your basil plant?
andy_bernard Oh, I thought you were going to bring marmalade.
robert_california No, I'm certain you said basil.
ryan_howard This is not funny, man, let me down.
kevin_malone I think this thing is broken.
ryan_howard It's not broken, Kevin. This is how it works.
andy_bernard So pretty today.
ellen_bernard It's getting chilly.
walter_bernard_jr We really should be leaving.
andy_bernard Yeah, um, it would be weird if the boss man didn't make a toast, so, hang on. Everybody, I just want to take this opportunity to thank you all for coming, and to raise a glass to my amazing staff.
andy_bernard Toasts are great. I mean, you toast somebody, they toast you back. It just goes round and round. That's my favorite part about toasts, the reciprocity.
andy_bernard Let's hear from you guys, who do you want to toast?
darryl_philbin Yeah, I'll say something. I think we should be acknowledging our boss, because none of us would be here without him. Robert California!
gabe_lewis I can't believe I didn't think of toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel! Why are you talking to Stanley's mistress?
angela_martin I would like to toast someone who isn't here but who will be in just four short months. Welcome to the world, Phillip Lipton!
pam_beesly I also would like to toast Phillip Halpert, who is due even sooner. May he be a good namesake to my grandfather who I promised as a child long before tonight that I would one day name my son after him. To Phillip Halpert!
angela_martin She just always has to copy anything I do! It's the Ford Taurus situation all over again!
ryan_howard I'd like to make a toast to the troops. All the troops. Both sides.
erin_hannon I think we should toast...
dwight_schrute Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
jim_halpert Chapter 9 – The tableau vivant is not only welcomed, but expected entertainment at any garden party.
kevin_malone Andy? I think we should acknowledge the man who has led us to such a profitable quarter. To Robert California.
gabe_lewis I would also like to toast Robert California. Mr. California,...
andy_bernard You can't triple toast somebody! At least not until we get everyone once.
robert_california I'll say a few words if that's alright with you, Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah, yeah.
robert_california You people say I led you, but it wasn't me. You want to toast the man who led you to success, but the boss is irrelevant. Andy and I, we produce nothing. We do nothing. We sit in our offices and demand, I want this and that right now, like petulant children. You know, the difference between a crying baby and a manager, one day the baby will grow up. But, without you, Andy and I would be sitting in our dirty diapers, waiting for someone to change us, wipe us. I should be toasting you, thanking you, for allowing me to have the easiest job in the universe. Cheers.
gabe_lewis To Robert California, from the moment you entered our building and our hearts, you...
andy_bernard Some of you know that we have an internet star in our midst. Mr. Walter Baynes Bernard Sr., please report to the stage!
walter_bernard_jr I'm eating, Andy.
andy_bernard Ah, come on!
walter_bernard_jr Okay. Okay.
andy_bernard Yes!
walter_bernard_jr What do you want to do?
andy_bernard Well, how about one of our classic father/son duets?
walter_bernard_jr Oh, whoa, sure? Really? It's a little tricky.
andy_bernard Saying I love you is not the words...
walter_bernard_jr It's too high.
andy_bernard Yeah?
walter_bernard_jr It's high but it's not that high.
andy_bernard Right, it feels strange.
walter_bernard_jr Just take it down a little.
andy_bernard Saying I love... Saying I love you...
walter_bernard_jr Here, give it to me. Okay. Uh, something like... Saying I love you is...
andy_bernard & Walter ...not the words...
walter_bernard_jr You don't come in yet. ...I want to hear from you, It's not that I want you...
andy_bernard & Walter ...not to say it but if you only knew... More than words is all you have to do to make it real...
andy_bernard Is anyone filming this? Seriously! Erin!
erin_hannon It's either taping or calling.
andy_bernard & Walter What would you do if my heart was torn in two...
walter_bernard_jr You know what, Walter Jr. is here. Why don't you come up and join us?
walter_bernard_jr Jr Dad, no. I'm just having a good time getting to know Andy's friends here.
meredith_palmer Get up there and sing or I will cut your larynx and you'll never be able to sing again. Woo!
walter_bernard_jr & Walter Jr May the good lord be with you down every road you roam. And may sunshine and happiness surround you when you're far from home. And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true. And do unto others as you'd have done to you...
andy_bernard Cheers! Alright! Cheers, cheers, cheers, get your own guitar.
Erin'sCell#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode04 Phone If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
erin_hannon Sorry.
kelly_kapoor I am so cold.
ryan_howard That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
dwight_schrute My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
robert_california Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
dwight_schrute Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
robert_california Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?
dwight_schrute I can get you exotic meats – hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
robert_california We'll talk.
dwight_schrute It'll all be goat.
andy_bernard Hello, Cece Halpert? This is Andrew Bernard. I'd very much like to speak with you about your paper supply needs. That wasn't even my worst sales call.
walter_bernard_jr Hi. What was that display?
andy_bernard I don't know, I just thought if I could throw this great garden party and show you how respected I am that you'd be proud of me.
walter_bernard_jr Andrew...
andy_bernard I know, I know that you're proud of me.
walter_bernard_jr I'm not going to tell you how impressed I am that you're a manager of some rinky dink branch of a paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. How long are you going to go on needing my approval? You're a grown man, don't act like a little boy who needs...
darryl_philbin I think if I had parents like that I'd be trying to convince everyone all the time how great I was, too.
oscar_martinez Guess we found Andy's rosebud.
darryl_philbin Rosebud?
oscar_martinez It's a reference to Citizen Kane. Something that explains why a person became the way they are.
darryl_philbin I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't explain why he was how he was, it just represented what was important to him as a child, that he missed.
oscar_martinez Different school of thought. Let's just agree to disagree.
darryl_philbin No. You're wrong.
robert_california Are you sure?
ryan_howard Yeah! I'm too hot anyway.
robert_california My body has somehow become acclimated to southern Italy. Isn't that strange? I've never been there! Oh, ah, yes, that's nice. Thank you.
walter_bernard_jr It was a nice party, the setting was a little strange. Uh, the food...
ellen_bernard Sandwiches were dry.
walter_bernard_jr Jr Bye Tuna, bye Pam!
andy_bernard Hey everybody, I'm gonna leave and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.
darryl_philbin Cheeseburger or hamburger.
andy_bernard Um, cheeseburger.
oscar_martinez Narddog.
andy_bernard Thanks, Oscar.
pam_beesly What are they doing?
jim_halpert Closing ceremonies.
pam_beesly Nice touch.
jim_halpert I think I left my wallet in your house.
dwight_schrute Who cares.
jim_halpert Right here.
dwight_schrute MR. JAMES HALPERT!
jim_halpert Keys, keys...
dwight_schrute Stop forgetting things.
jim_halpert I didn't forget them, they're right here.
dwight_schrute MR. JAMES HALPERT!
jim_halpert I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
dwight_schrute What? Idiot.
jim_halpert Whoo.
dwight_schrute MIS... MI... What are you doing?
jim_halpert Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
dwight_schrute That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
