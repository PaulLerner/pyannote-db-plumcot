pam I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.
kelly I heard your momma had more bacteria per square inch than a toilet seat.
michael That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
jim Stop.
michael Um. kay. Uh, alright.
pam One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.
erin Di-Did you say vampire?
pam Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this.
dwight Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? 'Cause of the euro.
pam Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.
dwight Uh.
pam And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.
dwight NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
jim Elaborate.
dwight The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter.
pam I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.
dwight Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
jim So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
dwight Yes. I would welcome it.
jim You're welcome.
dwight The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
angela Jim. Pam. And the precious bundle of God's gift to everything. I wish you both a pleasant day. And you too. Yes. Praise God. Ok.
pam Cece's getting christened today.
jim Big day.

ryan Hope you brought your pipes. We're about to smoke the opium of the masses.
michael Oh, yes. Doobie-doobie doo.
michael I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just jim or pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate. my joy. And our, all of ours joys.
andy Ah, man.
andy Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. all jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.
dwight For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
toby Sunday church service. it's been a few years. The Big guy and I, we got some catching up to do.
michael Hey. Hey. I got an offer that you can't refuse. Scooch over.
pam Oh, Michael, this is just for family.
michael But I'm the Godfather.
jim It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
michael Are you talking to me?
jim Ok, your turn.
michael Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
pam Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.
michael Yeah.
pam I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.
michael I'm not the godfather.
pam Okay, thank you.
michael So who is the godfather?
pam Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.
michael Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
pam No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.
michael No, I have plenty of friends, so. all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
pam Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.
michael I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out. Church
congregation We ask you, Lord, come to our aid.
pastor Good morning.
all Good morning.
michael Good morning.
pastor What a terrific day this is, and not just because the Eagles are playing.
pastor You may have seen the bus out front. Today we also say good-bye to our young adult ministry. They're leaving for three months to build a school for the village of Quimixto, in Cabo Corrientes, Mexico.
ryan I've heard of that place. If you go to Cabo San Lucas, all the prostitutes are from Cabo Corrientes.
toby Okay, this is, all right, this is silly. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Female church
member And thank you for your prayers for Justin. We hope for a speedy recovery.
pastor Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance?
dwight Good morning. dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
pastor Christening calls to repentance, to faithfulness, and to discipleship. We've come to celebrate these babies.

jim No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
pam You said you checked it.
jim I did. say that.
pastor At this time, will the families please come join me?
michael jim and pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.
pastor Before we go, I'd like to remind everyone that the "Halberts" have been kind enough to host a reception next door immediately following the service.
jim Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
jim Okay, "A, " Halbert. And, "B, " I think a more appropriate statement would be, "The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests. "
ryan For all their generosity of spirit, they password-protect their wireless?
kelly Try "Jesus. "

angela You don't know them all?
pam Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.
angela Jesus is not your caterer. But he should be your caterer 'cause you're a little angel. Why didn't your parents get you a caterer? They don't think.
pam Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.
jim Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
pam I don't know. I'm just hungry.

girl Excuse me, everyone, on behalf of the youth ministry that's leaving for Mexico, I just wanted to thank our hosts and tell you about those good-looking guys and gals over there.
ryan Teach for America girls are way hotter, but they're nuts.
girl This is Jessica Ortega. I met her when both she and I were both seven years old when my parents took me to Quimixto on a service trip.
phyllis Who takes a kid to Mexico?
stanley I would run to Mexico if that's where the sandwiches are.
michael Shh.
girl Right now, Jessica's children have to walk twelve miles to a school with dirt floors.

girl It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos. . push;
dwight Greg, hello, it's dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
michael Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
dwight I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
michael Are you kidding me? Stop it.
dwight I'll call you back.
girl My parents explained it to me this way. You wouldn't hesitate to save a family member from a burning building, but what if the earth was your building and all the people on it were your family?
andy What if the moon was your car and Jupiter was your hair brush?
michael Shh.
girl Thank you. Or should I say gracias?
pam Cece went down.
woman What was this? You're out of it.
jim Scones.
woman I didn't get one.
pam Well, if it makes you feel better, I didn't get one either.
woman Is it just the one jug of apple cider?
pam Who the heck was that?
jim I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
pam We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.
jim all right. And cider.
michael Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.
stanley You could feed the hungry. Us.
oscar Why do we have to do something together? I volunteer at a clinic on my own time.
michael Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
darryl We are hanging out-right now. You want some more of this?
michael Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
phyllis Church isn't a party, Michael.
michael Well, it's, it's-
ryan Welcome to the party. Everybody have their kool-aid?
michael No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
jim Oh, hey, Mee-Maw, would you watch Cece for a second? Don't worry. She's asleep. I'm just gonna track down some more chairs. Mee-
maw Fine, fine. I guess I'll watch Suzanne's purse and your baby.

darryl I agree. I think it's superb.
gabe Well, you have a job to do. Okay, there is no off-season when it comes to printer sales.
michael You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
andy Michael, you can't go to Mexico. You don't have your passport.
guy You don't need one to get in. Plus, we can just have it sent to him down in Mexico.
michael Hey, right?
phyllis Michael, what am I supposed to tell my clients if they ask about you?
michael Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
phyllis Okay, but what about the bigger corporate accounts?
michael Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
dwight Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
michael No, you may not.
dwight Gah!
erin I think it's really cool, Michael. I wish I had a job that I could just leave.
michael Thank you.
andy Save me an aisle seat, Michael! I'm coming!
andy I will not stand idly by while these Mexican villagers are sick.

michael See you in a few months.
girl If the whole world were like you guys, we wouldn't have so many problems.
michael Mm. That's not gonna happen.
andy We're one in a million.
girl I know. Nobody I know would leave their jobs and friends and families to do manual labor for three months.
michael Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So.
andy Just a heads up. Probably gonna be borrowing a few things. Uh, gonna need a contact lens case, some sunscreen, some sandals.
toby Why you always got to be so mean to me?
jim Uh, MeeMaw, where's Cece?
Meemaw I don't know. I lost the purse too.
jim Okay.
andy Good-bye, Lackawana County.
michael How long till we get to Mexico?
andy Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.
michael Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
andy I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or.
michael Why aren't they building it themselves?
andy They don't know how.
michael Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
andy Well, carla knows.
michael carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
carla Oh, trying to sleep.
michael What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?

michael Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
andy And the Christmas party.
michael And Cinco de Mayo.
andy Nah, no. We'll be back before that.
michael No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
