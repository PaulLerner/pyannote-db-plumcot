dwight_schrute What is this?
jim_halpert Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
dwight_schrute You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours?
jim_halpert Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
dwight_schrute Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
jim_halpert I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
dwight_schrute Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my --
stanley_hudson Eh...
phyllis_vance I'm sorry. It's the largest one I have.
stanley_hudson I will not be the big guy in the tiny hat.
phyllis_vance This is the first Christmas party I am throwing as head of the party planning committee. The theme is "Nights in Morocco". This isn't your grandmothers Christmas party. Unless of course she's from Morocco, in which case it's very accurate.
michael_scott Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?
phyllis_vance Yes.
michael_scott Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
phyllis_vance Angela. You're going to move this for the party right? It's not on theme.
angela_martin It's the nativity scene.
phyllis_vance Alright. You can keep your camel, sheep, elephant and the north African king can stay. Everything else goes in the drawer.
angela_martin I am not going to judge Phyllis for desecrating Christmas. There is one person who will though and Phyllis just stuffed him into a drawer.
phyllis_vance I need you to get rid of the tree.
angela_martin But--
phyllis_vance Thank you.
phyllis_vance Oh, I don't think it's blackmail. Angela just does what I ask her to do so I won't tell everyone that she's cheating on Andy with Dwight. I think for it to be black mail, it would have to be a formal letter.
jim_halpert Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
dwight_schrute These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil.
dwight_schrute Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. Catchphrase "My horn can pierce the sky". Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks. And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit. Isn't that right princess?
jim_halpert That's the Christmas spirit.
dwight_schrute I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has s*x with a unicorn? Man with a horn has s*x with a royal horse?
jim_halpert Yes.
michael_scott Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.
dwight_schrute They are now.
michael_scott Cool. My horn can pierce the sky.
michael_scott This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.
meredith_palmer Oh... my... GOD!!! Hit me again.
michael_scott Alright... One more time around the block.
jim_halpert I will grant you one wish.
pam_beesly I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.
jim_halpert Stupid. Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. Dumb.
andy_bernard Hey, hey... Ange... check it out. There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance.
angela_martin Really Andy? It's Christmas and your singing about nudity and France.
andy_bernard There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.
michael_scott Jim, Jim....
jim_halpert What is it?
michael_scott That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
jim_halpert Wow, that is delicious.
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert Can't believe no ones thought of that.
michael_scott I know.
meredith_palmer Ahh yeah!!
meredith_palmer Belly dancing!
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode10 buying doll 120, 180... 200.
dwight_schrute All right.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode10 Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.
dwight_schrute Oh, so glad I could help.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode10 Thanks.
dwight_schrute Merry Christmas.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode10 You too.
dwight_schrute Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
michael_scott Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.
jim_halpert Oh, oh, oh, oh!
dwight_schrute We got a live one! On fire!!
meredith_palmer I'm all right. I'm all right.
andy_bernard Sorry.
oscar_martinez We're back on the 5th, should we just do it then?
michael_scott Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
oscar_martinez What about February 2nd?
jim_halpert Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
michael_scott No, no. I celebrate privately.
jim_halpert That's cool.
michael_scott Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
oscar_martinez Now? It's our Christmas party.
michael_scott We'll do it quickly.
jim_halpert Well what if we can't do it quickly.
michael_scott What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
oscar_martinez Do you know how to do an intervention?
michael_scott Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
michael_scott An intervention. It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions. And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves. And then they stop.
phyllis_vance It looks like we're going to be here for awhile, so why don't you make a little plate of hummus for everyone. Little triangles of pita, toasted on both sides, fanned so you can easily can grab them.
angela_martin I don't--
phyllis_vance And napkins... fanned.
michael_scott Okay, how do you feel?
meredith_palmer A little better. I threw up.
michael_scott Uck... T.M.I.
kevin_malone Fire girl. Too soon?
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
toby_flenderson Michael, we are only allowed to talk about Meredith's work performance. We can not ask her to stop drinking.
michael_scott I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
meredith_palmer I'm not an alcoholic.
michael_scott Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
dwight_schrute Aye.
michael_scott The aye's have it.
meredith_palmer I don't care what everyone thinks. I know I am not an alcoholic.
michael_scott Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we?
andy_bernard When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke. I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class. Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses. They called me Ace. It was totally awesome. Got straight B's. They called me Buzz.
michael_scott Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?
meredith_palmer Sure.
michael_scott Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
meredith_palmer Obviously.
michael_scott Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
oscar_martinez Where did you get this?
michael_scott I got it on a website, that's not important.
toby_flenderson Michael, We should contact some experts. You don't know what your doing.
michael_scott Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?
kelly_kapoor Yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag.
michael_scott Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better. Yes, Kevin.
kevin_malone Well, Meredith, there was that one time you bought movie tickets and then you got too drunk to go, so you gave them to me. And that was really cool.
michael_scott That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
kevin_malone Yeah, you said affected by it. Thanks again, Meredith.
meredith_palmer You're welcome.
michael_scott Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?
dwight_schrute No, I like Meredith.
dwight_schrute Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
michael_scott Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke? Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?
meredith_palmer I am fine.
michael_scott Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
meredith_palmer I know I drink. I like to party
michael_scott I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
meredith_palmer I am not an alcoholic!
michael_scott You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.
phyllis_vance I was waiting until later to hand out this years gifts from corporate. I don't think they're appropriate anymore.
angela_martin Please stop making me do these things.
phyllis_vance Oh, sorry, it's your job.
angela_martin But it's the season of mercy.
phyllis_vance You never showed me mercy when you were in charge. Why aren't you wearing the hairnet?
angela_martin I lost it.
phyllis_vance Ok... nice.
meredith_palmer I don't mind telling you that I have an addiction. I do. To p0rn.
michael_scott Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
dwight_schrute I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
dwight_schrute There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
michael_scott Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
dwight_schrute Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
michael_scott Dwight--
dwight_schrute She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
michael_scott ...okay.
dwight_schrute I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
jim_halpert Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
dwight_schrute Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
creed_bratton I can get you one in an hour.
dwight_schrute Really?
toby_flenderson Okay you know, this-- this is over.
stanley_hudson I agree.
jim_halpert Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
michael_scott Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
michael_scott You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better. That's my only wish. But you know what? My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.
jim_halpert They've been in there for 45 minutes.
pam_beesly I know. If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now.
phyllis_vance That's a halwa shabkia cookie. They serve it during Ramadan.
stanley_hudson Mmmm... chewy.
jim_halpert Hey.
andy_bernard What's up?
jim_halpert Do you take requests?
andy_bernard Sure.
jim_halpert Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
michael_scott I'll be down in a minute. Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?
toby_flenderson Sure. Wow. Ow...
meredith_palmer We just missed Poor Richards.
michael_scott We did?
meredith_palmer Yeah, I thought we were going out for a drink?
michael_scott Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.
meredith_palmer The Bog? Cooper's, Kelly's...
michael_scott We could go there, sure.
meredith_palmer ...Brixx's, Carmen's...
michael_scott Yes, yes.
meredith_palmer ...The Fort, Andy Gavin's.
michael_scott I have a new place.
meredith_palmer Well, it must have just opened up.
michael_scott It-- yep, recently.
meredith_palmer Yeah... all right.
michael_scott All right.
meredith_palmer Enough of this Christmas crap. Let's get some party music. Yeah!
michael_scott Yeah, oh there you go.
meredith_palmer Yeah!
michael_scott That's good.
meredith_palmer Yeah that's better.
michael_scott We're party girls.
toby_flenderson Hey Sasha, it's daddy. Have you ever heard of this doll , Princess Unicorn?
dad Daddy, daddy, daddy!!
toby_flenderson No, No, No. No, I'm just curious if you've heard of it.
toby_flenderson This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
dwight_schrute $200.
darryl_philbin Yo.
toby_flenderson Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
dwight_schrute Oh, that's my last one.
toby_flenderson Oh, no, I-- no, no, I was gonna buy that doll.
darryl_philbin Thanks man.
toby_flenderson I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
dwight_schrute Not my problem.
toby_flenderson But I-- I promised my daughter. Darryl, look-- I-- I need the doll, I need the doll. I-- I'm-- I'm begging you. I just-- I need it more than anything in this world. I need this doll. Darryl, man I need this doll.
darryl_philbin All right man, don't cry. It's cool. I'll let you get it for $400.
toby_flenderson I only have $200.
darryl_philbin You can owe me.
toby_flenderson Oh man, thanks, thank you, thank you, thank you.
darryl_philbin I know, right. Merry Christmas.
toby_flenderson Oh thanks. She's gonna... oh...
darryl_philbin Something wrong with the doll?
toby_flenderson No. It's even-- it's even better than the one I wanted.
meredith_palmer Sunrise Rehab? No! No! No! I told you no! There is no way!
michael_scott It's okay. It's all right.
meredith_palmer No way! There is no way! No way!
michael_scott Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on--
meredith_palmer No way! No way! There is no way!
michael_scott Here we go. This is gonna be good.
meredith_palmer No! No way! I told you. We talked about this. There is absolutely no way. No! No! There is no way! No! No! I am not going in there! I am not going in there!
michael_scott Yes you are.
meredith_palmer I am not going in there! NO!!
meredith_palmer Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait! Just wait!
michael_scott Shhh... just calm down.
meredith_palmer Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! No! No!
michael_scott Come on. Shh...
meredith_palmer No! No! No! There is no way! There is no way!
michael_scott Here's the door. Here's the door.
meredith_palmer There is no way! There is no way! No! No!
michael_scott Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
meredith_palmer This man is crazy! This man is crazy!
Rehab#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode10 Nurse Can I help you?
michael_scott I have a deposit. Alcoholic.
meredith_palmer No! No! No! No! No!
michael_scott So do I sign?
meredith_palmer NO!!!
phyllis_vance I need you to put the Christmas tree back up.
angela_martin It's outside.
phyllis_vance I didn't ask you where it was. I told you where it needs to be.
angela_martin Shut up.
phyllis_vance Excuse me?
angela_martin I'm not moving the tree. Face it. The only power you have over me is this big secret that I know you're not going to tell. And you want to know how I know that? Because then you won't be able to plan your stupid, tacky parties anymore. So you move the tree.
phyllis_vance Okay. Angela's having s*x with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
dwight_schrute Well don't look so surprised.
pam_beesly I knew it.
jim_halpert You did not know it.
pam_beesly I knew some of it.
jim_halpert Everyone knew some of it.
pam_beesly It's Christmas.
jim_halpert You knew it.
pam_beesly Thank you. I knew it.
jim_halpert She knew it.
michael_scott As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will. They have to do it voluntarily. They have to hit rock bottom. So I think I know what I need to do at this point. I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom. Um... I think I can do it. I did it with Jan.
andy_bernard All right, everybody's still here. Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on. Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer. Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la. Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA. Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo.
angela_martin I think I'd like to go home now.
andy_bernard Sure. Dooo. Tough room. Come on. I just learned it. Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
