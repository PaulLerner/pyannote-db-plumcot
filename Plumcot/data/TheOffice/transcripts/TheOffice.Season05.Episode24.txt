kevin_malone At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili. The trick is to undercook the onions. Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot. I'm serious about this stuff. I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes. I toast my own Ancho chilies. It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations. It's probably the thing I do best.
michael_scott Someone is returning! He started his own company, and now he's back. Who could it be? I'll give you a hint. He is a man. A man you have missed with all your heart. A man who has ruined all other men for you. Who is it?
ryan_howard Who is it?
pam_beesly Who is it?
michael_scott It's Michael Scott. Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes.
michael_scott Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan. And how about casual Friday again, huh? Reinstituting casual Friday? You all look great. What I want to do right now is try something a little different. I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting. I want you guys to run it. I want you to say whatever you want, take it away. Your meeting.
dwight_schrute Wh--what are you doing?
michael_scott If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
angela_martin Okay.
michael_scott Yes.
angela_martin People are dressed inappropriately.
michael_scott Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different.
jim_halpert Can you give us a hint?
michael_scott When I needed salespeople for my new paper company, everyone here turned their back on me. Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness? No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No. Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No. I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
michael_scott Oscar, what were you going to say?
oscar_martinez Nothing. I didn't say anything.
michael_scott All right.
erin_hannon Do I still have a job here?
michael_scott Not important. Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
dwight_schrute Wait, what?
stanley_hudson How is that going to work?
michael_scott It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
phyllis_vance You mean the clients you stole from us.
dwight_schrute Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
michael_scott No, you lost those clients.
andy_bernard I call foul, sir.
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
michael_scott Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can.
meredith_palmer Don't fall in love with me, kid.
pam_beesly Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
phyllis_vance It sure looked good on the mannequin.
pam_beesly Well, you have good taste.
phyllis_vance Well, thanks. I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
pam_beesly What?
phyllis_vance Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them? That I didn't have enough time for them?
pam_beesly Oh, I, um...
phyllis_vance Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout.
angela_martin The man is wearing sandals. I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work. Gross! I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
toby_flenderson Can't you just not look at his feet?
angela_martin Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby? So trained to deal with a hysterical woman. I don't want to look at his feet. Do your job!
toby_flenderson Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have s*x with this girl, Cathy. Followed her to Scranton. Took the first job I could find in H.R. Later she divorced me. So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
michael_scott There you are, my friend.
ryan_howard Oh, thanks, man.
michael_scott Pamela.
pam_beesly Thank, Michael.
michael_scott Yep.
dwight_schrute Fresh hot ink.
stanley_hudson "New File System".
dwight_schrute Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
stanley_hudson I am not changing the way I do my files.
dwight_schrute No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
dwight_schrute When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine.
oscar_martinez I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
toby_flenderson I could loan you a pair of socks.
oscar_martinez No.
toby_flenderson No, they're clean. I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
oscar_martinez I don't think so.
andy_bernard Andrew Bernard.
dwight_schrute Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
andy_bernard What are you still doing not at your desk?
dwight_schrute Did you even read the memo?
andy_bernard All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
dwight_schrute No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
andy_bernard Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
dwight_schrute Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing.
dwight_schrute We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
jim_halpert Can I address that?
dwight_schrute No, you're too close.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
stanley_hudson It's not right. I don't like it.
dwight_schrute He doesn't like it.
phyllis_vance You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary. No offense, Jim. I think she's very pretty.
dwight_schrute Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?
meredith_palmer I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
dwight_schrute Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
phyllis_vance Those sound too harsh.
dwight_schrute No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things.
jim_halpert Of course. What is like a hostage?
dwight_schrute Excellent question.
andy_bernard We could write a strong-worded letter.
dwight_schrute Words will never be enough.
jim_halpert Strongly-painted picture.
dwight_schrute No, pictures are too interpretive.
jim_halpert Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
dwight_schrute Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs.
jim_halpert Great. See you upstairs.
dwight_schrute C'mon. Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action--
pam_beesly That one's great.
michael_scott I know.
ryan_howard You look so classy in that picture.
michael_scott I do? Well--Where is that bowl?
jim_halpert Hey, you have a second?
michael_scott Michael Scott Paper Company only.
jim_halpert Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
michael_scott Okay, well---
ryan_howard Tough.
michael_scott I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
jim_halpert This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now.
michael_scott Against who?
ryan_howard You. Us.
pam_beesly What?
ryan_howard It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
michael_scott The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott. They are in for a bitter surprise. I am not to be truffled with.
michael_scott Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me. You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
pam_beesly Mm-hmmm.
michael_scott That was us, right there.
pam_beesly We were something else.
ryan_howard What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
michael_scott Mm-hmm.
ryan_howard Chiklis style.
michael_scott Yeah, the Commish.
ryan_howard Yes, but Chiklis Shield style. Not Commish style.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
creed_bratton It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
jim_halpert I know. Yeah, it's...kinda--
creed_bratton Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
jim_halpert That's true. That's right. Yeah.
creed_bratton Want to play a game?
michael_scott Hey gang. Where you been?
dwight_schrute Lunch.
michael_scott Where'd you eat?
phyllis_vance A restaurant.
michael_scott What'd you have, Stanley?
andy_bernard I had a salmon salad. With water, no ice. I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it. Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
stanley_hudson I had Mexican food.
michael_scott So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you? Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon.
ryan_howard That looks great.
michael_scott Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?
ryan_howard I can eat.
michael_scott I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
dwight_schrute It's pony.
michael_scott Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
andy_bernard Dijonnaise.
michael_scott Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys.
pam_beesly Mmm.
toby_flenderson Hey, Meredith. Can I talk to you privately for a second?
meredith_palmer About what?
toby_flenderson Your outfit.
meredith_palmer What? What's wrong with my outfit?
toby_flenderson You--you might consider pulling it down a touch. It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
meredith_palmer A bunch of prudes. You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals, but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes? Is that how it goes?
oscar_martinez Meredith, your boob is out.
meredith_palmer Fine.
angela_martin Meredith, too far!
kelly_kapoor Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
meredith_palmer It's casual day. Happy?
creed_bratton No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that. IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
jim_halpert Well, what if I just do this?
creed_bratton You don't want to do that.
jim_halpert I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over. With Creed. Playing chess. At work. He's winning. I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
ryan_howard I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better?
dwight_schrute Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
ryan_howard Exactly.
dwight_schrute That's my client.
ryan_howard Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.
dwight_schrute Give me the phone.
ryan_howard Things have been generally good.
dwight_schrute Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
ryan_howard Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
dwight_schrute Hi, Mr. Bart.
ryan_howard At these prices with this service...
dwight_schrute Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone.
ryan_howard You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up.
ryan_howard No, no, no. Sir, don't listen.
dwight_schrute I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness. Ryan!
phyllis_vance Ryan, hand the phone over.
ryan_howard Stop flustering me, everybody!
stanley_hudson Who let this boy on the phone?
dwight_schrute Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years!
pam_beesly You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan.
dwight_schrute You're a secretary! What do you know?
ryan_howard Okay.
dwight_schrute And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone. I'm confiscating this.
michael_scott Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.
dwight_schrute We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
michael_scott Who quits?
phyllis_vance Me.
stanley_hudson And me.
andy_bernard Me too.
michael_scott You guys gotta be kidding.
dwight_schrute No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
michael_scott I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money. There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one.
stanley_hudson You want us to apologize to you?
michael_scott Yes I do.
andy_bernard That's completely backwards.
michael_scott It's frontward's.
phyllis_vance Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt. You should be apologizing to us.
stanley_hudson That's right.
dwight_schrute Right.
phyllis_vance Michael, you always said we were a family. Then you went after us.
michael_scott No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong. And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways. From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others. And the bottom line, I am in the wrong. I'm the bad guy.
michael_scott I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
dwight_schrute Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?
michael_scott Whatever you guys did earlier.
dwight_schrute I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
michael_scott Just do it, okay?
dwight_schrute I'll do--
michael_scott Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
dwight_schrute I'll do the best I can.
michael_scott Are you kidding me?
dwight_schrute Deceit does not come easy to me.
michael_scott Okay, okay, okay.
erin_hannon I really love your outfit.
kelly_kapoor Thank you so much for saying that. I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
erin_hannon You look like J-Lo.
michael_scott So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
stanley_hudson Are you giving us our clients back?
michael_scott If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, "apology accepted", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
stanley_hudson Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
michael_scott They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
phyllis_vance Michael, just give us our clients back. That's all we care about.
michael_scott Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
stanley_hudson So?
michael_scott Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. However, I rescind my apology.
dwight_schrute That's fair.
michael_scott You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
darryl_philbin What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
ryan_howard Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
pam_beesly He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now. He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
ryan_howard I think you should get it. You really grew into it.
pam_beesly Oh. I think you should get it. You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
ryan_howard If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael? That would go a long way coming from you.
pam_beesly Yeah.
ryan_howard Thanks.
creed_bratton So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
jim_halpert Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
creed_bratton I thought you were gay.
jim_halpert Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
creed_bratton I don't know.
michael_scott Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
jim_halpert Sure. Let me just finish this turn.
michael_scott And Bingo was his name. Let's go.
creed_bratton Challenge.
michael_scott I need your help. This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
jim_halpert I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan. You know that.
michael_scott You're close with Pam too.
jim_halpert Eh, she's nice, I guess. You know what? Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
michael_scott Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
jim_halpert Well, that's--
michael_scott I like his hair.
jim_halpert Cons, Ryan. He defrauded the company. He has never made a sale.
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert He definitely stole my iPod.
michael_scott That sounds pretty biased.
jim_halpert You didn't hear my pros. Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
michael_scott Okay. Pam, pros.
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
michael_scott I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice.
jim_halpert That's not true.
michael_scott I don't need to tell you that.
jim_halpert I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
michael_scott I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
jim_halpert And I won't.
michael_scott Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
jim_halpert All right. You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill. But that's not a weird voice.
michael_scott Oh, wow! Whoa!
jim_halpert Take it easy.
michael_scott Ho-ho, man! Wow. Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have s*x with you unless you bring out the garba--
michael_scott I have a very difficult decision to make. It's like last week I was at the video store. Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice? It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
andy_bernard You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
toby_flenderson All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
dwight_schrute Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
toby_flenderson All right, come. Sit down, Dwight.
dwight_schrute No.
toby_flenderson I'm running this meeting.
dwight_schrute That's debatable.
toby_flenderson It's not. It's not. Sit down or I am writing you up.
meredith_palmer Ooh, where has this guy been?
toby_flenderson Casual Fridays are cancelled. Let's just not do it anymore.
andy_bernard You're running from the problem.
toby_flenderson There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
michael_scott Pam, can you come in here, please? Have a seat. Well, there's no easy way of saying this. So I think I will just...drag it out. Since the dawn of time there has been--
pam_beesly Just tell me.
michael_scott I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--
pam_beesly No, okay.
michael_scott I'm sorry, sorry.
pam_beesly Okay, I get it. Why are you giggling? Is this a joke? Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
michael_scott Yes, you did.
pam_beesly I did?
michael_scott Yep.
pam_beesly For real, you're not kidding?
michael_scott No, you--no.
pam_beesly I did?
michael_scott No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great.
pam_beesly Oh, Michael, thank you. Thank you.
michael_scott Oh, oh!
pam_beesly Thank you. You will not be sorry.
michael_scott You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
pam_beesly Oh. I really thought I didn't get it.
michael_scott Oh, really?
pam_beesly Yeah. 'Cause you said I didn't
michael_scott Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.
pam_beesly What about Ryan?
michael_scott I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
pam_beesly Yeah. Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
michael_scott I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here.
pam_beesly Thanks, Michael.
michael_scott Oh! What's our receptionists name?
pam_beesly Erin.
michael_scott Could you send her in?
pam_beesly Erin. Michael wants to see you.
michael_scott Hello.
erin_hannon Hi.
michael_scott Have a seat.
michael_scott This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go. Hank, could you come up here please? Hank is our security guard--
erin_hannon Oh, I can go.
michael_scott He will be ushering you out.
erin_hannon Oh!
michael_scott Oh, your face! Oh!
erin_hannon Is--do the people--
michael_scott No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet.
erin_hannon Oh!
michael_scott Oh...
erin_hannon Do they not like me, though?
michael_scott I don't know, actually.
erin_hannon Okay.
