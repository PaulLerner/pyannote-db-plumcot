michael_scott There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. Michael Scott, as seen on TV.
todd_packer Packer I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener... It's Packer!
michael_scott OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
michael_scott Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.
michael_scott Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
oscar_martinez What's number one?
michael_scott Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
jim_halpert So instead of working, you want...
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
angela_martin Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
phyllis_vance Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
michael_scott Please.
dwight_schrute Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
michael_scott Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. It's trying to stand up... there it goes.
jo_bennett Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
michael_scott Jo! We were not expecting you!
jo_bennett 'Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here.
kevin_malone No.
jo_bennett Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go.
kevin_malone Jo, I think that I know what happened.
jo_bennett I'm not sure you do, teddy bear.
kevin_malone Well, now I think I might not.
jo_bennett Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.
michael_scott Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
jo_bennett Can you now?
michael_scott Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
phyllis_vance Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
andy_bernard If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
andy_bernard So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
jo_bennett It's a little form, says "I did not do it."
michael_scott There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
jo_bennett All that's just birthday information, Michael.
michael_scott Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
jo_bennett Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say?
michael_scott Okay.
jo_bennett When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one question What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, "Come down on him with that swift hammer of justice!", innocent. A clear conscience don't need no mercy. But if they said "Officer Bessie, well they may have had a reason, blah blah blah blah", well nine times out of ten, that's the anus they'd check.
jo_bennett So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?
michael_scott We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
jo_bennett Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay.
michael_scott Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
jo_bennett Well, I guess we're all right, Michael.
michael_scott I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
jo_bennett Yeah.
michael_scott Okay.
nick Hey Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hey, IT guy.
nick Mind if I get in there for a second?
dwight_schrute Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
nick Just one... Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?
dwight_schrute Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
oscar_martinez The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
dwight_schrute You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
kevin_malone Wait, are they searching all our computers?
nick Yeah. I already got to yours, Kevin.
kevin_malone No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
angela_martin Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
michael_scott Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
phyllis_vance Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
jo_bennett Okay Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... You should fire the following people.
jo_bennett Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
dwight_schrute Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
jo_bennett Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?
dwight_schrute Are you referring to alchemy?
jo_bennett I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy.
dwight_schrute I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
jo_bennett Well, buy property. That's my advice.
michael_scott Is there something that you would like to say to me?
andy_bernard Uh...
michael_scott About talking to the press?
andy_bernard I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
michael_scott Mmhmm.
andy_bernard Okay? I, I... didn't do it.
michael_scott I don't believe you.
andy_bernard I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
michael_scott That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
andy_bernard I don't care, that's how much I swear!
michael_scott Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
andy_bernard I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
michael_scott Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
darryl_philbin Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
michael_scott Oh, no, no, no...
darryl_philbin I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
michael_scott Oh my god. Was she cute?
darryl_philbin No.
michael_scott Oh, god, Darryl!
michael_scott I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.
jo_bennett Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.
toby_flenderson Well, that's...
jo_bennett And we didn't find anything on your computer.
toby_flenderson Good.
jo_bennett Except this.
toby_flenderson Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
jo_bennett I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?
toby_flenderson Oh, uh, I don't know, uh...
jo_bennett The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.
toby_flenderson Oh... yes.
toby_flenderson Write your own damn novel.
pam_beesly It was me.
jim_halpert What was you? You were the leak?
pam_beesly Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
jim_halpert Uh-huh.
pam_beesly She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
jim_halpert Why'd you do that?
pam_beesly Her husband's a reporter.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
jim_halpert Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
pam_beesly I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
jim_halpert This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
michael_scott You leaked it?
pam_beesly I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
michael_scott I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
pam_beesly That fast?
michael_scott Oh.
michael_scott Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
pam_beesly Yeah? I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
michael_scott So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
pam_beesly Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
pam_beesly I have never seen so many parking tickets.
darryl_philbin All right, this is just messed up.
michael_scott No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
darryl_philbin All right.
michael_scott What do we got?
pam_beesly Um...
kelly_kapoor Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
pam_beesly We're not going for yogurt.
michael_scott It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
kelly_kapoor Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
michael_scott Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
kelly_kapoor Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
ryan_howard Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. I just sent myself a Woof.
erin_hannon Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
ryan_howard Thank you, Erin. Woof!
michael_scott Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
pam_beesly Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
michael_scott No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
kelly_kapoor That idea sucks.
pam_beesly I don't think that's a good idea.
michael_scott Just don't say no.
darryl_philbin Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
kelly_kapoor Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
michael_scott That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
pam_beesly Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
michael_scott Okay. You can count on me.
dwight_schrute Let me give you a hand.
toby_flenderson I'm hungry.
dwight_schrute Ready? Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? Dwight Schrute.
Realtor#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode26 The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.
dwight_schrute Basement office? You mean like a lair?
michael_scott Hey Jo.
jo_bennett Michael.
michael_scott I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
jo_bennett Michael Scott... what do you know?
michael_scott What?
michael_scott It doesn't matter what I know.
jo_bennett If it doesn't matter, then tell me.
michael_scott Why?
jo_bennett Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
michael_scott Well, deal with this.
jo_bennett Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak. Come with me.
michael_scott What?
gabe_lewis Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
michael_scott Are you going to kill me?
jo_bennett Hahahahahaha.
Realtor#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode26 I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.
dwight_schrute Okay.
Realtor#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode26 What time works for you? Mr. Schrute, what time works?
dwight_schrute Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Realtor#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode26 But...
michael_scott Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
creed_bratton I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
gabe_lewis All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.
stanley_hudson It wasn't me.
gabe_lewis What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it.
andy_bernard What? Based on what?
gabe_lewis Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
dwight_schrute All right. Sounds good.
jim_halpert Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
jim_halpert Really?
jo_bennett Michael.
michael_scott I have rights.
jo_bennett Let's just talk.
michael_scott I am not going to tell you anything.
jo_bennett Honey, you don't seem like your normal self.
michael_scott Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
jo_bennett Mama Jo knew there was something up.
michael_scott Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
jo_bennett Oh, I hate that.
michael_scott And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
jo_bennett Who's Holly?
michael_scott Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
kevin_malone Well, I think that the real question is Who is the whistleblower?
dwight_schrute Oh, just...
david_wallace Wallace I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
andy_bernard Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
jim_halpert I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
pam_beesly Yes, it's totally obvious.
creed_bratton I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. It's Angela. Get her, boys.
nick Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.
gabe_lewis Uh, not now.
nick Oh yeah, it's just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would...
stanley_hudson Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
phyllis_vance I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
nick My name is Nick.
angela_martin Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
nick Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me.
jim_halpert Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
nick You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?
jim_halpert No... sport.
nick You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?
dwight_schrute Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and p0rn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
nick Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what? You're not a photographer. And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you. This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out.
andy_bernard You're going to believe that guy?
jo_bennett When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me.
michael_scott Hmm, hmm.
jo_bennett I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.
michael_scott You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
jo_bennett Oh honey, surely you don't want that.
michael_scott I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. You were playing too.
dwight_schrute I'm about to buy this building, you know.
hank You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
dwight_schrute Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
andy_bernard Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
phyllis_vance You deserve it.
andy_bernard Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
kevin_malone No, it does not!
andy_bernard Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
angela_martin It does!
erin_hannon Andy?
andy_bernard Hey.
erin_hannon I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
andy_bernard Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
erin_hannon Yeah.
michael_scott We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
jo_bennett Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.
michael_scott That was fun.
jo_bennett I hope your rough patch ends soon.
michael_scott Thanks. Today helped.
jo_bennett Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.
michael_scott Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
jo_bennett Let me see what I can do.
