ryan Wuphf. com!
kelly Ryan, we're doing the dance!
ryan This is how you build a business. This is how you make it in this country.
creed You got Creed.
ryan -and you jump in front of them.
kelly You make it so hard to love you sometimes.
stanley Still behind.
angela I said I didn't want to be on the internet!
andy Go, go, go, go!
michael 
all Streamers!
dwight Hiya! Ha!
phyllis Dwight!
stanley Are you crazy?
andy Toby, how did we do?
toby Well, that was better.
andy Whoo! We did it!
michael I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception. ' Or at least I dreamt I did.
andy Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.
erin Yes, of course.
andy And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.
erin Who's the guy who invented the peanut?
gabe Hey, guys.
andy Hey!
gabe Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt.
andy Not at all.
gabe I'm gonna head back to Siberia there. Ciao.
gabe I started dating erin this summer. It has been, in a word, exquisite.
erin gabe is awesome. He has accomplished so much career-wise and height-wise. Thank God he's my boss because I would not have said yes to a first date if I didn't have to, but. it's been great.
andy Am I angry that gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.
pam Hey. What are you doing?
dwight From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
kevin Well, what if you're cold?
dwight Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
jim Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear.
dwight Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
dwight dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
kelly This summer, I did the minority executive training program at Yale. You guys, I'm, like, really smart now. You don't even know. You could ask me, "Kelly, what's the biggest company in the world?" And I'd be like, "blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah, " giving you the exact right answer.
luke Coffee Monkey's arrived.
oscar The coffee's supposed to be here at 9.
luke Here you go, Big O. Tiny. darryl Hannah.
darryl It says decaf. You get me decaf?
luke Ooh, yeah. Must've been some sort of mix-up there. You could just drink it, or I could drive all the way back?
darryl My summer, I, um, blew out my knee playing softball. Ended up watching CNN most of the time. I don't know how we're going to get out of Afghanistan. I hate the new assistant. He's only been here for a week, and I hate him.
andy New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.
luke My name is luke Cooper. I love cinema. My favorite movies are Citizen Kane and The Boondock Saints.
andy That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.
michael He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. Ah! It's not cappuccino.
oscar He messed yours up to.
darryl He's got to go, Mike.
michael It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
jim Wow, that's a lot of keys.
dwight The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
jim That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
dwight Where?
jim I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these.
dwight Give me that.
jim Yep. Wait, and this.
dwight Yes.
jim Go get 'em.
jim What happened to me this summer? dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
dwight Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
pam Sorry.
jim Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but.
pam It was really funny.
jim Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
pam I love you.
phyllis Luke? Luke!
luke What's up, Venus?
phyllis Did you send those samples to Justin at Lehigh Motors yesterday? Because he didn't get 'em.
luke Uh, if you asked me to do it, I'm sure I did it. Yeah, strawberries are ripe.
meredith Hey, turn off the Chumbawamba and scram, twerp.
luke You don't have to yell.
michael Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
luke What for?
michael To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
michael And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.
michael Having luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years a- 14. The last time I saw luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.
michael Don't bother Luke.
pam Why is there a circle with a line through it?
michael That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
phyllis Yeah, but it's like you're saying we should bother Luke.
michael No, it. Yes, okay, right. all right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go.
darryl Don't don't bother Luke. Got it.
michael Come on. Okay, um. That's as clear as I can make it.
phyllis Hey, why can't we bother Luke? He deserves it.
michael Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
dwight Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
gabe That'd be hilarious. Uh, "Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em. "
michael Nope, it won't be gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
dwight How close?
michael Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
dwight Yes. Of course.
toby Guys, I think michael and luke are related.
michael No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.
all What?
michael luke is my nephew.
oscar Michael, that's nepotism. luke is getting special treatment because he's your nephew.
michael Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
darryl What's wrong with a level playing field?
michael Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
jim Oh, man, so many points being made.
creed I couldn't care less about nepotism. But, I'm loving the debate. Great minds battling it out. And I've got a front row seat. . push;
michael God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.
erin That's a really tight argument.
michael Thank you.
jim But you're comparing you and luke to God and Jesus.
michael No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
oscar This is hypothetical. We're talking about luke who happens to be terrible.
michael Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
kelly I would just like to say something off of what darryl said about the level playing field. That is actually a zoning issue. So, thank you.
oscar If there's nothing wrong with this, Michael, why have you been keeping it a secret?
michael Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great. " And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes. " And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
erin Hey! Ice cream afternoon!
michael Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
kevin Wait, soy ice cream? Did you get real ice cream?
pam Or enough for everyone?
luke No, man. There was no list. Uh, but I got bagel chips.
oscar Ah, my favorite part of an ice cream party. The bagel chips.
andy Clutch cream run, bro.
pam Get whatever you want, on me.
jim You really think you can make it up to me with food?
pam I don't know. That usually works.
pam I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.
angela I came down here to feed the feral cats like I usually do and I found something unsavory in the back of your nephew's car.
michael Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
phyllis Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight. He never bothered to send them.
michael all right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
jim Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, "I don't own an Ebay store, " so.
michael Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
oscar Oh sure, those are the expense reports that corporate was waiting for yesterday.
stanley Let's just make this kid open this damn car.
erin Oh my gosh, those are the pants he wanted to return to Talbots.
michael I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
andy You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself. by calling Tripple A.
michael Wait a minute.
meredith I'm in.
michael Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
oscar Yep, here they are.
phyllis Yep, I just lost a client cause I swore I sent these samples on time.
andy This kid's costing us sales, Michael.
erin I'm sorry, do you want to try them on again to see.
michael No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.
jo Why is this my problem, Michael?
michael Because gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
gabe Those overnight packages needed to go out, and michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable.
jo Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy.
michael You don't have all the facts.
jo Which are?
michael I love him.
jo Oh, God. How far has it gone?
michael No. No. He's my nephew.
jo Well, I got a nephew too. But he don't work for me. You know why? Cause he's a screw-up. He can swim in my pool but he can't come in my house.
michael Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
jo If you keep him, Michael, I'm gonna hold you accountable for him. You're on the hook for this kid. You got that? Cover his ass like tighty-whities.
michael I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
jo Was how I put it not clear enough? I mean, you had to go and make up your own saying? Deal with it, boys.
michael luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.
kevin Oh, yeah. This'll be easy. So just, like, rearrange the buttons and stuff.
pam Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses "Doors closed" the doors open. Or he presses "lobby" it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?
kevin Yeah. Let me take a look at the circus board.
pam dwight is about to get so Pammed.
dwight Hey, did you SMS text message me?
pam Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
dwight Okay, that's weird. Just hitting "door closed. " What?
pam There we go.
dwight Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
pam Let's just calm down.
dwight Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
pam I don't-
dwight Use your talons! Pry 'em open!
pam Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
dwight Well, don't look, freak!
pam Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
dwight I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
pam You've gotta be kidding me.
michael luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!
luke What? I'm stopping it. That's what you said.
michael Give me the pointer.
luke So you just want me to move it? You're being totally unclear here. I'm just gonna go ahead and move it.
michael No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
luke all right, fine. Fine. I'll just go.
michael Okay.
luke I'm gone.
michael all right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
andy Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.
angela Michael, do something.
meredith Sack up, man.
michael Okay, can I have that?
luke No.
michael Ok, I am going to count down from five.
both Five, four.
michael I'm not kidding.
both Three, two, one.
michael Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
luke No!
michael You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
luke What the?
michael That's what you're going to do, Luke!
luke What the hell was that?
michael I had to do that.
luke Hey, this! Screw it!
michael all right. Are we good? You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
kevin That was awesome!
stanley Texas justice.
kelly Yeah, your nephew is so lame.
creed He's been trashing us relentlessly on Twitter. Yeah, it's funny stuff, but mean.
jim You follow him on Twitter?
creed Everywhere I look it's Betty White this and Betty White that. Finally a kid that's not talking about Betty White. Of course I follow him.
gabe Michael, you just physically assaulted an employee. Can we talk in private?
michael Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
jim Pam?
pam Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.
jim I did not do this.
pam I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.
jim This is impressive.
pam Well, you know. they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.
jim Do they call you that?
pam They do call me that.
jim Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
pam Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.
jim Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
pam Yeah.
jim Great.
dwight How ya doin'?
jim Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
pam Stop drinking the water! Stop!
andy No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.
michael Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.
andy Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!
gabe Legal says the best way to protect us from a lawsuit is to call this a stress-induced outburst. You will have to undergo six sessions of counseling.
michael That's it? Really? That's nothing. all right. That's highway robbery.
gabe Good. Well, that's the spirit.
michael I can do that.
gabe And, uh, you will do your counseling right here, because our HR staff are all certified counselors.
michael Okay. Wait, what?
toby Yeah, I'm really looking forward to working with you, Michael.
michael Is there another option?
gabe The alternative is termination.
