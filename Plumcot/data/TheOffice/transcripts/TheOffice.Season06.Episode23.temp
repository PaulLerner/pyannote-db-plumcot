michael Buenos dias, Erin.
erin Buenos dias, Miguel. Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
michael No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
michael I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for. for all of North America. And. I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
michael Buenos dias, Jaime.
jim Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
michael Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
dwight Guten tag, Herr Michael.
dwight I don't understand why michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
michael La telefona.
oscar El telefono.
oscar Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um. I should have been more specific.
oscar Your office is full of genitalia.
michael Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
oscar "That's what he says?"
michael Damn it. Ah, Angelo.
angela Angela. Michael.
michael Yo soy Cancun.
angela Uhh!
jim all right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
pam You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um. like, "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee. "
jim Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
michael Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
dwight You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
michael I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
dwight If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
jim That's a good point.
pam This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
jim Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
pam We have good give and take. I give, he takes.
jim I don't even know who you are anymore.
pam Yee.
donna Hi, uh, donna Newton, here to see michael Scott.
jim Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
donna Hi!
jim How are you?
michael Did somebody order a hooker over here?
donna Oh, stop that.
michael Hi. How are you?
michael There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid &amp; Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so.
michael Right here, we have the wonder twins, jim and pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
donna You look exactly alike.
pam Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
donna I have a sense about these things.
jim all right.
donna You have some ancestors in common. somewhere back.
angela I knew it. You should see their baby.
jim So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate So it's a tradeoff.
michael Hi.
jim Hold on one second.
michael Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
jim What?
michael Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
jim None of this is time sensitive.
michael Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
donna Oh, yeah, thank you.
michael Okay, I have more of them.
gabe You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
darryl Sounds all right.
dwight What is this?
gabe Oh, this is "Print in all Colors, " Sabre's minority executive training program.
dwight It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
darryl I didn't say "a'ight. "
dwight How do I apply?
gabe You have to be a minority.
dwight Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
gabe Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
dwight Come here. Come here.
gabe Hmm?
dwight Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
gabe Well.
darryl I like the sound of this. Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
dwight One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm. the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
kelly This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. all right? Thanks for nothing.
dwight Oh, man. White people, right?
kelly I don't know if she was white.
dwight Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
kelly Yeah.
dwight I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
kelly Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
dwight I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
kelly Never thought of myself as an executive before.
dwight I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
kelly I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
dwight You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
kelly I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
dwight That's not. she's. okay. Yes.
michael I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you. there we go! Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
donna Mm-hmm.
michael And that would be a display of the crisp, gorgeous black.
donna Yeah.
michael It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
michael This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
donna Who took the photo?
michael Ryan.
donna Oh.
michael And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
donna Not bad.
michael Oh, thanks. You're not bad, either.
donna Thank you. Hmm.
michael Hmm.
donna Oh my God.
michael Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
michael You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
jim No.
pam I'll have one.
jim Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
michael Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
jim Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
pam Maybe michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
donna Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
michael Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
pam What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
jim What?
jim What was that?
pam Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
jim Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
pam Who cares? It's not that huge a sale.
jim Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
pam Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. Good luck, wingman.
dwight How as being a minority affected you?
kelly Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
dwight Oh, good, and you resent this because.
kelly Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
dwight Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
kelly Just put it in your pocket. michael and
donna 
kevin Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
phyllis You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
creed You ever notice you can ooze two
things sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
phyllis She just crossed her arms together. that's bad.
pam Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
kevin Like that?
donna Is this. is this the best you can do right there?
jim Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
donna Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
jim Yeah.
michael So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
jim What's that?
michael Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
jim I don't. I don't think so.
michael I think we could.
oscar I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost.
michael Okay, well sometimes. sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
oscar Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
michael Why don't you run them again?
jim What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
michael If she is, it's working.
kevin Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says "no, " then she is not interested.
jim She does not like him.
pam You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
jim 'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
pam I was after your money.
jim Well, the joke was on you.
pam Yes, it was.
kelly Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
ryan Okay.
dwight Hey. what are you guys doing?
kelly This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I. M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
ryan Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
kelly Oh, that is so good.
dwight You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
kelly Oh, that's okay. ryan coached me.
dwight Ryan? What does he know?
ryan It's easy. you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
kelly Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
dwight "We?"
kelly When I become executive, I'm gonna make ryan manager.
ryan And then the two of us are cleanin' house. . push;
dwight kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
michael So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller.
donna Mm-hmm.
michael Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. Just kidding. Do you like mints?
donna Yes.
michael I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
donna Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
michael They're good
donna You want one?
michael Sure.
donna It's like cool. "certified cool. " I like how they say "certified. " Like there's some consortium of. Michael!
michael I can't stop myself from kissing her.
kevin Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&amp;M's all day.
andy Well, why don't you just move the M&amp;M's?
kevin Well, why don't you shut up!
michael Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
jim It is totally insane.
oscar Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
michael Okay. What do you think?
kevin I think it's over, man.
michael Andy?
andy Ehh.
michael Okay, some for, some against.
jim Nobody's for.
michael Pam?
pam Hmm?
mihael What do you think?
pam Um. I think it's really, really unlikely.
jim Okay.
pam Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
jim What?
pam I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
michael I'm going with Pam's group.
jim Wait.
michael Here we go.
jim Michael. Michael.
michael Okay.
jim Michael.
michael No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just. thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
jim No.
michael What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not. the point.
dwight kelly is disqualified!
gabe What?
dwight You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well. anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
gabe Yeah, but she's not white, though.
dwight Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, darryl is far more ethnic.
gabe darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
darryl I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
dwight kelly is the only applicant.
gabe Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
kelly Namaste.
dwight Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
kelly Hello.
gabe That's very nice. I never noticed that before.
kelly Sometimes my bangs cover it.
gabe Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh. may I ask you what that means?
kelly I do find that offensive, actually.
michael We should have your contract done by Thursday.
donna Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
michael Okay.
donna And, um. you know I just wanted to say it was really. really nice to do business with you.
michael Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
donna Thank you. Did I. get everything?
michael I don't know. I think so.
donna Yeah, I think so.
michael Okay. So. Oh, Donna?
donna Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't. we don't validate.
donna No, it's just in the lot, so.
michael Thank you so much.
donna You're welcome. You're. welcome.
michael Mmm.
donna Bye.
michael Ahem. So, um. okay, if you have. if there's any other questions that you have.
donna I don't have, uh, any other questions. I'm just gonna. make my way down to.
michael all right. all right. Bye.
donna Bye-bye!
michael And have a good elevator ride.
donna Okay.
michael Oh, what's that out there?
kevin Michael, how did it go?
dwight How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
erin Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
dwight I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
erin I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
dwight What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
stanley Dwight, I know these programs. "Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow. "
dwight Yes.
stanley I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
erin Mm!
dwight Speaking of rainbows, Oscar. you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
oscar Dwight, we know kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
dwight I can protect you from Kelly. Will you get out of here? Seriously.
kelly For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
dwight Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program "print in all colors" initiative.
kelly 
dwight What are you doing?
dwight Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
kelly God, I hate you so much!
dwight Caucasians, am I right? Have a seat. I'll translate.
hide Why? I don't need translator.
dwight You don't know what you need. Just.
gabe Well, uh. why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
hide In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand.
pam Hey, Michael. How you doing?
michael I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
pam You know what, Michael? For what it's worth. I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
michael She suckered you too.
pam Mm-hmm.
michael Was it the cleavage?
pam Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
michael Yep.
phyllis Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It. it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
andy You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh. I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
erin Michael, I think donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
michael God. She left this here?
erin Yeah.
michael Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
jim What?
all No.
michael Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
oscar It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
pam Michael.
michael Well.
pam She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
michael Yeah, I know. I know.
pam I'm sorry.
michael I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
pam Michael!
michael 
donna Michael!
michael Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
gabe Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. all right.
gabe They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
kelly And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
erin Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
kelly Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
erin Great.
dwight Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it.
kelly Thank you, Dwight.
dwight Oh.
kelly I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
dwight Gosh. He he.
kelly Because I never forget anything.
dwight Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
michael You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So. there's your barrette.
donna No, y-you were. right.
michael Who?
donna You were right.
michael About what?
donna You were right. I'm sorry.
michael No, no. No.
donna I'm sor.
michael No.
michael What happened?
erin kelly got into the minority training program.
michael Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! I kissed. We kissed.
kevin Ooh.
phyllis Oh, Michael.
michael No, I'm serious. It. this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was. I returned her barrette We ki. We did. Okay. We did. We did.
michael You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. I did do it!
