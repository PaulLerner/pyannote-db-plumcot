nellie Have you seen Darryl?
erin He's around here somewhere.
nellie Mmm.
erin Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
erin Nobody knows it yet, but darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
erin Darryl. Meet. bear. ull.
darryl How much did you pay for that?
erin Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
darryl Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
erin Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! That guy's hilarious. He's here today.
pam I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together. Oh my god! Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it. are those. are those butts? Huh? No way. No way!
angela Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
erin Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
angela No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
kevin Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping. 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation.
angela No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
oscar Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
angela What?
oscar He said he wanted me there for support.
angela I'm his! His. wife.
oscar Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. Me.
angela We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
jim Hey.
darryl Hey.
jim We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
darryl Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
jim And, as much as I miss pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
darryl jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
jim I'm couching it!
darryl Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
jim And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
darryl I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to soak. He hooked me up with a job.
pam Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
pam I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
jim Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
darryl Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
jim Who is this guy? We are killing it.
darryl Yes sir.
jim Yeah!
pam Conference room. Everybody. Now!
dwight You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
pam Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff. That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
dwight You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
pam Yeah.
dwight Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
pam I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
erin I thought that's what you were doing.
pam Yeah, but this is different.
erin Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
pam I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So.
erin I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
pam Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is. OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
meredith Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
creed Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
oscar Pam, what can be done?
pam Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.
oscar I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
pam What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
phyllis David Wallace called this meeting?
pam Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
pam No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
dwight Pam, I'll help you.
pam You will?
dwight If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
pam Thank you.
nellie I am in too, Pam.
pam Yeah?
nellie Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
pam Great.
pam I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
dwight You need my pitchfork?
angela Hey!
dwight What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
angela Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
dwight Ah, I'm not interested.
angela What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
dwight If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.
kevin Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
angela No.
kevin OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
angela Aw, crap.
dwight I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
frank You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there.
dwight Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
glenn I'm not drawing a butt.
nellie All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
dwight Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
val OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
dwight Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts.
nellie Well, this is getting us nowhere.
pam We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. Yeah. I think if we could get nate alone, we could crack him.
dwight We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. Nate. Your mother is dying.
pam See, I feel bad about that.
dwight It's all right. It's all right.
nate So, she's gonna pull through again? That's great. Can I talk to her?
dwight No. She needs her rest again.
nellie Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
dwight You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
nate Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt.
pam Tell us who defaced the mural!
nate He did it.
pam All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
dwight There's no gum. There never was any gum.
nate That's really rude.
kevin Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
oscar That painting is just. How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying? Party
announcer Ladies and gentlemen, senator and angela Lipton.
senator Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular.
angela Oh, Robert, you're horrible. Simon, Maxine. Who let you guys in here? Athlead
employee This is the team.
jim Nice job, man.
darryl You too. Darryl.
jim What? Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
darryl It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
jim Oh, um. Are you really mad about this?
darryl That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
jim Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
darryl No big deal. No big deal.
jim No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
darryl Nah, nah.
jim No big deal.
darryl Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
jim Honestly, I don't mind. Did you want me to wash it for you or.
darryl I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
jim OK. Here ya go.
darryl Thank you. . push;
nellie So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
pam Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
toby You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
frank I'm sorry I didn't like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny.
pam Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
frank Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours.
pam What was that?
frank You know what? You people can't fire me. So, screw you.
pam Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
toby Uh. it. compliment.
nellie The first 'sorry' sounded sincere.
toby There were two or three 'sorry's in there.
pam That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
dwight Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
pam We should just take him down.
dwight Wait. Are you saying.
pam I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
dwight Normally, I find pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, pam has kind of a good butt.
dwight He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
pam Yes!
dwight A little eye for an eye action.
pam Yes!
dwight Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
pam We need an infiltrator.
dwight I know just the man for the job.
pam Clark?
dwight He even looks like a mole.
oscar One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population. Party
guest You two seem very close.
senator Yes. We're good friends. Good friends.
oscar Yeah.
senator You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am. I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego. Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar. My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar.
oscar Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited. Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian. The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
darryl Oh, hey.
jim Hey.
darryl I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
jim Yeah. Totally.
darryl All right.
jim It's mine. Don't worry.
darryl I didn't say anything.
jim I don't think you had to.
darryl Excuse me?
jim I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
darryl What you need flour for, Jim?
jim That's not the point.
darryl What? You making bread?
jim No, I'm not making bread.
darryl What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
jim Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
darryl All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just. you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
jim It's all good. Are we all good?
darryl We good.
jim What's that cooler?
darryl Nothing. It's mine. What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
jim Oh, crap. Were those yours?
dwight I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
clark Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
dwight Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
clark OK, boss. Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
pam Shh, shh.
clark This is never gonna work.
pam Shh. Remember your lines.
clark What lines?
dwight Go move some paper!
pam Hey, you know that guy frank who works in the warehouse?
darryl He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
pam OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or.
darryl What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
pam Yeah, something like that.
darryl I know he loves his pick up truck.
pam Oh, great! His truck!
dwight Great. Get the plate number.
pam OK. Do you know the plate. never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
dwight So we know which truck to van.
darryl Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
pam Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. Come on. Party
photographer Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let's get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there.
angela He's blocking me.
senator It's only a photo, honey. Party
photographer Excuse me, uh, what's your name? Party
waiter Sean. Party
photographer LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way. Not you. No.
oscar He put me here.
angela He put you right in front of me? Party
photographer Let's just wheel Margaret right in front.
oscar Ow! Robert?!
senator Angela. Party
photographer Smile.
pam I'm done. What are you. Is that supposed to be my mural?
dwight Yeah. frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
pam Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.
dwight Let's see yours.
pam Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
dwight This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
pam Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
dwight I saw that. That's great!
pam Yeah. I feel better.
dwight Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
pam I know. You miss Angela, don't you?
dwight Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his pen1s.
pam I got back at frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very.
frank Lady! My truck? You had no right!
pam No, you had no right!
frank It's a $40, 000 truck!
pam So? You started it!
frank So? So someone need to shut you up!
brian Hey, hey, hey!
pam Whoa.
brian Easy!
frank You son of a bitch!
brian You're gonna hit a woman?
senator Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much. Well. Have we all calmed down yet?
oscar Yes. Sorry about that.
angela It was all my fault.
senator Let's all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you.
kevin Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
senator I beg your pardon.
kevin You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good.
pam Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
brian No. No, it's.
pam You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
brian It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's. I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
pam Forget about my mural. It's stupid.
brian No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
pam It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.
brian Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
pam Thanks, Brian.
brian Seeya.
jim Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
darryl Oh. Come on!
jim Oh. Oh!
darryl Damn!
jim You win. How good did that feel?
darryl That felt really good, actually.
