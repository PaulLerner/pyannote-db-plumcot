jim_halpert Hey.
jim_halpert Oh, what's this?
dwight_schrute That is a demerit.
jim_halpert "Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already.
dwight_schrute You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
jim_halpert Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
dwight_schrute Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
jim_halpert Lay it on me.
dwight_schrute Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
jim_halpert Now that sounds serious.
dwight_schrute Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
jim_halpert Which would be me.
dwight_schrute That is correct.
jim_halpert OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
dwight_schrute What's a dis... what's that?
jim_halpert Oh, you don't want to know.
pam_beesly Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
phyllis_vance I think I just got flashed.
pam_beesly What? Really?
phyllis_vance In the parking lot.
pam_beesly Oh, my God.
dwight_schrute Move!
jim_halpert OK, I'll call the real police.
andy_bernard What happened? What can I do to help?
jim_halpert OK.
andy_bernard I'll check the web.
jim_halpert Thank you. The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
pam_beesly Can you tell us what happened?
phyllis_vance Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
angela_martin Phyllis. You're a married woman.
creed_bratton The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
creed_bratton If that's flashing, then lock me up.
pam_beesly It's just, like, so creepy.
ryan_howard Yeah.
michael_scott What's happening?
pam_beesly Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
michael_scott Really? Is she OK?
pam_beesly Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
michael_scott OK. Phyllis, you say? Hmm.
angela_martin What is so funny?
michael_scott Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
kevin_malone I'm guessing not.
michael_scott I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
jim_halpert Mm... not really, no.
pam_beesly It's disgusting and demeaning.
michael_scott Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? OK. He's back! OK. Hmm. Waagh!
toby_flenderson Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
michael_scott What? Oh.
toby_flenderson What's going on?
michael_scott Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh...
toby_flenderson I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
michael_scott Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
toby_flenderson I don't think the women in this office -
michael_scott Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
toby_flenderson I was at a parent-teacher conference.
michael_scott Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your pen1s. I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
michael_scott In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.
jan_levinson Michael, ...
michael_scott Huh?
jan_levinson ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
michael_scott I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
jan_levinson I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
michael_scott Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
jan_levinson $300?
michael_scott I... uh, well, I don't know.
jan_levinson You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
hunter You got it, Jan.
dwight_schrute Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
michael_scott I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
dwight_schrute Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
michael_scott OK.
dwight_schrute There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
michael_scott This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Look at that one.
michael_scott Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid.
michael_scott Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
dwight_schrute Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his pen1s - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
jim_halpert Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
dwight_schrute Answer No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
pam_beesly Phallus?
dwight_schrute Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
pam_beesly I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
phyllis_vance I didn't really get a good look.
pam_beesly That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
karen_filippelli Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous.
dwight_schrute Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
karen_filippelli Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
dwight_schrute Desperate times call for desperate measures.
pam_beesly "Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors." Nobody dress like that.
michael_scott OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
karen_filippelli Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
michael_scott See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
dwight_schrute Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
michael_scott No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
jim_halpert Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
michael_scott Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
dwight_schrute Mm, less than three.
michael_scott That is not current.
dwight_schrute You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
jim_halpert Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
dwight_schrute Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
michael_scott You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
michael_scott I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
creed_bratton Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
michael_scott Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
meredith_palmer I don't remember doing that.
angela_martin What a surprise.
michael_scott OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
dwight_schrute Alien. Blagh!
michael_scott What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
andy_bernard If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
kevin_malone Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
karen_filippelli What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
michael_scott Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
karen_filippelli I'm saying that you're being sexist.
michael_scott No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
karen_filippelli That - it's the same thing.
phyllis_vance Michael.
michael_scott Yes.
phyllis_vance When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
michael_scott Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
angela_martin And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
michael_scott I have to know whether you're serious or not.
dwight_schrute I wish I could menstruate.
dwight_schrute If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
karen_filippelli Can we just get back to work?
michael_scott Ye - OK, yes.
angela_martin This is not work talk.
michael_scott You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.
karen_filippelli Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
angela_martin Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
michael_scott OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. Let's go!
dwight_schrute Have you finished with the sketch?
pam_beesly Yeah.
dwight_schrute Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
pam_beesly Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
dwight_schrute Hmm.
dwight_schrute I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
pam_beesly Oh.
angela_martin Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
meredith_palmer Thanks. I know how to drive.
pam_beesly Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.
meredith_palmer My car, my rules.
kevin_malone Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
jim_halpert No. Thank you, though.
kevin_malone You aren't curious?
jim_halpert Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
kevin_malone Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.
jim_halpert I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it.
kevin_malone Yeah. I'm going in.
jim_halpert Go crazy.
kevin_malone Oh... my... God.
andy_bernard I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
dwight_schrute Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
andy_bernard This guy looks like a real deviant.
dwight_schrute No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
andy_bernard Aye, aye, Cap'n.
dwight_schrute More like, "Aye, aye, General."
michael_scott I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it -
meredith_palmer It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
michael_scott Many women are competent drivers. OK. Come on.
dwight_schrute This is what we know.
jim_halpert Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
kevin_malone Yes.
toby_flenderson Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
jim_halpert Anna Maria's.
ryan_howard What's the occasion?
jim_halpert Six-month anniversary. What?
ryan_howard Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
jim_halpert No, we've been dating for six months.
ryan_howard Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
jim_halpert Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
ryan_howard I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
michael_scott All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
kelly_kapoor Thanks, Michael.
angela_martin Thank you, Michael.
michael_scott You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
pam_beesly What do you want to dish about?
michael_scott Anything you guys want. This is your time. Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese.
pam_beesly OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
kelly_kapoor Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
michael_scott What, um... what do you think of role-play?
phyllis_vance Oh, it can be fun.
michael_scott Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
karen_filippelli It's a pretty common one.
michael_scott I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
angela_martin OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
angela_martin Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
pam_beesly Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
michael_scott Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during s*x.
pam_beesly Oh, my God.
michael_scott And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
karen_filippelli That is not healthy behavior.
michael_scott No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
pam_beesly Michael, you need to get out of this.
michael_scott No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
pam_beesly No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad.
michael_scott No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?
pam_beesly Read the pros first.
michael_scott OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
phyllis_vance She does have very nice clothes.
karen_filippelli OK, OK. Um, cons.
michael_scott Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
pam_beesly What was the last one?
michael_scott She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
phyllis_vance No, the one before that.
michael_scott I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
pam_beesly Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
michael_scott I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having s*x.
karen_filippelli Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
michael_scott Yeah, that's smart.
pam_beesly Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
michael_scott That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
phyllis_vance I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
michael_scott I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
phyllis_vance My mom taught me that.
michael_scott Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
pam_beesly No one said it has no calories.
michael_scott Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. Come on. Get in here.
michael_scott Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
kevin_malone This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
toby_flenderson I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
creed_bratton What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
kevin_malone You're in here.
creed_bratton I pay for that privilege.
kevin_malone OK.
creed_bratton I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
michael_scott Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
karen_filippelli Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
phyllis_vance Jim's gonna love it.
pam_beesly I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
angela_martin Slower. Slower. Meredith. Slow it up.
michael_scott Oh. Oh, no. It's Jan. What do I do?
karen_filippelli Answer it.
pam_beesly Don't answer it.
michael_scott OK, it stopped.
kelly_kapoor Whoa.
meredith_palmer Crap.
jim_halpert That is pretty cool.
kelly_kapoor Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
michael_scott Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
pam_beesly Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
michael_scott Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. There we go! Good. Yes, we have the... all right.
pam_beesly I think I've got it.
michael_scott Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
pam_beesly I don't think we really need that, Michael.
michael_scott Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
pam_beesly You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. Coming!
andy_bernard Think we'll find him?
dwight_schrute Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
andy_bernard Halvsies?
dwight_schrute No. Wholesies.
andy_bernard Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
dwight_schrute Natch.
andy_bernard Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
dwight_schrute You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass.
michael_scott OK, I am really going to do this.
pam_beesly Good luck, Michael.
michael_scott You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it.
karen_filippelli OK, remember, be strong.
michael_scott I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail.
pam_beesly Don't leave a -
michael_scott Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
jan_levinson Michael... I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... I'm sorry.
michael_scott Thank you.
jan_levinson So... we're good?
michael_scott Abso-fruit-ly.
jan_levinson Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
michael_scott No... No...
jan_levinson One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
michael_scott Yeah.
jan_levinson OK. "It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want..."
michael_scott Maybe some Italian. "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -" Chinese? "who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy."
jan_levinson Oh.
michael_scott Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. "Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?" You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
dwight_schrute Dunder-Mifflin paper/s*x predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
dwight_schrute Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
jim_halpert No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
dwight_schrute Ugh. I'm hanging up.
jim_halpert Don't. I have information about the s*x predator.
dwight_schrute You have information about the s*x predator?
jim_halpert I saw him two minutes ago.
dwight_schrute Where?
jim_halpert In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
dwight_schrute Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. PAM!
