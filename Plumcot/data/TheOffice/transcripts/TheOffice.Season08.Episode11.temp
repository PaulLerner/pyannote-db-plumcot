kevin Oh yeah!
all Aw!
dwight Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
oscar You really have to say "oh yeah" every time you eat a candy bar?
kevin I can't help it, Oscar. It's just really good. Oh yeah!
jim all right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
andy It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
dwight You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
jim Okay, done.
erin Does anyone have a first aid kit?
darryl Check out this song I
wrote I'ma love you downstairs tonight.
jim all right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
andy Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?
jim You can write a book about chairs.
andy Books! Excellent, Jim.
oscar Andy, please! Please, just stop. You can do infinite things with paper-
andy Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper?
jim Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
andy I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!
angela Andy, you want us to buy our own paper?
andy Yes!
andy robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
dwight Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. all of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
dwight dwight Schrute for robert California!
receptionist Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all?
dwight I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
receptionist Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please have a seat.
gabe Dwight? What are you doing here?
dwight Gabe? You don't know?
gabe Course I know.
dwight Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
gabe Corporate says to me, "Gabe, we need you in Scranton. " Scranton says, "Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there. " So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
robert Dwight.
dwight Robert.
robert You made it.
dwight Yes.
robert Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly.
dwight Very good.
andy Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to "play ball. " Those were his words.
oscar Gosh, Andy, you had a great quarter. Okay? robert will understand. Eight hundred dollars is a rounding error!
andy So make that error!
oscar Andy, no-
kevin Hey! I can make that error.
oscar Aw.
andy Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.
kevin No, I-
andy It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. What do you say?
oscar I'm leaving early today because tonight I have a trivia contest in Philadelphia.
andy Oh.
oscar Any other crunch time, I would love to stay in, cook the books for you so you can save face in front of your CEO, but tonight is Triviocalypse!
andy What?
oscar It's only the biggest night of trivia of the year. There's a thousand dollar prize. I'm committed to my friends, they're committed to me.
andy You know what? Go. Have fun.
andy There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.
jim Stop right there. I love it.
darryl I'm in.
andy I didn't even say what it is.
darryl It's trivia.
jim In Philadelphia.
andy But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase.
jim That's a great idea.
darryl That's a great plan.
andy Yeah? You like it?
jim Yeah.
andy all right.
jim all right, good stuff.
andy I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, "this sounds really stupid. "
darryl You just made a good idea, a great idea.
andy There is one problem with this plan.
darryl What?
andy We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.
gabe You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. all right.
dwight Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
gabe Yeah. But not just bagels. all unwanted problems.
question What's the most important appliance in your house?
dwight Meat grinder.
gabe Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
dwight You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
robert Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
dwight But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
robert No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight.
gabe CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
dwight Still an important position. Still a chief.
gabe You're really going to like Bill. He, uh, he has me toilet a lot of people for him. Hallway phone, gabe Lewis speaking.
robert Gabe, listen to me. Don't bother Bill with this. He has to go put out a fire on the home front. Just wait twenty minutes and then I want you to listen to Dwight's pitch. Make him feel valued. Make him feel heard.
gabe Your wish is my command.
robert It's a command.
oscar I don't believe this. What are you doing here, Andy?
andy You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.
oscar What? No!
andy I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.
oscar And you guys thought this was a good idea?
jim I thought it was a fun idea.
darryl There were times on the two and a half hour drive when I experienced doubt. That's the thing about long drives, you know, you're always going to- this is a gay bar.
andy Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?
oscar Yes! It's a gay bar! So you guys want to go home now?
all No. Nah.
oscar What does this say about you? That you followed me here? That you think you're going to win your sales quota? At a gay bar's trivia night?
andy It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. Not anything.
oscar Good luck.
andy Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.
meredith Good-timers follow me.
phyllis Backups.
stanley Go on, kid. You know you don't belong here.
andy A-team.
jim Okay.
andy all right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except.
kevin Okay.
jim There's a table over here. . push;
host all right, first question
everyone Ray Charles famously had this state on his mind. What is its capital?
andy Oh, we got this!
creed Let's reverse engineer this. You're a black singer. Where do you go? Somewhere where you're a novelty. Alaska?
stanley Atlanta.
phyllis Oh I know you think that, because that's where the Olympics were held.
cathy My cousins were actually at those Olympics.
stanley Keep talking all you want.
kevin How am I supposed to know what was on his mind? Ooh, what do blind people think about?
erin Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes, stairs, piano, darkness.
host Okay, time's up. Let's get the boards up. "Atlanta, Georgia" is the correct answer.
gabe Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
dwight There's no fires within eight miles of here.
gabe Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
dwight What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
receptionist This must be very frustrating.
gabe I can see you in the jungle now.
host Okay, now, you're not an all-star of the NBA, but you did get your game on when you won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in 2011. Who are you?
andy Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.
jim Shawn Marion.
darryl Yes, Shawn Marion.
ryan That doesn't sound right. I want to say, LaDameon Washington.
jim Wrong, for so many reasons.
phyllis Well, I know Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man was Richard Burton. Is that helpful?
stanley That's it. I'm going to go watch the boats on the river.
kevin Ron Artest, Kelly.
kelly No, it's Lamar Odom. If it'd been Ron Artest, it would have come up in Dancing with the Stars, when they pan over his trophy case when he's at home with his family. Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big storyline on Chloe and Lamar.
host all right, boards up. Let's see who got it. "Lamar Odom" is what we were looking for. "Lamar Odom" Thank you.
jim Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
kevin Nicely done!
andy You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.
darryl Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
dwight So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
receptionist Well, you got my vote.
dwight Oh my God.
gabe I know.
dwight Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
gabe What?
dwight What's with the smile?
gabe You're doing great. You know, so good.
dwight And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
gabe Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! Ow!
dwight Take me to Robert.
gabe Ow! He went home.
dwight Take me to his house.
gabe Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
dwight You know where it is. Lead me there.
gabe Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!
dwight Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
host Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team? Excuse me, sir?
ryan Yeah?
host I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account. but you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules.
ryan Okay, I'm turning it off.
host Okay, you're not turning it off.
ryan I won't look at it.
host Sir?
ryan I can't- I can't not touch it.
host Okay, then we're going to have to take it away. Thank you.
ryan Look, I can't, I can't not have my phone. I'm sorry. I want to be with my phone.
host all right, guys. After nine rounds, let's check the scores. In first place, with nine points, it's Aesop's Foibles. The Queerenstein bears have seven points. Dunder-Mifflin A-Team has four points.
jim all right.
host D. M. Backup Team has three points. The Einsteins have eight points. Ladies Gaga have five points.
andy So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
dwight Which one is it?
gabe I don't know. all I know is the building.
dwight Robert! robert California! Robert!
robert Dwight! How nice of gabe to show you where I live. Come around. 102.
host all right guys, time's up. Who was the relatively unknown patent clerk who discovered that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared? Looks like everyone gets a point for Albert Einstein. Oh wait. Except for the Einsteins. That's all right. Which means the top three teams are going to finish it off in the speed round. So let's get everyone some bells. In third place we have the Einsteins.
kevin Oh yeah!
kelly What!
host In second place, we have the Queerenstein Bears. Queerenstein
bears Whoo! Let's go!
host And, in first place, is Aesop's Foibles. Oscar's
friend Whoo!
darryl Yeah, we're going to get clobbered.
host Ring it in when you know it. First
question This man had a fatwa declared on him when- Einsteins?
meredith What?
erin What is it?
meredith What?
erin I did my part, babe. I'm just the bell girl.
host Aesop's?
oscar Salman Rushdie.
host Salman Rushdie is correct. Heading out to sea, sailors. On a square-rigged ship, the sale set furthest forward is called what?
meredith Princess Ding-Dong, do not hit that bell unless-
erin Flying jib.
host Flying jib is correct for the Einsteins.
robert Shalom. Give us just a minute. stu and I are just finishing up our lesson. Trust me. One nine-minute bout is a cardiovascular equivalent of running uphill for three hours. I could go to the gym three times a week or I can wrestle stu once a month.
stu Grab my knee!
gabe Yay Robert!
robert Guys, please help yourself to some drinks from the fridge.
host According to a recent survey, this is the most common learning disability among American adolescents. Oscar's
friend Boom! ADHD!
host No.
meredith Wrong. The answer is dyslexia!
host That's correct for the Einsteins.
andy Whoo! Yeah!
host Sir-
andy Go Einsteins!
host Dial it back, this isn't Tail Feathers, okay?
robert They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?
dwight No thank you.
robert Sit down, Dwight.
dwight Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a
riddle A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, "table for one?" How is this possible?
robert You were dining alone? all those people are you?
dwight Yes, exactly. Riddle number
two Who is going-
robert Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's
basement It's wet, it's filled with mold, strange insects, alligators. Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight. You know that, right?
dwight N. it's complicated.
robert This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better?
dwight It's a job interview, not a flea market.
robert Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.
dwight Yes.
host Final round. Last two teams squaring off. I hope you're ready to play doctor. Our question is about health and the human body.
andy Oh, come on!
host The standard American analog scale has a maximum capacity of what weight?
kevin Three hundred pounds!
host Point for the Einsteins. Here's your final question. Cinephiles, put on your memory
berets This 2001 masterpiece from Gilles Paquet-Brenner explores the intricate dynamics of a family in disarray.
oscar Le titre du film est Le Scaphandre et le Papillon. Oscar's
friend Yes!
host I'm sorry, no. Over to the Einsteins.
kevin Les Jolies Choses.
meredith Are you sure?
kevin Marie Cotillard exposes herself a number of times in that film.
host The Einsteins win it!
oscar No! Come on!
kevin Look, I know it's easy to say tonight was just a fluke, and maybe it was, but here's a piece of
trivia a fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea. So if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are, you just might catch one. Stonewall
