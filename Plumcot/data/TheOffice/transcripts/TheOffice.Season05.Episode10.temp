oscar Here are our final actual costs for this year.
michael Mmm. okay.
oscar As you can see, we did pretty well, so.
michael Yes. Yes, I can see. that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
oscar Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis.
michael Yes.
oscar Right there.
michael There's the x-ax. icks.
oscar You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
michael Mmhmm, okay.
oscar But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
michael Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
oscar Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
michael Ho-oh!
oscar So you have an extra dollar.
michael Yeah.
oscar So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer.
michael I'll be six.
oscar And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
michael So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
oscar We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
michael Whoo.
oscar We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
michael Okay, break it down in terms of, um. okay, I-I think I'm getting you.
michael Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please. Can anybody guess?
pam New chairs?
michael No, a new copier! Unless everybody can agree on something better?
oscar No, no, please. Please do not do this.
pam Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
michael So. we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
pam Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good.
oscar Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
pam Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
oscar Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
pam Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
michael Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
stanley I'm with Pam. Chairs.
michael Alright, so, teams forming.
toby We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
michael You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
toby You'll see.
pam Michael?
michael Yes.
pam I've talked to Meredith, stanley and jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
jim Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
pam What? Jim.
jim Ever since pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
meredith Jim, good for you, standing up to pam like that.
creed The balls on you, man.
oscar So Michael, what do you think?
michael Why me?
jim You have to make the decision.
michael Wow, okay. Well. I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
andy Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms.
dwight Yeah, do tell.
andy I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left. "
dwight Mmhmm.
andy "Walk until you hear the beehive. "
dwight How could it be more clear?
angela I think andy makes an excellent point.
dwight Okay.
angela But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
dwight We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
angela Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
dwight Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
andy Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
andy We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
pam Hey.
jim Hey.
pam So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing.
jim Mmhmm.
pam I really think you should reconsider.
jim Oh, Pam, I really. hate that copier.
pam Yeah, I know.
jim Yeah.
pam But I really think you should reconsider.
jim Beesly, are you threatening me?
pam Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground . All right.
jim Okay.
jim Whew.
dwight This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
andy Hmm. mm, what's that smell?
dwight You're gonna need to be more specific.
angela Manure. Get rid of it.
dwight Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
angela Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
dwight You wanna eat, don't you?
angela Honey, say something!
andy Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
dwight . I'll consider it.
andy See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. . Darn! Heh.
dwight There's a hose out back.
andy Okay.
pam Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
michael Yes.
pam Well that never happened.
oscar Michael?
michael I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
oscar I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
michael Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
jim Woah, you guys going to lunch?
michael Yes.
jim Mind if I join?
michael Ohh, God!
jim All right.
michael Yeah!
jim Let's go.
michael Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
jim Let's do it.
michael All right! Cool!
jim Where we going?
michael I have no idea.
pam So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. It is so on.
pam Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
oscar Stop it! Michael.
jim Michael, that is hilarious.
michael Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
oscar The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael.
jim Ahh. I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
pam Aww.
jim Yeah.
pam That's cool. Mm, good stuff.
jim You look really pretty.
pam Thank you.
michael Yeah.
pam Michael?
michael Yeah?
pam Hey!
michael Oh, hey.
pam You got a second?
michael I do.
pam Oh, good.
pam Oh, that must've been so fun.
michael it was fun. We had a good time.
pam Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
michael Oh, thank you.
pam Yeah, is that a new tie?
michael Um, no, not. no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
pam That is amazing!
michael You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
pam What?
michael Nine dollars. The boys' department.
pam No.
michael Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
pam No way!
michael Look at that. Unh. Unh-unh.
pam Yeah! Oh, so I guess oscar and jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
michael Yes they were.
pam Yeah.
michael They were.
pam Here's what I was
thinking everyone sits on a chair every day.
michael Mmhmm.
pam But not everyone.
michael Sits on a copier.
pam Or even uses the copier every day.
michael Yeah.
pam Yeah, right?
michael Very valid.
pam . That's it.
michael All right.
pam All right, see you later.
michael See ya.
pam Hot tie guy.
michael Hahaha!. well. . push;
dwight Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
angela No. I haven't thought of it.
dwight Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
angela I would like cat.
dwight Cats don't make butter.
angela I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
dwight It doesn't make any sense.
angela Yes it does!
andy Okay, guys!
angela I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
dwight Cow, goat or sheep.
andy What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
jim You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
pam No, copier's great.
jim Yeah?
pam Yeah. I have my copies.
jim There they are.
pam And I have my original.
jim You got it.
pam So suck it.
jim Okay.
michael Okay.
kevin Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
michael Oh, thank you my dear.
kelly Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
michael Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay.
stanley There he is!
michael There he is! Hello, hello!
phyllis Hello.
michael Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
jim Oh!
michael Mm! Yeah!
pam There's that ass!
michael Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
pam Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!
michael Oh. ah, I almost choked.
dwight Here's another place.
angela It's beautiful.
andy Hey-o!
dwight So. why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
andy 
angela Hello, I'm angela Martin, and-
andy I'm Andy.
angela I work with Dwight.
dwight He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
andy What?
dwight Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad. And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah. Then he's gonna have andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh. just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do. " And then he's going to ask angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply.
angela I do.
dwight And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
hank Got a call about a problem up here.
pam Did somebody call Hank?
michael Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
hank So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.
michael Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. Yeah, take as many as you want.
hank Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here.
michael Yes.
hank So what are we talking about?
michael Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
hank I know what a surplus is.
michael Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
hank Is that the copier?
michael It is, yes.
hank Hmm.
michael What?
hank I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
michael Okay.
pam You can try mine.
michael Oh, there we go.
hank Hmm, not much lumbar support.
michael Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
hank On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.
michael So, the copier.
hank Well, let me finish.
michael All right, yes.
hank Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
michael Well, what should I do?
hank . Let me see the copier again.
michael All right, get out. Get out.
angela Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister. it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
dwight I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
angela What do you mean?
dwight Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do. " And I said, "I do. " And andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
angela Dwight! That doesn't count!
dwight Yes, of course it does.
angela No, it doesn't!
dwight It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
angela I didn't-
dwight Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
angela We are not married.
dwight Wha.
angela Take this thing.
dwight My. It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
andy Are we, uh. are we leaving or what? Ow!
david Michael.
michael Hey David- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
david Is this why you're calling me?
michael No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- I'm sorry.
david Okay.
michael Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
david You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
michael No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
david Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
michael The what now?
david Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
michael . Like a tip? $645?!
michael I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
jim We have that going out Tuesday. Okay? Sure, no, I can. I'll double-check that for you.
michael All right, attention everyone.
jim Let me call you right back. Okay.
michael I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier. is. working perfectly.
oscar That's the original.
michael Pam, would you stand up for a sec? Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct. it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers? They don't have copiers. They don't even- Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I
this I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
oscar Do you know?
michael Do I know what?
oscar I think you know.
michael Mm, no.
phyllis Know what?
pam Yeah, know what?
oscar Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
michael $645.
kevin Michael's a genius.
michael Right.
oscar Why'd you say dollars?
michael Because that is how my mind works.
oscar What's 15% of 200? Thank you. Everyone, michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
jim Wait, what?
pam You can do that?
kevin Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5, 912?
michael Let's see.
pam You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
michael I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
oscar You're gonna get us a copier then?
michael This is so stupid.
pam Or chairs?
michael This is so, so stupid. And, God. that's my phone.
stanley I didn't hear a phone.
michael To be continued!
michael No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
andy Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. What-
angela Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
andy Was that hot or what?
pam So what's it gonna be?
oscar Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
pam Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
oscar You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
michael You think it's easy?
stanley It's your job.
michael Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
michael It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- Hey.
pam Hey.
oscar Hey, we're going with the chairs.
michael What?
oscar I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
pam Thanks Michael.
michael Good work. I'm proud of you. Mother-
michael What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
jim Truce?
pam Yeah, I guess, since I won.
jim Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. Totally kidding. I'm gonna need four.
