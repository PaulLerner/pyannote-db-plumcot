dwight Last week I gave a fire safety talk. And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. Today, smoking is gonna save lives.
dwight Does anyone smell anything smoky?
angela Did you bring your jerky in again?
dwight 
pam Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
phyllis What--
andy Whoa, fire!
dwight Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people?
pam The phones are dead.
dwight Oh, how did that happen?
kevin It's out in the hall.
dwight No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
michael Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm.
dwight What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
michael Stay calm!
dwight Wait, wait, wait.
michael Everyone, now calm down!
dwight No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
michael What does warm mean?
everyone Oh my God.
dwight Not a viable option.
pam Try a different door.
dwight Okay, what's next?
michael Don't run.
dwight Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle?
andy It-- it's warm.
dwight Well, uh, another option.
jim Back door.
dwight Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!
phyllis Oh! I forgot my purse.
stanley Leave it woman!
michael Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
dwight Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can.
oscar Ah! My hand! That's hot!
andy Aah! This ones hot too!
michael Okay, we're trapped. everyone for himself.
dwight Okay, let's go.
everyone Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way!
dwight Calm, please
andy Get out of the way!
dwight Have you ever seen a burn victim?
andy Move it!
dwight Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
angela It's okay. Shh shhh.
dwight A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people.
angela Oscar.
dwight What's next?
angela Oscar!
oscar Stay alive! I'm getting help!
angela Pull me up!
oscar You're too heavy!
angela I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit! Oh!
dwight How about 911? Anyone? 911.
pam What do we do?
dwight Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
jim Okay, I am not dying here. Come on.
angela What is that? What is that?
andy The fire's shooting at us!
phyllis What in the name of God is going on?!
andy Yes! Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram! phyllis and
creed Ahhhh!!!
andy Go, go, go, go, go!!
michael Help!! Help!!
stanley I'm about to die!
dwight Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.
jim What?!
dwight Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise. So, what have we learned? Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
michael No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
jim No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
michael He's going to swallow is tongue.
jim No. Michael. Michael.
michael Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.
jim Michael! Michael!
michael Leave me al--
andy You're choking him!
michael Saving him! david
wallace How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
dwight A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
michael Electricity.
dwight Shampoo. david
wallace You could have burned down the whole building.
dwight I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
lawyer Did you shout, "Fire!", causing a panic?
dwight Yes I shouted "fire!". I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
michael Hed. Hedded
dwight When no one hedded--
michael Take hedded of.
dwight N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
michael Heed. Heed.
dwight So, you--
michael Take heed of.
dwight And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
michael Take heed of.
dwight Hee-heeding this right now.
lawyer Wh--what?
michael Okay. This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. david
wallace No, we are mad.
michael Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide. david
wallace No, we're not.
michael I am not a mind reader, David.
david Look, this is very serious offense. We have cause to fire you.
michel Can you shove down? Instead. shove down, please. Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.
dwight No.
michael And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that dwight doesn't like.
dwight PETA. david
wallace Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack. He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run. Do you want that on your conscious?
michael Do you? david
wallace Michael?
michael You talking to me? david
wallace Yeah.
michael What?
dwight Well. I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
michael No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.
dwight Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay?
michael Yeah.
dwight I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
michael That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
dwight What? You?
michael Yes.
dwight Come on.
michael I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.
dwight That's preposterous.
michael No, I will.
michael Nobody should have to go to work thinking, "Oh, this is the place that I might die today. " That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to. An office is a place where dreams come true.
michael Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. Welcome back, Stanley.
stanley Thank you, Michael.
stanley It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people.
stanley Not maybe. Yes or no.
stanley No way. Uh-uh.
stanley Are you from another planet?
stanley Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
stanley Did I stutter?
stanley I'm done. Goodbye.
stanley But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
michael Andy.
andy A throne for your highness.
stanley I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
michael No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
stanley I'm going to die. CPR
trainer A-B-C. Okay? And hat stands for. airway, breathing and circulation.
michael Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing. "
dwight This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
michael Shut it. Shut it.
michael We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when stanley had his. when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
kevin I can't keep doing this forever. CPR
trainer It's been 20 seconds.
kevin Call it. CPR
trainer Would you like to try next?
dwight Absolutely I would not.
michael You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
stanley Oh, I don't know.
phyllis That's not a good idea, Michael.
michael Come on.
phyllis He needs to rest.
michael No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
stanley I would die.
michael And you're okay with that?
stanley I'm okay with the logic of it.
michael Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this.
stanley Yes. I had a heart attack. I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire. I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
michael Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it!
angela Michael!
michael This is you we're talking about.
angela Michael.
michael Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go. Stanley. All right. CPR
trainer So, assessing the situation. Are they breathing?
michael No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs.
rose No, that's not part of it.
michael Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
kevin I would want to live with no legs.
michael How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
rose All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute .
michael okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?
jim How's that gonna help you?
michael I will divide and then count to it.
jim Right.
rose Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees. Do you know that song?
michael Yes, yes I do. I love that song. First I was afraid, I was petrified.
rose No, it's--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
michael Okay, I got it.
creed You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
michael Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
michael Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah.
andy Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, you can look the other way. Loo do do!
rose Okay!
andy Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
rose Okay!
everyone Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
rose Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.
dwight Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
rose I have no idea.
dwight Anyone else?
phyllis We bury him?
dwight Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
creed He has no wallet, I checked.
michael He is an organ donor.
dwight He is.
michael Yeah.
dwight Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. Here we go.
angela Oh my God! Dwight!
kelly Dwight!
angela What are you-- What are you doing?
dwight We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
stanley I'm not feeling well. I need to sit down.
michael Hey, Stanley.
andy Stanley.
michael Are you okay?
angela Oh my God!
stanley Oh my God!
angela Dwight!
dwight Clarice?
stanley Oh my God! david
wallace Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
dwight I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic. david
wallace We had to pay for it. Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
michael Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
dwight Wow.
michael Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
andy Hope you brought your appetitos. My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. Uh, damn it. This movie, a lot of buzz. Not coming out for another six months. Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges. . push;
pam We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people.
jim And we don't know how.
pam But andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
jim Punishment fits the crime. Jessica
alba I want you to meet my nana. Nana.
lily Mmmhmm. Jessica
alba This is Sam.
sam Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
lily Please-- Call me Lily. Let's play Bridge. You can be my partner.
sam Alright. Lily.
jim What's going on?
jim Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
pam My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and. it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
pam He's not saying what he needs to say.
andy Hmm? Who? Sam?
pam Yeah.
jim I mean, they just need to communicate, you know? If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
andy Hmm.
andy jim and pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
michael Hi, everyone. Corporate has given dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
dwight I have.
michael Let's hear it.
dwight "I state my regret. "
jim You couldn't of memorized that?
dwight I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
phyllis It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
dwight Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!
pam Hi dad. Yeah jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
lily I'm in here.
sam I uh, I'm sorry I didn't uh, realize you were in a bath. Do you want me to go?
lily I want you to stay.
jim Gimme a break.
andy I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
sam Get that in there. Oh yeah.
lily Get that done already.
sam I know but if I get it in deeper.
jim Can you believe this? He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
andy Yeah. but. eh. breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
pam So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
andy You guys, they're making out.
pam Hey.
jim Hey.
pam Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
jim Mmm. nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
pam 
jim What?
pam I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
jim Mmm.
pam You're good to talk to.
jim I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um.
michael Ohmmm. Ohmmm. Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm. ohmmm.
michael My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. That one makes me think. of death. It's kinda nice.
michael It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
jim Don't open your eyes.
pam What? Oh.
michael And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
meredith Chunky monkey.
michael Too expensive.
stanley Chocolate.
michael Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
stanley It's my bio-feedback machine.
michael Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
stanley It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
michael You have stress?
stanley Yes.
michael During our relaxation exercise?
phyllis Let me get you some water.
michael No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
stanley No, Michael, No.
michael Let me getcha.
stanley Would ya, would ya step back please
michael Ok, alright.
stanley Please. A little further.
michael Ok.
stanley That's better.
michael Ok. I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh. Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? Let's give this a shot.
michael Hellloo.
kevin Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
michael So. it wasn't dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer. it's uh. great twist. Great twist.
pam Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
pam What did you say to my dad?
jim What?
pam After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
jim Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again.
jim Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so. it was her parents or my parents.
pam What could jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
michael I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
dwight Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
michael Oh.
dwight Speaking of which.
michael Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man. Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
michael Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short.
kelly A vacation.
michael What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other.
oscar michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
michael Si senor.
oscar That's offensive.
michael It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer. fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
kevin Oh my GOD. Oh man. Ohhhhh my God.
oscar I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
michael I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
dwight May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
phyllis Hey, this is your apology letter.
dwight That was the last signature I needed.
michael Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and. ah. whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. Ok. lower the mic for the midget.
angela If you ever wondered if you were michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be michael Scott.
angela I normally don't enjoy making people laugh.
angela If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be.
group michael Scott!
michael Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
kelly I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
michael You're so lucky! Good one.
meredith Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said "Gross".
michael Well.
meredith Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
michael Pow pow pow.
oscar 
michael NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY.
jim Several times a day, michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
michael I know where this is goin'.
jim Do ya?
michael No.
jim Ok. Remember Spider face?
michael No.
jim OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
michael Spite her - ok
jim Yeah. yep.
dwight How dare you all attack him like this.
michael Oh, stop it Dwight.
dwight michael is your superior.
michael No no no no no no!
dwight Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
michael dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
dwight Ok, no, they don't understand who they have.
michael That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
dwight You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
michael Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
dwight Are you calling me an idiot?
michael Idiot.
dwight Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land.
pam Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is michael Scott. He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
michael Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
pam Well, ya know, michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!
michael Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
darryl Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
michael We are, we are a family.
darryl Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
michael Oh very funny.
darryl What's his name?
michael Uhh. hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
darryl Roy left years ago. What's his name?
michael I don't believe I have had the pleasure. Warehouse
michael michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic.
darryl What's his name?
michael Jefferson.
darryl Nope. His name is Michael.
andy What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, michael Scott.
michael Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so. get your facts straight. So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought sorry. I think I have a frog in my throat. Um. I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up phyllis and Kevin. Uh um.
pam Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
dwight It's very unusual for michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
kevin He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&amp;Ms in alphabetical order.
oscar Alright Kevin. Enough with the michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
kevin I'm almost done.
oscar That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.
dwight Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
jim Yep. You're being replaced.
pam I think he meant personal day.
dwight Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
phyllis I hope he's ok, I feel bad.
creed Give it up, he's dead.
jim He just sent a text.
creed What's a text?
michael Caw. caw. caw caw. caw.
michael You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. I'm okay. No, I'm not.
pam phyllis there's a package for you.
phyllis Oh, ok.
dwight Got it.
lily Sam, sam Sam. It's not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, it's that you lied to me. Can't you see that? Can't you see? Oh, I can never trust you.
sam Lilly no. Lilly! Lilly please! Lilly STOP! I don't care how much time we have left. I don't care what my friends say! And I don't care what your mom thinks! Frankly I'm pretty sure she's not makin any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment. Lilly. I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. Lilly. Lilly! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button!
andy Sam! Sam!
pam Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
jim So what did he say? Was it my fault?
pam Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
jim You ok?
pam Yeah.
pam When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.
andy I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm. maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
pam Michael! It's really good to see you.
dwight Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
jim Are you alright?
oscar Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday.
michael I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
pam What?
michael Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. angela where's Angela? Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during s*x and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are. Oscar, you're gay.
oscar Wow.
michael Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe.
michael They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should. better hold onto them pills, just in case.
