gabe The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
kelly Oh my God, kill me!
andy Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, gabe go ahead. It's okay.
gabe Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so. Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
pam I'm gonna do it.
gabe And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
pam Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
jim Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
pam I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
pam
 I'm going into labor!
phyllis Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
pam I'm going into labor!
ryan Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
pam I'm going into labor.
pam Here we go!
andy Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. everyone knows you're full of it.
kelly Yeah.
oscar It's not fair, you guys.
kelly Pitiful.
meredith It's stupid.
andy Never cry wolf.
jim Okay.
pam Okay.
erin Oh.
pam Oh! Oh!
everyone Oh! Oh my goodness!
jim Oh my God!
pam I'm really in labor! This is happening!
jim Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
pam Oh!
jim How do you feel?
erin Drive carefully!
oscar Good luck!
everyone Goodbye! Good luck!
pam False alarm.
andy What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
andy I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
andy Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
erin It's right here in PA.
andy Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
angela Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
andy That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
dwight Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
oscar Actually it is the northernmost.
dwight Ha!
dwight The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
andy Charge!
phyllis Well, this could be fun. I-
andy Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
ryan What's the halal option?
andy Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
ryan Out.
andy You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But. who's coming with me?
erin I'm in.
phyllis I'm in too.
dwight Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
andy Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
kevin Yes!
andy One for you.
erin Cool. Thanks.
andy And one for you.
jim Cool. Thanks.
andy And- oh. You missed your head. There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
andy All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
darryl You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
phyllis Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
andy It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.
everyone Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! Limitless!
andy All right, all right, all right.
kevin Not food and stuff.
pam Here. Like it?
kevin Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
pam I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
kevin The fire pit is a no-brainer.
robert Oh, hi there.
pam Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
robert Where is everyone? Where is Andy?
kelly andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
robert Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here. is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office.
ryan Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
robert So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! Excited!
kevin Okay.
andy You guys.
darryl J-j-j-ju.
andy Get excited!
darryl Shh! Movie's almost over.
andy All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.
gabe Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The man with Many Capabilities. '
andy Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
darryl I got Source Code on the way back.
everyone Ooh! All right!
andy Woo!
andy Whoa, where you going?
jim Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
andy Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.
jim No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
phyllis Yeah, sign says "Begin tour here. "
andy Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched andy Bernard tour.
andy After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
erin Yeah, but I'm confused.
dwight Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D. P. A, that's deaths per acre.
erin Mm-hmm.
dwight . nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
erin Oh. D. P. A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
dwight Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
oscar Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
dwight The truth.
oscar Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
erin Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
dwight No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
erin Interesting.
dwight Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
oscar Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
dwight Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
oscar he's a historian.
dwight Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
oscar Yes, yes, yes!
dwight Not by a long shot!
erin No!
oscar Yes!
dwight No, it was not!
oscar Argh!
dwight No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
oscar What?
dwight Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
oscar Erin-
dwight Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
erin Get out of here! . push;
robert I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?
ryan May I go first?
robert Absolutely.
ryan Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With. origami. It's the sushi of paper.
robert This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?
ryan Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
robert That was bad.
stanley If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr. ' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
robert The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with.
stanley In the African-American community-
robert No.
stanley Thought it was worth a try.
darryl That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought? Park
ranger Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most-
dwight Excuse me, I got a question for you. Park
ranger Sure.
dwight Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms? Park
ranger Uh, I haven't heard of that one.
dwight Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
oscar I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
andy We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
chelsea Are you Lincoln?
gabe No, no, I'm-
gabe Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools. I don't see it. Chelsea's
mom Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
gabe Okay, Quick.
man Hey! Lincoln's starting.
gabe Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny.
pam Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us. and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
robert I am not.
pam Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
pam At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
robert Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is.
kevin Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So.
robert Cookies. Cookie placement.
kevin Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance. '
robert Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? There you go. Consensus.
ryan Okay, we are now on a planet where kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
gabe I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet. happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
audience No!
kevin 'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that. like, forget it.
robert Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?
stanley how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
robert That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic.
kevin Thank you.
jim By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
andy Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
jim Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
andy Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
darryl Hunger for hamburger.
erin Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
darryl That's good.
andy Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
jim Only two hundred dollars?
andy We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.
darryl Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
andy Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
andy Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
jim Oh wow. So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
andy Its. I mean come on.
phyllis I don't think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus.
andy Alright fine. You know what – I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me.
dwight You said you weren't going to look back.
robert And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?
kevin I don't know.
robert Right. I mean you're an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
kevin Yes. I am an accountant.
oscar dwight – this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.
dwight Really?
oscar Yeah.
dwight Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
archivist Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War.
oscar You've heard about it?
dwight YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.
archivist There you go.
narrator Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front.
soldier Dearest mother I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris.
dwight Hallowed ground.
narrator But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all. It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war.
amanda You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers – these kind of men preferred peace to war. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive. and well. fabulous.
oscar Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.
dwight I've seen enough.
oscar You're right. There should be a monument to this.
kevin Never trust a cookie with a woman's name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They'll just break your heart.
robert Kevin!
ryan robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea.
kevin What?!? No!
robert Big Mac idea. That sounds encouraging.
ryan It's really, really good Robert. Let me explain.
kevin No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me.
robert Well what is the idea?
kevin Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
ryan You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. That is 100 percent your idea.
robert Oh my. It was just actually cookies the whole time?
andy Dammit.
darryl Hey.
andy You guys came. Where's everyone else?
darryl Back at the bus. We were locked out. phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
andy Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders.
jim Yeah sorry everyone else didn't come. I think they're just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.
andy Even without an audience you're still at it.
jim What are you talking about?
andy Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That's what you did with this trip.
jim andy – this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It's just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you're our regional manager. And guess what man? You don't have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head. I'm wearing a very pink hat. I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure "DM does GB" means something kinda sexual. But guess who's wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That's huge.
andy You don't like the hats?
jim They're terrible.
darryl I hate myself.
andy They just didn't turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
andy The world will little note, nor long remember the fight jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that's good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and I'm their manager. Yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
gabe Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. Oh Mary this is wonderful. Ok Mary stop your scolding. I'll be quiet. I need her like I need a hole in the head! BANG! Ooh
