pam The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
kevin Oh, yeah! Can I spin first?
pam Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and. you see what chore you get that day.
kevin A wheel is supposed to spin.
erin Yeah, you know, like guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh, guh. guh.
pam No, I'm familiar with spinning. It's just that wouldn't work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-
andy Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.
creed A wheel wants to spin, Pam.
jim Spinning would be more fun.
pam ‘Kay.
kevin Okay, that's what I'm talking about! Big money, big money! Mug duty?
pam Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.
kevin This sucks.
erin Yeah, seriously, it's like everything on there is work.
pam I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. It's-
kevin Yeah, I don't think that you understand wheels.
pam I've been through several rounds of development with the team and here's where we stand with the chore wheel. We've got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it's more fun this way.
pam The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It's so cute no one seems to mind.
pam Toilets!
jim Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma's got breakfast, OK? We are going to Roy's wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife's ex-fiancé's wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it's your wife's ex-fiancé.
pam Thanks, mom!
jim A banana?
pam Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs.
jim Oh, come on. Not even roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
pam Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.
jim Just. so weird.
erin Oh, Pete, you've got mail.
pete Really? I got something?
erin Well, it's addressed to Customer Service so, it's your mail.
clark Well, you know, I'm also Customer Service.
erin Yeah, I'm alternating.
pete Yay, another person yelling at me.
erin Well, it could be a nice letter. I write nice letters to companies all the time.
pete That's really nice.
clark Wow, Newsweek, huh? This election. thing is crazy, right?
pete It's open.
erin Oh yeah, I accidentally read it. It's not a nice letter.
pete OK.
nellie Get excited. The special projects fairy has arrived.
creed I know you don't really exist.
nellie Today, I launch my big charity initiative ‘Operation Give Back'. andy has shot down all of my special projects thus far but, this one is about charity. So, I'd like to see him piss on that one.
roy Darryl! Ha-ha! What's happening?
darryl Congratulations, baby!
roy Ah, thank you!
jim Is this his house?
pam Think so.
server Mimosa?
pam Thank you.
server Would you like me to take your peel?
pam Yes, thank you.
jim OK.
pam Who's that?
jim Uh, my ex-fiancé.
pam Ha-ha.
jim I started a new business with my college friend. But, pam doesn't know. Um. actually I did tell pam and we decided ‘no'. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I'm thinking there's another conversation coming. And, it's hard to know when that will be.
nellie With Operation Give Back, you pick the charities Dunder-Mifflin supports.
kevin Oh boy! What's happening?
nellie There's four thousand dollars to give away. So, who has filled out their form? Stanley?
stanley American Diabetes Association.
angela Um, you have diabetes, Stanley. I'm sorry, is the assignment to pick a selfish charity?
toby I w-, uh, I would love to give uh-
kevin Heifer's International. Listen to this. They give a poor person like, a goat or something. It's a great prank.
creed I wanna work with, uh, Jimmy Carter and help build gnomes.
nellie Dwight, what about you?
dwight I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
andy Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.
nellie Thank you, Andy.
andy I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.
nellie Dwight, you will be participating.
dwight No thank you.
nellie Participation is mandatory; Dwight, but you can choose whatever cause you like.
dwight Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
nellie Great, thank you.
dwight Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
nellie Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight.
dwight Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
creed The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
nellie Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
dwight Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome.
jim There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?
roy Aw, yeah, god, we appreciate everyone coming so early. It's, everyone's just been so nice.
jim Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
roy Are you kidding?
jim That was, that was a surprise.
roy Come on. If it wasn't for you, I never would've met Laura. I mean, seriously, kinda dodged a bullet on that one. Just kidding.
jim You're welcome.
roy Thanks. aw.
jim By the way, man, this place is. beautiful.
roy Started a gravel company. I mean, who knew it'd take off?
jim Gravel company?
roy Yeah. What about you? What are you doing?
jim Not gravel, obviously. No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
roy Oh, cool.
jim Yeah, you never know.
kenny Hey bro, stop wasting time with this haircut. He's got a fifty-thousand dollar sports car. Cheers.
jim OK, Kenny.
clark Duncan, listen, I would love to help you out but where am I gonna find somebody that's pretty, smart and well-informed? Huh? Hold on, hold on. Erin, do you know anybody that might want. Oh my gosh. You love the news, right?
erin Well, it depends. I mean, sometimes I find out things that are really sad.
clark Well, I got a buddy that's a big time local news producer and I can't tell you his name, but it'd blow your mind.
pete Uh, is it Duncan?
clark He's looking for on-air talent and he'd kill me if I didn't get you on tape.
erin You mean, put me on the news?
clark You'll just come over, put on little lipstick, loosen up with a glass of red wine and then we'll just run through a few stories. You know, a couple different ways, with a couple different outfits. It'd be really tasteful and it'd really help me out with Duncan. with my friend. What do you say? Huh?
erin Maybe, ok? Let me think about it.
clark Ok.
erin Whoo!
clark Think it over.
pete No, Clark's not my friend. He is the douche that sits next to me at the office. My friends are Scott, Glenn, and Rob. But, you don't know them.
erin I never really thought much about being more than a receptionist. But, why? Because I happened to answer help wanted ad to be a receptionist? I mean, what if the ad had been for a CEO? Or for a brain surgeon?
roy So, ah, it was a year ago today that I met Laura. I thought she was my waitress and, uh, took her three weeks to tell me that she actually owned the place. You are full of surprises. You are my beautiful mystery girl. And, today, I have a surprise for you.
jim He plays piano?
pam No. Roy? No.
roy You know how I said I was taking boxing lessons? Actually, I was doing this. Um, so, I hope that you like it.
darryl You got this, Roy.
pam We still surprise each other.
jim Definitely.
pam You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-
jim Courtside seats. Sixers.
pam Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-
jim It was an away game.
pam In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. Do we know everything about each other?
jim No.
pam Tell me one thing about you I don't know.
jim Um, ok.
jim Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-
pam And you thought you guys were millionaires.
jim You heard that one.
pam Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.
jim That I thought we were millionaires.
pam Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.
jim That's all right.
angela The senator and I still have mystery. I'm always waiting to see what he's gonna surprise me with next.
jim You all right?
nellie You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
dwight Anything else would be inconsistent.
nellie Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office?
dwight Absolutely, I will.
dwight I feared nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. You don't have a plan. . push;
nellie When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
nellie Looking for this?
dwight What the?
nellie Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
dwight Gimme that.
nellie Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or. someone's getting their hand cut off.
dwight You're insane.
nellie I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
dwight Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
nellie In that case, you. will have to chop off my hand.
dwight This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
nellie I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
dwight Sounds like a plan.
andy clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?
erin Yeah.
andy Clark, you and I need to have a little chat. What clothes does erin need for this news audition?
clark Uh. couple of button-downs, a camisole, a blazer, a pencil skirt, stilettos, maybe, no, no, not maybe, definitely open-toed. Uh, something low-cut because the camera makes everything seem higher cut.
andy Really?
clark Yeah, industry secret. You're gonna want some of those panty hose with the seam up the back.
pete Seems unnecessary for an audition.
clark And then, you know, maybe just a robe to wear in between takes but I probably got one she can borrow at my place, so-
andy Thank god someone here knows what their talking about. I want you to take this credit card, take erin to the mall and get that stuff.
clark I absolutely will do that.
andy Awesome. Plop!
clark Pff. Guess I'll just head over to the mall then. Buy erin some sexy, fun outfits.
pete That Clark, huh? Errr Ca!
oscar Next question for our oldie-weds-
kevin What's the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
angela Language.
phyllis Who was Pam's first celebrity crush?
oscar Pam's first celebrity crush.
toby John Stamos.
jim Ready?
pam Uh-huh.
jim John Stamos.
angela Oh!
pam Yes. But John Stamos was temporary. I quickly moved on to-
toby Johnny Depp.
pam Johnny Depp.
toby Sh, uh, um, I was having this separate conversation with Kevin. Uh, Johnny Depp.
kevin Totally. George Clooney.
toby Uh-huh.
angela OK, I have one. I have one.
kevin What is the craziest place you've ever made whoopie?
angela Kevin, stop it with that question.
jim Right. And did you show them the market? Yeah. And what'd they say? That's awesome! That, oh my god! Wow!
jim It's not even real yet. And I'm not gonna tell her 'til it's real.
pam I think maybe there actually is something I don't know about Jim.
darryl Everyone, we have a voluntary meeting in the conference room to discuss Erin's confidence.
andy Her body. We're gonna talk about her body. Good. Great job.
darryl andy made me his consigliere. Which means Assistant Regional Manager. I guess he thought I'd be into The Godfather 'cause I'm black. Wrong! I'm into The Godfather 'cause I'm a cinephile. I like Scarface 'cause I'm black.
andy erin has an audition to be a newscaster.
andy Uh-huh. And I want her to feel very comfortable in her very sexy skin. So, everybody say something that you like about her body. All right? Darryl.
darryl OK, um, I like Erin's hair. It's a very pretty color.
andy Yeah, right?
jim I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
andy Yeah.
oscar Then why are we talking about her looks? Why not her credibility? Or her reliability?
andy News flash everyone. The human race finds attractive people more trustworthy.
oscar I'm so sorry, Andy, but for twenty years, the most trusted man in America - Walter Cronkite.
meredith Cronkite was hot. If I could go back in time, I'd take that mustache ride.
oscar Does erin have any experience? Has she taken any journalism classes, maybe? Or.
angela Has she done the pageant circuit?
erin No, I watch the news.
andy She's gonna be amazing. Look at her. She's gonna light up the screen.
erin This is a first for me. And, I don't get a lot of chances, so I have to take them really seriously. I will do whatever it takes to get the job.
clark Whatever it takes.
pete Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
dwight This is it. Any questions?
nellie Is it gonna be long?
dwight No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
erin Afghan president Hamid Karzai declared a new policy of dollar days throughout the country. Promising low, low prices on all 2012 Kia Sentras and Sonatas. Aren't you glad you waited? Karzai commented.
darryl Um, where did you get that story?
erin A little bit here, a little bit there. I bet you didn't think I knew current events.
andy I love it. It's fantastic. Now, tag it with your name.
erin For Channel 11 news, I'm erin Hannon.
andy Pause after 'news'.
erin For Channel 11 news. I'm erin Hannon.
andy No, pause longer.
darryl That was a good one.
andy Pause, pause longer. OK? Builds suspense. Don't be shy.
erin Got it. For Channel 11 news.
andy Wha, it's-
erin I'm erin Hannon.
andy OK. All right. Great. Some great stuff in there.
jim I can feel you looking at me.
pam OK. Well, here's something you don't know. A couple of weeks ago-
jim Uh-huh.
pam I ran into this guy from my high school who has just gotten divorced and he hit on me. In the mall. And I didn't tell you because, I don't know, I felt embarrassed. And, I didn't know if you would be mad or worried. But, anyway, I thought you'd want to know.
jim That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
pam Yeah, I would've. What about you? Come on, there's gotta be something. Between your birth and the last two days, something you just haven't had the chance to tell me.
jim Uh.
pam Just tell me.
jim God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
dwight Heh! Ha!
pete Hey, um, I knew something bothered me and I finally figured it out. What news producers are gonna want to see is how erin relates to the other people on the news team.
erin Oh.
pete The weird thing is erin is doing the audition alone.
erin Oh god.
pete Now, I'd say clark could be your co-host. he's already doing camera.
erin Tuh.
pete Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know.
dwight Ha! This is for real this time.
darryl It's getting late. I thought you guys could use a little inspiration.
nellie Oh, a movie. What is this?
darryl 127 hours. It's about this guy who-
dwight No, no. No spoilers. Please.
darryl My bad.
dwight No.
darryl Goodnight.
clark Hey! Everybody.
andy Yeah.
clark Come in.
andy All right!
clark Come on in.
andy Nice.
clark What're you doing here?
pete Sorry, man. andy though erin needed a co-anchor. I'm his makeup guy. My hands are tied.
erin The victim was released from the hospital with second-degree burns.
andy Wow. You know what they say Erin. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.
erin Well, he tried to but the fire door was blocked.
andy He sure did.
clark All right. We got that. That's a rap, everybody.
erin Aw!
andy Just, you sure Clark?
clark Yep, she's done.
andy No, I just, I don't mean Erin. I mean for me. I didn't feel good about that.
clark No, we got it. We got it.
erin Great! Let's get some food. I'm starving.
andy I don't think we did get it. I could do, uh, a couple more takes. We could do it in close-up. That might even be better for editing.
clark OK, I don't.
andy All right.
erin I'm hungry.
andy Uh, Pete, you wanna take erin to get a burger or something?
pete Yeah, whatever you say, boss.
andy OK. I'll call you later.
erin OK.
andy So this is a single.
erin Hey, even if this doesn't work out for me, I'm just glad I had the guts to do it. And, maybe it'll work out for Andy.
dwight Oh god.
nellie That is absolutely revolting!
dwight Yeah.
nellie He is so good, though.
dwight Yes.
nellie The way he just cuts off his arm.
dwight If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
nellie Well, he's a genius, you know? He was in graduate programs at Yale, Columbia and NYU all at the same time.
dwight Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
nellie Well, it doesn't make you stupid.
dwight Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
nellie Stupid like you.
dwight No, like you.
nellie Like you.
dwight You're the stupid one.
nellie You're the stupid one.
dwight You're the stupid one.
nellie You're the stupid one.
dwight You, you, you, you.
