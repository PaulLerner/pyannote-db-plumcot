stanley_hudson This is ridiculous.
phyllis_vance Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
michael_scott Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. Do you have plans tonight?
jim_halpert Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
michael_scott Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
dwight_schrute Thank you Michael.
michael_scott All right, happy Friday. Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
jim_halpert I think you did.
michael_scott I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
jim_halpert Oh, I-
michael_scott You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
jim_halpert Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
dwight_schrute Michael, what time should I be arriving?
michael_scott Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
andy_bernard Hey-o!
dwight_schrute Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?
jan_levinson Hi.
michael_scott Hello.
jim_halpert Hi.
jan_levinson How are you?
michael_scott Come on in. Good to see you.
jan_levinson Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
michael_scott Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
jim_halpert Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
michael_scott Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
jim_halpert Really?
michael_scott Except driving.
pam_beesly We got you this.
jan_levinson Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
michael_scott Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
pam_beesly It's really nice.
jan_levinson So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
jim_halpert Tour, let's do the tour first.
michael_scott Okay.
jan_levinson Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
michael_scott Totally your call babe.
jan_levinson Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
jim_halpert Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
michael_scott Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
jan_levinson Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
michael_scott Well, thats...
jan_levinson This is my office.
michael_scott Yep, never been used.
jan_levinson Not super exciting.
michael_scott No.
jan_levinson And this is my workspace.
michael_scott This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
pam_beesly Uh-huh.
michael_scott As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
pam_beesly So you have an office and a workspace?
jan_levinson I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. Smell.
jim_halpert It's fire.
jan_levinson Uh-huh, Bonfire.
michael_scott Bond.
jan_levinson Men love this one.
michael_scott James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.
jan_levinson When I get frustrated, or irritated or... angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
jim_halpert Just like that.
jan_levinson Just like that.
jan_levinson So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
michael_scott Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
jan_levinson Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
michael_scott Well, I-
jan_levinson Shame on you.
pam_beesly What a cute bench.
michael_scott Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
jim_halpert Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
michael_scott It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
jan_levinson See, he fits perfectly.
michael_scott I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? Voila, right in the wall.
jim_halpert Wow.
michael_scott Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
jim_halpert What is that chestnut?
michael_scott No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
jan_levinson It's pine.
jim_halpert Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
jan_levinson Really?
pam_beesly Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
michael_scott If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
jan_levinson I bet you are.
jim_halpert Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
jan_levinson It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said "Honey keep the trophies."
michael_scott Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
jan_levinson Oh, excuse us just a second.
michael_scott I'll get it.
jan_levinson So glad you're finally able to be here.
angela_martin No, no.
michael_scott Okay.
andy_bernard Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! These are for you.
jan_levinson Oh, how thoughtful.
michael_scott Very nice.
andy_bernard Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.
jan_levinson Aw.
angela_martin What am I supposed to do with this?
jan_levinson How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
pam_beesly Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
jan_levinson Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
pam_beesly Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4 00?
jan_levinson You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
michael_scott When in Rome.
jan_levinson Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
michael_scott Whatever you say babe.
jan_levinson Follow me.
michael_scott All right.
michael_scott How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
all@ Cheers.
michael_scott Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
jim_halpert What was that?
jan_levinson So music, should we turn some music?
michael_scott Yeah that sounds good.
jan_levinson Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter.
Hunter'sCD#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode09 You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, All night, all right, Oh yeah.
michael_scott You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
jan_levinson Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as Pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
angela_martin Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
pam_beesly I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.
andy_bernard No it's a... hump. There's a hump.
jan_levinson Joe Camel!
andy_bernard Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
pam_beesly Montana.
jan_levinson Oh!
pam_beesly Joe Montana!
andy_bernard Yes! Yes.
pam_beesly Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?
michael_scott All right, my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
jan_levinson Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
dwights_babysitter What, no, I'm just making people laugh.
jan_levinson No.
michael_scott Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
jan_levinson I was watching Jim.
michael_scott And he was laughing.
jan_levinson No smiling.
michael_scott Look at him, he's laughing.
jim_halpert Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it.
jim_halpert You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
pam_beesly Oh okay.
michael_scott Well you don't need two of you to do that.
jim_halpert That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
pam_beesly Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
jim_halpert I don't know because I everything I own is there.
pam_beesly You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
michael_scott That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
andy_bernard Michael, you're up.
michael_scott All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
jan_levinson No no no, no names, no names, no rhyming, no soundalikes.
michael_scott All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
angela_martin I don't know.
jim_halpert Katie Holmes.
michael_scott No, Baah! But he's married to her!
jim_halpert Oh, Dawson's Creek.
michael_scott No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
jan_levinson No rhyming!
jim_halpert Not really a rhyme.
angela_martin Another clue, another clue.
michael_scott Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
angela_martin Those aren't helpful.
jim_halpert Tom Cruise!
michael_scott No!
andy_bernard Time!
michael_scott God, does anybody read the paper?!
pam_beesly Oh, thank you.
michael_scott You're welcome.
jan_levinson I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
michael_scott I don't like that story babe.
jan_levinson Come on, it's a cute story, Michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
michael_scott Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
jan_levinson You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
michael_scott Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
angela_martin You shouldn't joke about that.
pam_beesly Is there more wine in the kitchen?
jan_levinson I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, Angela come on. Girl's trip.
jan_levinson Uh, not even close.
angela_martin So you keep a very tidy house.
jan_levinson You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
pam_beesly No, yeah. What?
jan_levinson Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
pam_beesly Oh, are you joking?
jan_levinson Well, Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
pam_beesly I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
angela_martin I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
jan_levinson Mmhmm.
michael_scott So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
jim_halpert Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
michael_scott Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
andy_bernard Thought about it, I'm in.
jim_halpert I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
michael_scott I'm sorry. What now?
jan_levinson Coming!
dwight_schrute Hello.
jan_levinson What are you doing here?
dwight_schrute We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
pam_beesly Awesome.
jan_levinson What is he doing here?
angela_martin Yes, What are you doing here?
michael_scott Dwight is my friend.
dwights_babysitter We weren't invited?
michael_scott You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
jan_levinson Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
michael_scott Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
jan_levinson We saw Wicked.
michael_scott When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
jan_levinson I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay? But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a ing kid.
michael_scott Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
jan_levinson I hate my life.
dwight_schrute So can we come in?
dwight_schrute Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
jan_levinson I'm just gonna check on dinner.
dwight_schrute Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
angela_martin I hate beet salad.
dwights_babysitter It's actually really good.
dwight_schrute Hey hey hey hey. I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
angela_martin The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
michael_scott Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
pam_beesly Like... like what?
michael_scott I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. Hey, looks great babe.
andy_bernard Yeah it does.
pam_beesly I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
jan_levinson Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
michael_scott You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
jan_levinson Oops.
michael_scott Excuse me for a second.
jim_halpert So... how do you guys know each other?
dwights_babysitter I was his babysitter.
pam_beesly And now you guys are dating?
dwight_schrute Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
jim_halpert Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
dwights_babysitter E-mail?
jim_halpert Nevermind.
michael_scott Ok... alright... here we go. There. Oooookay.
jim_halpert That's nice.
michael_scott Everybody enjoying their meal?
jan_levinson Hey babe?
michael_scott Yeah?
jan_levinson How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
michael_scott No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
jan_levinson Ok.
michael_scott Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
jan_levinson At least he's an artist.
michael_scott BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
jan_levinson AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
michael_scott NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
jan_levinson FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
michael_scott MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
jan_levinson YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
michael_scott OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
jan_levinson AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
michael_scott THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
dwights_babysitter I'm gonna get going.
dwight_schrute Fine. Get outta here.
jim_halpert It's getting late.
michael_scott You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
jim_halpert Of course
dwight_schrute Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
cop_1 1 Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?
michael_scott Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
cop_1 2 The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
michael_scott Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
cop_1 1 You wanna press charges?
michael_scott Would she get into trouble?
cop_1 Yes. She'd be charged.
michael_scott I will take the fall. I did it.
cop_1 2 You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet.
jan_levinson Michael! Michael. What are you doing to him?
cop_1 1 Sir, do you have any other place you can stay? Maybe with one of your friends here?
dwight_schrute Michael can come home with me.
michael_scott Jim? Pam?
jim_halpert Oh... my apartment's on fire
pam_beesly Flooded.
jim_halpert Flooded.
dwight_schrute You people. Come on. You're sleeping with me.
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna take you home Michael.
michael_scott Nope.
dwight_schrute Alright.
jan_levinson Bye Babe!
pam_beesly This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
jim_halpert You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
pam_beesly Hmm?
jim_halpert I stole this. For you babe.
pam_beesly One night...
