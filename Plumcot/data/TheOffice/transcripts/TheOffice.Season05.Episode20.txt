jim_halpert You gonna answer that, Kev?
kevin_malone Oh, right. Thanks. Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. Oscar, your mom!
jim_halpert Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
kevin_malone Please hold. Andy! Phone call.
jim_halpert No. Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
kevin_malone Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
jim_halpert It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
kevin_malone Okay. Andy, get ready. Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
jim_halpert Here we go.
kevin_malone Oh, man!
andy_bernard It is 1-3-4, Kev!
jim_halpert Kev, c'mon.
dwight_schrute Hustle!
kevin_malone Hold it.
andy_bernard You are murdering the Nard-dog!
kevin_malone This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you.
angela_martin You're bad at this too!
kevin_malone Just... don't answer that call!
stanley_hudson Just transfer the damn call.
kevin_malone Your call is very important to us. Ple-
andy_bernard Hey-o!
dwight_schrute Way to go.
andy_bernard My maid died.
pam_beesly Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. Look, it's official!
michael_scott Oh, good. My hooker's here. Hi.
pam_beesly Michael, you were expecting me, right?
michael_scott Yes I was. Yes I was.
pam_beesly Are you wearing anything under the robe?
michael_scott That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
pam_beesly This looks great, Michael.
michael_scott Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
pam_beesly Yes, please.
michael_scott What shape?
pam_beesly ... Square is fine.
michael_scott Alright.
charles_miner Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. Yeah.
kelly_kapoor Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
charles_miner Eh, uh, in a hotel.
angela_martin Charles, where were you born?
charles_miner Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. Yeah.
andy_bernard How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
charles_miner Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? Thank you. So, umm...
jim_halpert Would you please stop that?
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert You're breathing very heavily.
dwight_schrute This is how I breathe.
jim_halpert No it's not.
dwight_schrute If you want to tell me -
charles_miner Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
jim_halpert Oh no. I was just -
charles_miner No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear "yes".
jim_halpert ... Yes.
charles_miner Good. As I was saying...
dwight_schrute Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh!
pam_beesly So, what do you say we get started?
michael_scott After breakfast.
pam_beesly I'm full.
michael_scott So how you feeling about the new company?
pam_beesly I feel good. Wow.
michael_scott You excited? About the new company?
pam_beesly Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
michael_scott After breakfast.
pam_beesly We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. Michael. Stop for a second.
michael_scott No, I'm whipping them.
pam_beesly No, I know you are.
michael_scott Just let go.
pam_beesly Just let me have... Oh.
michael_scott Let go, please. Just gimmee -
pam_beesly Fine! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
michael_scott I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
phyllis_vance I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
stanley_hudson I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
creed_bratton Oh, he does. He does.
michael_scott I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
pam_beesly You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
michael_scott I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
pam_beesly I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
billy_merchant Whatever calms you down.
pam_beesly Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
michael_scott Don't patronize me, Pam.
pam_beesly I think you should get dressed.
michael_scott I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
pam_beesly Michael, that seems impossible.
michael_scott It's totally impossible!
pam_beesly We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
michael_scott Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
pam_beesly Great.
michael_scott Okay, Ryan.
pam_beesly No. What? Why?
michael_scott He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
pam_beesly No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
michael_scott Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott He worked at that telemarketing place.
pam_beesly We'll find him.
michael_scott Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
pam_beesly Really?
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly We have an investor already?
michael_scott Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
pam_beesly Michael, that's fantastic.
michael_scott Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. Umm...
pam_beesly Hey! We need to get you dressed!
pam_beesly I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. Hey! You look great! Let's go!
michael_scott Alright.
andy_bernard
charles_miner You a soccer fan?
andy_bernard Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
charles_miner Well, that makes two of us.
andy_bernard No way!
charles_miner Yeah.
andy_bernard I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
charles_miner I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
andy_bernard Ahhh. You b*st*rd! That shoulda been me!
charles_miner Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
andy_bernard Cool!
jim_halpert I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
pam_beesly Next on the list - open the mail.
michael_scott Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."
pam_beesly No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add "find office"...
michael_scott How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
pam_beesly Next on the list -- song parodies.
michael_scott Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
pam_beesly Great. Let's sing it in the car.
michael_scott No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott We can do this.
pam_beesly We can do this.
andy_bernard Whoa! And he just goes, "Boom". Goal!
charles_miner Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
andy_bernard You know your soccer, man.
charles_miner I know. Yes I do.
stanley_hudson I prefer Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
charles_miner Oh yeah?
stanley_hudson From Argentina.
charles_miner I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
andy_bernard I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
charles_miner What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
jim_halpert Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
charles_miner Well, it's not for everybody I suppose.
jim_halpert It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
charles_miner Yeah?
jim_halpert You bet.
dwight_schrute Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
jim_halpert Well I do.
dwight_schrute Wow.
jim_halpert I play.
dwight_schrute You can be so modest sometimes.
jim_halpert Well, maybe you should get back to work.
dwight_schrute Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
jim_halpert Maybe we will someday.
dwight_schrute Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
charles_miner That's a great idea, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
jim_halpert Yeah.
dwight_schrute I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
charles_miner What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
dwight_schrute Jim, what do you say?
angela_martin Sounds fun.
andy_bernard I'm in it to win.
dwight_schrute Game on!
charles_miner Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
jim_halpert Let's... eh... see ya.
charles_miner See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
jim_halpert Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
pam_beesly We got Vikram!
vikram You got me.
vikram Where are we going?
pam_beesly We have a meeting with an investor today.
michael_scott Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. Ah, okay.
vikram He seems really confident.
pam_beesly He can be.
vikram Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.
pam_beesly Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
michael_scott Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. It's Michael.
ryan_howard I'm swamped, Michael. Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
michael_scott Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
vikram He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do.
pam_beesly Yes. Yes, it's possible.
michael_scott Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
pam_beesly Michael! What's going on?
michael_scott I'm...
pam_beesly Hey, Ryan.
ryan_howard Hey, you.
michael_scott Excuse me. Yes?
pam_beesly This wasn't on the list.
michael_scott Yes, it is.
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly It's not.
michael_scott It is.
pam_beesly When did you add this to the list?
michael_scott Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
ryan_howard Sixty thousand dollars a year.
pam_beesly You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
ryan_howard What do you make, secretary?
Supervisor#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode20 Back to work, shoe bitch!
ryan_howard I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
michael_scott Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
ryan_howard What size shoes are you guys?
michael_scott Uh, nine.
ryan_howard What are those, a men's ten?
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott Look what he's doing.
pam_beesly What is he doing?
michael_scott He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
pam_beesly Oh my God.
michael_scott He's already paying for himself.
pam_beesly Sorry!
ryan_howard Where is it?
michael_scott Right here.
vikram Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.
charles_miner Miner -
jim_halpert Oh, there he goes.
charles_miner ...sees his partner -
jim_halpert Yikes.
charles_miner Halpert. He looks up!
jim_halpert Aw, man.
charles_miner Defending duo! He sets him up! He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
jim_halpert Oh! Goal!
charles_miner Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
jim_halpert Aw, it's gonna be the worst.
ryan_howard Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
michael_scott Oh yeah.
pam_beesly Sure.
ryan_howard It was indescribable.
michael_scott Sounds awesome.
pam_beesly Beat.
vikram What sort of investing club is this?
michael_scott Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!
pam_beesly Nana?
nana Michael!
michael_scott People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
michael_scott Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
nana So let's hear it.
michael_scott Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
nana How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
michael_scott By wanting it more. By working hard-
nana What's your mission statement?
michael_scott Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
charles_miner C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
dwight_schrute Wing.
kevin_malone Wag.
charles_miner Jim. What do you play?
jim_halpert Left.
charles_miner Forward or half?
jim_halpert Forward, definitely.
charles_miner Okay, striker, huh?
jim_halpert Striker!
charles_miner Let's see what you got in those legs!
jim_halpert Alright! Let's do it.
charles_miner Alright. No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
jim_halpert Kickoff. My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. Alright!
michael_scott And I offer same day, free delivery.
nana Michael, I don't know about this.
michael_scott Nana. I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
nana I'm not so sure.
michael_scott Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
nana See, this is what concerns me.
Old#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode20 Woman We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.
michael_scott Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
nana This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!
michael_scott Okay.
nana I love you, Michael. I do.
michael_scott Okay.
nana But no. I mean it. No.
vikram I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?
pam_beesly It means grandmother.
vikram Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I'm sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?
vikram You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same-
andy_bernard Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim.
charles_miner Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
oscar_martinez Phyllis, Phyllis.
charles_miner Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
phyllis_vance No, I swallowed a crown.
charles_miner Why'd you duck, Jim?
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
jim_halpert Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
charles_miner Does that make you feel better? Huh?
jim_halpert I'm sorry, Phyllis.
charles_miner Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.
ryan_howard Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
michael_scott Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
pam_beesly I can't do this.
michael_scott What's that?
pam_beesly I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
michael_scott Blech.
pam_beesly I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
michael_scott Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
pam_beesly We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
michael_scott Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. Okay...
pam_beesly How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
michael_scott I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?
michael_scott You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
michael_scott I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up. She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly I could work here. I could see this.
michael_scott It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
pam_beesly Are you good?
michael_scott Yeah, I'm good. You good?
pam_beesly I'm good.
michael_scott You know what they say, keep your friends close.
charles_miner Michael, you're back.
michael_scott Yes, I am, Charles.
charles_miner Mmmhmm.
michael_scott Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
