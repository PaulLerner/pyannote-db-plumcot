ryan_howard Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie.
jim_halpert No. They're in the conference room.
ryan_howard Good.
pam_beesly Wait, are those Michael's Levis?
ryan_howard Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?
pam_beesly Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays.
pam_beesly I'll take those. Thanks.
jan_levinson This is a projection of the county's needs...
michael_scott Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today.
jan_levinson Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...
jim_halpert So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years. Years.
jan_levinson So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-
michael_scott I changed it. To Chili's.
jan_levinson Excuse me?
michael_scott Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson". It's kind of snooty. So.
jan_levinson You had no right to do that, Michael.
michael_scott Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.
jan_levinson It said that.
michael_scott It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.
jan_levinson Alright. But you will let me run this meeting.
michael_scott Uh huh, uh huh. Power trip.
jan_levinson What?
oscar_martinez She had done a background check on me, she had it printed out.
jim_halpert No...
oscar_martinez Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.
toby_flenderson That is unbelievable.
pam_beesly What is going on?
jim_halpert We are doing worst first dates.
pam_beesly Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.
oscar_martinez Ok, that's a joke.
pam_beesly No, they had to come back for me.
jim_halpert Wait, when was this?
pam_beesly Umm... it was not that long ago.
kelly_kapoor Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance.
jim_halpert I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting.
michael_scott Ok, let's do this thing. Wish us luck.
dwight_schrute Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
jan_levinson Thank you.
michael_scott Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.
jan_levinson Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.
michael_scott Well...
jan_levinson Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?
michael_scott No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here. That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao. Adios!
jan_levinson So which way is Chili's?
michael_scott Uh, I'll drive.
jan_levinson Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there.
michael_scott It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
jan_levinson I know Scranton.
michael_scott At all!
jan_levinson Alright.
michael_scott You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
jan_levinson If it's a couple blocks away-
michael_scott Dar de dar.
jan_levinson Ok.
michael_scott Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.
michael_scott We should come up with a signal of some sort.
jan_levinson Why would we need a signal?
michael_scott Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
jan_levinson What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?
michael_scott Well, I... it could be either of us.
jan_levinson You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.
michael_scott Yeees.
michael_scott Hello? Christian?
christian Yes.
michael_scott Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
jan_levinson Just Jan Levinson.
michael_scott No Gould?
jan_levinson No. Thank you very much for meeting with us. Have you been waiting long?
christian No, not long.
michael_scott Uh, Jan, what happened?
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Is Gould dead? What uh-
jan_levinson Michael, we got divorced, ok? I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
michael_scott Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?
jan_levinson Michael. Uh, could we have a table for three, please?
michael_scott When did this happen?
jan_levinson We're in a meeting.
michael_scott Ok.
chilis_hostess This way, please.
jan_levinson Christian.
michael_scott Alright, after you.
christian Thank you.
michael_scott
jan_levinson I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county.
christian Right. Well, Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years. So for us, the name of the game is budget reduction-
michael_scott Awesome blossom.
jan_levinson What?
michael_scott I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
christian Sure.
michael_scott Ok, it's done. Actually, Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done.
jan_levinson So-
michael_scott I heard a-
jan_levinson If you have a-
michael_scott Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?
jan_levinson Christian, you don't have to listen to this.
christian It's ok, I like jokes.
michael_scott Ok.
jan_levinson Just the one.
michael_scott Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
pam_beesly Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael_scott Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
pam_beesly Ok, you want me to read 'em?
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-
michael_scott No.
pam_beesly When-
michael_scott Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.
pam_beesly Ok. There's a transcript between a naval ship-
michael_scott Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?
pam_beesly Sure. There's a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse.
jim_halpert Is this real?
pam_beesly It is a screenplay. Starring himself.
jim_halpert Agent Michael Scarn.
pam_beesly Of the FBI.
jim_halpert How long is this? Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings.
pam_beesly What is that?
jim_halpert Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like.
michael_scott First guy says "Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn". And the second guy says, "Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort". And the third guy says "I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe".
christian Ohhh no! Oh my God, that's funny! I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose!
jan_levinson Excuse me, could I have a vodka tonic, please?
jim_halpert Do we all have our copy of "Threat Level Midnight", by Michael Scott?
all@ Yeah, yeah.
jim_halpert Alright, let's get this started. I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
phyllis_vance That's the character's name?
jim_halpert Oh yeah-
dwight_schrute Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
jim_halpert Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
dwight_schrute You took something that doesn't belong to you.
jim_halpert Dwight-
dwight_schrute Brought it in here-
jim_halpert Do you want to play-
dwight_schrute Made copies of it-
jim_halpert The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
michael_scott Yum! Yum yum yum! That's delicious! I love it!
jan_levinson We would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business, so, Dunder-Mifflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that the warehouse chains just can't match.
christian Well, we are out to save money.
jan_levinson What's the bottom line?
michael_scott Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
michael_scott That's why I wanted a signal, between us, so that I wouldn't have to just shout non-sense words. That's her fault.
michael_scott Did somebody say "baby back ribs"? Hmmm? Hmmmmm?
jan_levinson I don't think Christian has time for that.
christian I have time.
michael_scott I want my baby back, baby back, baby back
michael_scott and Christian I want my baby back, baby back, baby back-
michael_scott Chili's baby back ribs...
jim_halpert Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. Catherine Zeta Jones enters.
phyllis_vance Sir, you have some messages.
dwight_schrute Not now!
phyllis_vance They're important.
dwight_schrute Ok, what are they?
phyllis_vance First message is "I love you". That's from me.
dwight_schrute Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!
dwight_schrute Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.
dwight_schrute If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
ryan_howard Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
dwight_schrute Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission.
pam_beesly Hey, uh, I have to work late.
roy_anderson You're joking right?
jim_halpert Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
dwight_schrute Pow! Pow! Pow!
ryan_howard Hahaha, Agent Michael Scarn, you so funny. Word.
kevin_malone Michael's movie? Two thumbs down. Heh.
jim_halpert A man sitting several seats down, who has a gold face, turns to Michael Scarn. Uh... Ooh, Oscar, you wanna play Goldenface?
oscar_martinez Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
dwight_schrute Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage.
ryan_howard I forget it, brutha.
dwight_schrute Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. Wait, who's Dwigt?
pam_beesly Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.
dwight_schrute D-W-I-G-H-T.
dwight_schrute Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end.
jim_halpert Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
dwight_schrute Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
jim_halpert That's actually a good idea. We'll all take a brief intermission. Hey, are you hungry?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Yeah?
christian So after watching my mom go through so much pain, I decided to keep that promise, that I made to her, and take care of her.
michael_scott Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
jan_levinson Oh no, Michael, Michael, please. No, really.
michael_scott Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing.
christian It's not fair.
michael_scott She's not playing the game.
jan_levinson We'd been fighting for a while-
michael_scott Check please.
jan_levinson He didn't want kids, but I knew that going into it. But he also knew that I did. I guess I thought that he would change his mind; he thought that I would change mine.
christian You didn't.
jan_levinson I was stupid.
michael_scott and Christian No.
michael_scott No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?
christian That's right.
michael_scott You know?
christian You were really brave! You, you put your arms out there, you slit your wrists.
michael_scott It's true.
christian You said "World, this is my blood! It's red, just like yours. So love me!"
jim_halpert I had plans to meet a friend tonight. Which I had to cancel. But this is cool, too. I'm not a complainer.
jim_halpert Wow.
pam_beesly For the bugs.
jim_halpert Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
pam_beesly Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.
christian Right down the street?
michael_scott Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
christian I know.
michael_scott It's bad.
christian It's terrible.
michael_scott It, you know what, it really is.
jan_levinson Uh-
christian I don't know. I guess I could give you guys our business, but you have to meet me half way, ok, because they're expecting me to make cuts.
michael_scott Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
jim_halpert So, I guess I'll see you in ten hours.
pam_beesly What are you going to do with your time off?
jim_halpert Travel. I've been looking forward to it. It's gonna be... really nice. Gonna find myself.
pam_beesly You have new music?
jim_halpert Yeah. Definitely.
michael_scott See ya.
jan_levinson Bye... thanks. Yes!
michael_scott We did it!
jan_levinson We got it!
michael_scott Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.
jan_levinson I am really- Thrilled. Let's go.
michael_scott What!?
jan_levinson Let's go.
michael_scott Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. Oh-ok.
dwight_schrute Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan?
michael_scott Morning, Pam. Hey.
michael_scott No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I. No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So.
michael_scott Hello, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Did you do her?
michael_scott Who.
dwight_schrute Jan Levinson-Gould.
michael_scott Uh, no, no, no Gould.
dwight_schrute Did you do her?
michael_scott This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
dwight_schrute And she is your boss.
michael_scott And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor. Jan, I defend your honor. Is that all?
jim_halpert Jan didn't come back for her car last night.
pam_beesly What!?
jim_halpert Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
pam_beesly Oh, I don't know... Oh my God. This is Jan's cell.
jim_halpert No way.
pam_beesly Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael_scott I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh, Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No. Would you excuse me? No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no. This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk Excuse me? Excuse me?! I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!
jim_halpert Some might even say that we had our first date last night.
pam_beesly Oh, really?
jim_halpert Really.
pam_beesly Why might some say that?
jim_halpert Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
pam_beesly Uh hmm.
jim_halpert Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie. And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date.
pam_beesly We didn't dance.
jim_halpert You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic.
pam_beesly Swaying isn't dancing.
jim_halpert Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
pam_beesly I have some faxes to get out.
jim_halpert Oh, come on, Pam. I-
jim_halpert Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?
