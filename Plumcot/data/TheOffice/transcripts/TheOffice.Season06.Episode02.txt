michael_scott Yeah?
oscar_martinez You wanted to see me?
michael_scott Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
oscar_martinez Yeah sure.
michael_scott I'm going in for a procedure today.
oscar_martinez Is everything okay?
michael_scott Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared.
oscar_martinez I'm sure everything will be fine. What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
michael_scott It is a colonoscopy.
oscar_martinez Okay.
michael_scott In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
oscar_martinez Oh my God.
michael_scott My main concern, should I have a safe word?
oscar_martinez Yeah.
david_wallace Wallace So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
michael_scott Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
david_wallace Okay, I will look at it Monday.
michael_scott Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.
david_wallace Okay, Jim you wanna hit the conference room?
jim_halpert Sure.
pam_beesly Hey, Good luck.
michael_scott Oh right, this thing. I remember now. What's this about?
jim_halpert Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
michael_scott It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
david_wallace No, ah it's okay Michael. We got it.
michael_scott Really?
david_wallace Yeah.
michael_scott Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
david_wallace Okay.
michael_scott Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.
michael_scott Hey let me escort you to your desk.
pam_beesly Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
michael_scott You and Jim are close, huh?
pam_beesly Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
michael_scott Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...
pam_beesly Ummm, I don't know.
michael_scott Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
pam_beesly Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
michael_scott If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk.
pam_beesly Please don't talk about my breast milk.
michael_scott I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott I just don't want you to.
darryl_philbin I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
toby_flenderson And that's how you broke your ankle?
darryl_philbin Yes.
dwight_schrute Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
darryl_philbin This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
dwight_schrute Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
darryl_philbin If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
dwight_schrute Nnnnn, that's not... okay.
darryl_philbin Be quiet.
dwight_schrute I'm talking about... hmmm.
toby_flenderson I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better.
darryl_philbin Thanks T-Man, later. 
dwight_schrute So long Darryl, feel better... He's lying.
toby_flenderson He has a doctor's note.
dwight_schrute Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders.
toby_flenderson A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news.
dwight_schrute Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? Y'all having birthday cake?
toby_flenderson That's not a very good Darryl.
dwight_schrute Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
toby_flenderson Hmmm.
dwight_schrute It just doesn't add up.
toby_flenderson Well, we did a little investigation and Dwight had a good point. The ladder didn't reach the top shelf. I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel. I'll punch you in da mush, see.
michael_scott Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will... I love you too. Bye.
jim_halpert Who was that?
michael_scott Sorry about that. What'd I miss?
david_wallace Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
michael_scott Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting. Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
creed_bratton They've been in there a while.
michael_scott Yeah.
creed_bratton Can't be good.
michael_scott Nope.
creed_bratton Think they're talking about me?
michael_scott No, I think they're talking about me.
creed_bratton Yeah, that makes way more sense. Okay thanks boss.
michael_scott What is Jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.
pam_beesly Hey Kelly.
kelly_kapoor Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
pam_beesly Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
kelly_kapoor Is Ryan going?
pam_beesly I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.
pam_beesly We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls. Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls. Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
kelly_kapoor Here's the deal. I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if Ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong. It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
andy_bernard What can I do for ya Hoss?
michael_scott How are your sales doin'?
andy_bernard How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.
phyllis_vance Again with the cousin.
andy_bernard Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. "Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha."
michael_scott Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?
michael_scott Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
michael_scott You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant.
michael_scott Be my eyes.
andy_bernard You got it.
stanley_hudson What have we here?
andy_bernard Oh, just backing up and turning around.
kevin_malone Hey, we're gonna do this...
andy_bernard Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. Pardon moi, Messieurs. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
david_wallace Cheese platter?
andy_bernard Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit.
david_wallace Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
jim_halpert No, I won't. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it.
david_wallace Thank you Jim.
david_wallace Erin, is Michael around?
erin_hannon I think he's around here...
michael_scott Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'?
david_wallace Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
michael_scott Yes, definitely.
toby_flenderson Sounds like a EMDP-40.
dwight_schrute Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
toby_flenderson You're into trains?
dwight_schrute I have been my whole life.
toby_flenderson Wow.
dwight_schrute I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
toby_flenderson That's so cool.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
toby_flenderson Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
dwight_schrute Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
toby_flenderson Well, you know, 'cause of the trains.
dwight_schrute Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.
toby_flenderson Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.
dwight_schrute Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera!
toby_flenderson Get over there! Get over there!
dwight_schrute Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
toby_flenderson I can't believe this. Hey you, ass****!
dwight_schrute Toby...
toby_flenderson You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
dwight_schrute Ooohhh... Oh man! You okay?
toby_flenderson Just keep going.
pam_beesly Hey Ryan.
ryan_howard Hey.
pam_beesly So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
ryan_howard Yeah, I might stop by.
pam_beesly It costs about $75 per person.
ryan_howard Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
pam_beesly Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
ryan_howard Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.
pam_beesly Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.
ryan_howard Probably, yes.
pam_beesly Kelly Kapoor, yes.
david_wallace Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
michael_scott Look who you're talking to.
david_wallace I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
michael_scott Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
david_wallace What about Jim? Do you think Jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
michael_scott Permission to speak on the record?
david_wallace Please do.
michael_scott Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
david_wallace I thought you liked Jim?
michael_scott Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
david_wallace "Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is."
michael_scott It's not very well written, but you get the gist.
david_wallace Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
michael_scott I can just continue to run it myself.
david_wallace Jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then Jim would be promoted to your position.
michael_scott This was Jim's idea?
david_wallace Mmhmm.
michael_scott Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
david_wallace Ummm... okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping... plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him.
jim_halpert I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
david_wallace Jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
jim_halpert Sure.
michael_scott I can't help but feel partially responsible.
michael_scott Little pick me up? Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush.
jim_halpert When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
michael_scott Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
jim_halpert Why don't we head in your office to talk?
michael_scott Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said...
jim_halpert Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
michael_scott Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.
jim_halpert Michael, did you say anything?
michael_scott Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
jim_halpert Really?
michael_scott Yes!
jim_halpert You will? Wanna do it right now?
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
dwight_schrute I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated.
toby_flenderson If they were dilated...
darryl_philbin Toby! Dwight! Is that them?
Gwenneth#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode02 Definitely.
darryl_philbin You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
dwight_schrute We thought that she was you.
darryl_philbin Why would you think a lady is me?
dwight_schrute Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?
toby_flenderson No, nah. I don't see it.
darryl_philbin Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
dwight_schrute Aww, Darryl.
darryl_philbin C'mon Gwenneth.
Gwenneth#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode02 Sad.
david_wallace This is David.
michael_scott Hey David, this is Michael Scott. Michael Scott here.
david_wallace Yep.
michael_scott Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
david_wallace So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
michael_scott Absolutely, not. Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.
david_wallace Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out... This is not what you said earlier.
michael_scott Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
david_wallace Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
michael_scott Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
david_wallace Michael, I really don't know what's going on down there, but... oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
toby_flenderson Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh...
darryl_philbin Cool.
dwight_schrute Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
toby_flenderson What?
dwight_schrute He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
darryl_philbin Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
dwight_schrute Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby.
toby_flenderson Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
darryl_philbin Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
dwight_schrute Yes!
toby_flenderson You really did it...
dwight_schrute Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
darryl_philbin And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
dwight_schrute Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that...
toby_flenderson Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our... with our lives.
toby_flenderson So Dwight and Darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork. We worked it out.
michael_scott Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it.
jim_halpert How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
michael_scott I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, and now I don't wanna lose the baby.
jim_halpert So instead, you screwed me?
michael_scott That's what she...
jim_halpert No.
erin_hannon David Wallace is calling.
michael_scott Kind of in the middle of something here.
erin_hannon Should I tell him you'll call him back?
michael_scott I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both.
michael_scott Hello.
david_wallace Hey Michael, you got Jim there with you?
michael_scott No, it's just us.
david_wallace Actually, can you call Jim in? I want him on, please.
michael_scott Oh, oh, well here he is right now. Come in.
jim_halpert Hi David.
david_wallace Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone's on board.
michael_scott Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
david_wallace We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
jim_halpert Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
michael_scott I like that, so manager and co-manager.
david_wallace Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
michael_scott Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
david_wallace Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second. Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do?
dwight_schrute Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
michael_scott Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
dwight_schrute I'm... I was making it.
michael_scott Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
stanley_hudson Co-manager of what?
michael_scott Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
phyllis_vance What's happening to you Michael?
michael_scott What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome.
jim_halpert Thank you.
dwight_schrute AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
meredith_palmer Niagara Falls in October? Pfft, hells yeah.
pam_beesly Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
meredith_palmer Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.
pam_beesly Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...
meredith_palmer I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs. I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
pam_beesly You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
meredith_palmer Uh huh.
pam_beesly To ask for directions..
meredith_palmer Right...
pam_beesly And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
meredith_palmer Unless there's ribs.
angela_martin Rude.
pam_beesly So rude, right?
angela_martin Mmm hmmm.
pam_beesly Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible.
angela_martin Pam, my bag was there...
