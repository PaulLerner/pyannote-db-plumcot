erin_hannon Oh. Hey, champions.
toby_flenderson Good morning.
clark Quater finals in an hour. Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
erin_hannon I did. I got some really good sleep.
clark Did you?
erin_hannon Bzzz.
dwight_schrute Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. Practically made of plastic.
nellie_bertram We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill , others relied on showmanship others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
toby_flenderson Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep.
toby_flenderson Ow! Ow!
pam_beesly I didn't see you! You should have yelled "Crossing!"
toby_flenderson I'm sorry!
pam_beesly Ok, so is that my spot?
nellie_bertram We are now down to an elite eight. Well, seven and Toby.
andy_bernard Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
darryl_philbin It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
andy_bernard Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
andy_bernard Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
toby_flenderson Andy?
andy_bernard Go away, we're running lines.
toby_flenderson You wanted to see the gooey eye.
andy_bernard Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
toby_flenderson Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
andy_bernard Yeah, Ok. Alright. Where were we?
darryl_philbin Something full of acid.
andy_bernard And remember Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
darryl_philbin That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
andy_bernard W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
jim_halpert Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
pam_beesly Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
pam_beesly So, we had couple's therapy.
jim_halpert No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
pam_beesly And we have homework.
jim_halpert Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
pam_beesly And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
jim_halpert Mmhm.
pam_beesly Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
jim_halpert Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do "opportunities."
andy_bernard Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla Fern got me a gig.
pam_beesly Hey!
andy_bernard Yeah.
stanley_hudson Who's Carla Fern?
andy_bernard Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
oscar_martinez Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
andy_bernard Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
oscar_martinez But you just!
andy_bernard Not cool.
nellie_bertram Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
robert_from_weyerhammer_paper Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?
dwight_schrute I'm pumped!
erin_hannon Clark's a dead man.
robert_from_weyerhammer_paper Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this.
angela_martin Oh my god!
all@ Whoa.
angela_martin Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
nellie_bertram Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
stanley_hudson Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
nellie_bertram I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
erin_hannon Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously.
nellie_bertram Oh please.
angela_martin Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
phyllis_vance
angela_martin Come here, come here. Let's go.
angela_martin I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
dwight_schrute I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
clark Oh, wide wings, interesting.
erin_hannon Hey. Why don't you back off?...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
erin_hannon Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
carla_fern Fern Are you in that paper documentary too?
darryl_philbin Yep.
carla_fern Fern Do you need an agent?
andy_bernard No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
darryl_philbin I was in The Whiz in high school.
andy_bernard That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says "action."
carla_fern Fern Hey, I made them get you a chair. All my clients sit.
meredith_palmer Can I take your picture?
andy_bernard I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
meredith_palmer We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off.
andy_bernard Got it.
meredith_palmer No, if you could just keep it down until..
andy_bernard Sorry.
nellie_bertram OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
kevin_malone Yes!
dwight_schrute Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?
kevin_malone Uh huh.
dwight_schrute Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
kevin_malone Of course.
nellie_bertram Kevin, did you make that yourself?
kevin_malone Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
nellie_bertram Oh man.
dwight_schrute I call for a refold!
kevin_malone No.
angela_martin Really? Thank you.
kevin_malone This is flatter.
dwight_schrute It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
nellie_bertram Ok, that's enough. This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
kevin_malone I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
nellie_bertram You have to choose one now.
kevin_malone Fine.
nellie_bertram Angela advances.
erin_hannon Nice.
dwight_schrute Whoo!
angela_martin Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
kevin_malone I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
jim_halpert An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
pam_beesly Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
jim_halpert Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
pam_beesly Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
the_director We are rolling and...action!
andy_bernard This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
Producer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode20 Ok, um, stop. Um, why are you smiling so much?
andy_bernard Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
the_director Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one.
andy_bernard So how do you want, how should I do it?
the_director I don't know, just like you're reporting the news or something. Ok?
andy_bernard This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
the_director Ok.
andy_bernard It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.
the_director Who was that?
andy_bernard Tom Brokaw!
dwight_schrute Come on Clark!
angela_martin Come on Clark.
dwight_schrute Whoa!
erin_hannon Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
clark We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
erin_hannon I can't hear what you said. You got your slop?
clark You know what, this is completely unnecessary. You already won...
pete_miller Erin! Erin! Just stop.
erin_hannon What?
pete_miller Relax.
nellie_bertram Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis.
bob_vance Vance, Vance Refrigeration You can do it baby!
angela_martin No you can't baby! Good luck.
dwight_schrute Watch and learn.
erin_hannon Wow.
all@ Oh!
nellie_bertram Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
dwight_schrute Yes!
angela_martin Whoo!
dwight_schrute Oh, Esther.
esther Hey.
dwight_schrute What are you- You're here early.
esther Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.
dwight_schrute I like a little feather in my nuggets.
nellie_bertram Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
erin_hannon Yeah!
the_director Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye.
andy_bernard Which is insanely painful.
the_director Yeah.
andy_bernard And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
the_director That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes. You know, get the chemicals out. Alright?
andy_bernard So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
the_director What water special effect?
Producer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode20 Yeah, yeah just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs.
andy_bernard I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
the_director Dude, we don't need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That's all we're asking.
andy_bernard Darryl, what do I do?
darryl_philbin Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
andy_bernard They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
darryl_philbin So?
andy_bernard I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper.
Production#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode20 Assistant So Andy, so you know how to use this. You step on the pedal, water squirts in your eyes.
andy_bernard Carla! Carla!
nellie_bertram It is time for a little T & A. I give you Toby and Angela.
angela_martin Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. 
nellie_bertram Well, Angela is the winner.
angela_martin Yes!
esther Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?
dwight_schrute Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
esther Oh. Is she a gambler?
dwight_schrute In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
esther Hmm. That is sad.
carla_fern Fern Andy! If you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania. You won't even make an appearance on a security camera!
Producer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode20 What's the hold up here?
the_director The actor's crying.
Producer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode20 Oh god.
andy_bernard She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
darryl_philbin Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
andy_bernard Do you believe in me?
darryl_philbin I believe I want to go home.
dwight_schrute Yeah! Ok! Beat that! Whoo! Ok.
erin_hannon Dammit! Dammit, god. Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I'm really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
pete_miller Yeah. Whoa!
erin_hannon Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
pete_miller Ok Hey hey hey, whoa.
erin_hannon Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
pam_beesly Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
jim_halpert Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
pam_beesly I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
jim_halpert Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
pam_beesly Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-
jim_halpert Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
pam_beesly Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. I appreciate the sacrifice.
jim_halpert Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
pam_beesly Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
jim_halpert I guess I will swallow my truth.
clark Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
pam_beesly We're not high.
pam_beesly I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
kevin_malone The Mark 47 is ready for launch. Less paste.
the_director Here we go. Rolling and... action!
andy_bernard AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
the_director And cut. We can fix the sound in post.
Producer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode20 Yeah.
andy_bernard I can do a better one.
Producer#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode20 That's fine, we'll move on.
andy_bernard I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
darryl_philbin Action!
andy_bernard AHH! AHH! AHH!
carla_fern Fern Kid can act!
andy_bernard Yeah! Yeah.
nellie_bertram Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
dwight_schrute After you.
angela_martin Thank you. Oh god!
nellie_bertram Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.
dwight_schrute Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God.
esther We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely.
dwight_schrute Alright.
angela_martin Don't you dare tank this.
nellie_bertram And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
creed_bratton Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
angela_martin Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
angela_martin I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
jim_halpert I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
pam_beesly Ok.
pam_beesly Jim!
jim_halpert Thanks.
pam_beesly Alright, have a good trip.
jim_halpert Bye.
pam_beesly Bye.
jim_halpert Hey! I...
the_hrpdc_executive Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. And now these three remain Faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
pam_beesly I love you.
jim_halpert I love you.
