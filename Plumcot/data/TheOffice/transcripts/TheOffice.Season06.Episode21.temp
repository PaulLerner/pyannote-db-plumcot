michael Oh, new record!
dwight Okay.
michael Oh, what did you do today?
jim I made a sale.
michael Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
meredith What do we get if we do 'em?
michael My respect. Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
dwight And one girl push-up.
michael Gets to go home. Ooh! I say 'dance, ' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. Disqualified!
angela Ow!
michael What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
creed Oh, come on!

phyllis Ten.
michael Yeah, I'm betting one more.
phyllis Eleven, wow!
michael Good.
everyone Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley.
michael Alright, alright.
oscar Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
michael Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.
dwight 25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
phyllis One more, one more!
oscar You okay? You okay, Stanley?
stanley Excuse me.
jim Wow.
oscar Hey. Matt, right?
matt Hey, Oscar. You're here early.
oscar I always come in at 7. Warehouse
guy No, you don't.
oscar Well. Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
matt I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know.
oscar Yeah.
oscar Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
darryl Hey, what's up?
oscar Hey, nice office.
darryl Thanks, it's cool. So.
oscar You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
darryl Has that ever happened? Ever?
oscar Didn't we? I think we did.
darryl You want me to invite Matt?
oscar Yeah, the whole gang, matt included.
darryl Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
oscar So happy hour.
darryl Happy hour. My pleasure.
oscar All right.
oscar So what do you think?
phyllis Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
phyllis Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
andy A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
jim I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
andy Oh, baloney.
jim Good one.
andy Ring her up.
jim Absolutely, I will do that right now.
jim I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
jim So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
pam Yes! Yes! I would love to!
andy Ha! Knew it!
pam It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
jim I did not see this coming.
andy Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. Are you going later?
erin Sure, if you are.
andy Yes.
erin Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
andy Whoa.
andy We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um. but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
erin Exactly.
andy Yeah, cause when everyone knows- That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
erin Quiet.
andy Hey, boss man.
michael Yes?
andy A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
michael Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
andy I'm sorry, I meant later.
michael Ok, yes. Sure.
andy For happy hour?
michael No, I got that.
andy Trying to get a head count.
michael I am in.
andy All right, yes! It's a deal.
michael It's a deal.
pam Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
jim Okay.
pam I want her to meet Michael.
jim Why?
pam They're both single, I have a sense they might-
jim You've been gone for a long time.
pam It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
kevin Yeah!
pam Hey, how are you?
kevin Oh, I missed you so much.
pam Aw!
kevin Yeah!
pam Yeah!
kevin Waaah!
kevin When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know. that would be funny.
michael Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God!
jim Easy.
michael It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party.
jim Oh, hey, pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
michael Sucks to be you.
jim Would you like to be our fourth?
michael That would be sublime.
jim All right.
darryl So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof. ' It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
pam Hey, Michael.
michael Yes.
pam This is my friend Julie.
michael Hello, how are you?
julie Good. Hi.
michael What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?
pam julie laughs at everything.
julie So you work with pam and Jim?
michael Oh, no, no. pam and jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
julie I should hope not.
michael No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
isabel Hey.
pam Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
isabel Of course.
pam You want to play pool?
isabel Um, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone.
pam Ok.
angela And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
dwight Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
isabel Mm-hmm.
dwight What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
isabel A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
dwight Ooh, I love repartee.
isabel Do you?
dwight Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
michael So, what do you do?
julie I am an ESL teacher.
michael Really?
julie Yeah.
michael See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
julie Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?'
michael Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
julie I was a little nervous when pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done.
jim So what do you think?
michael About what?
jim About Julie?
michael She's nice.
jim Yeah.
michael Yeah.
jim So you like her?
michael Uh, yeah, sure.
jim So pam was right?
michael About what?
jim About you two hitting it off.
michael Well, apparently, michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything.
hide My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart.
oscar I know. . push;
pam Hey, Michael, where have you been?
jim Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
pam Why are you wearing a hat now?
michael Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
michael Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?
jim You want to just make a run for it?
pam Maybe.
kevin Waaaah! Waaaaah! Mommy!
jim What is happening?
andy Whoa! What is crackin?
ryan Guys, one second.
kelly We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
erin What's this game?
ryan One second.
andy Yeah, how do you play?
ryan Guys, guys, guys, please. Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
kelly Only three tickets.
ryan If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
kelly Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
ryan I know, but you wanted the big thing.
andy Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
erin Oh I know.
andy They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
erin 'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already. '
andy 'Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
erin Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
andy No drama. Ok.
isabel Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.
dwight Any brothers or sisters?
isabel Three brothers.
dwight Really?
isabel Two are in the Marines, one's a cop.
dwight Vegetarian?
isabel No. I love meat.
dwight What's your blood type?
isabel O-negative. Universal donor.
dwight Universal donor.
dwight angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
michael Hey, guys, guys, guys. Watch this. Ready?
julie What are you doing?
michael I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
jim Michael, you don't have to do this.
michael Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
michael I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
phyllis Hey, you two having fun?
andy Did you tell them?
erin No.
andy This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
erin I get it.
isabel You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?
dwight Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
isabel Whack!
dwight Extend the fingers more.
isabel Whack!
dwight Good.
angela This looks like a hoot.
dwight Hey, monkey, how you doing?
angela Whack.
dwight Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
angela Okay.
dwight Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
angela It's no worry.
dwight It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
angela I could see enjoying that.
dwight No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
angela But we signed the contract.
dwight Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
angela We both-you didn't dup-
jim Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
pam Maybe it should come from a man.
jim Maybe it should come from a note. with flowers. tomorrow. Bar

oscar I couldn't understand a word he said.
darryl Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
oscar Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
matt Hey, what's up?
oscar There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
matt Anyone up for some hoops?
oscar Sure. Hoops!
matt Let's do it.
oscar Hoop it up, right.
andy This is not what I want my relationship to look like.
andy Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
andy You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
erin You love drama.
andy I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
dwight With this move, he can't get you.
isabel Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler.
dwight Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah!
angela dwight Schrute! dwight Kurt Schrute.
dwight Sh-what?
angela You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.

angela dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
dwight Angela.
angela Did he not tell you that?
dwight You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
angela Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
dwight Angela, not here!
angela Dwight?
isabel Whack!
angela You'll see me in small claims court!
dwight You are an impressive specimen.
isabel Thank you.
