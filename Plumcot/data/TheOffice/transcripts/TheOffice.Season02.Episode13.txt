michael_scott Gotcha! Oh, God. Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
dwight_schrute Good. How are you doing?
jim_halpert So close.
michael_scott Damn it.
michael_scott Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring? Anything. They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind. Well I say that an empty desk means a...
dwight_schrute Empty mind.
michael_scott No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
dwight_schrute Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
angela_martin He's out sick.
dwight_schrute That's unacceptable.
angela_martin I agree it's unacceptable.
kevin_malone Whhh... What are you guys doing?
dwight_schrute Michael.
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Oscar is out sick.
michael_scott On a Friday?
dwight_schrute Can I do some of the talking?
michael_scott I will do all the talking.
dwight_schrute Ok, let him know that I'm here.
oscar_martinez Hello.
michael_scott What difference does it make whether your here?
oscar_martinez Hello?
michael_scott Hi, Oscar its Michael.
dwight_schrute And Dwight.
michael_scott Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
oscar_martinez Yeah I think I came down with the flu.
michael_scott Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
oscar_martinez Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
dwight_schrute Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
michael_scott What are your symptoms?
oscar_martinez I have the chills.
michael_scott Umm, hmmm.
oscar_martinez I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
dwight_schrute Checks out.
oscar_martinez Michael is there anything you need from me? I'd like to go back to bed.
michael_scott I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.
oscar_martinez I'll just be sleep---
dwight_schrute Ok. First impressions?
michael_scott He sounded sick.
dwight_schrute Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
michael_scott That's exactly what I was thinking.
dwight_schrute Question? May I investigate?
michael_scott Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
pam_beesly I bought my veil.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God! That is so exciting! Can I be a bridesmaid?
pam_beesly Ummm...
kelly_kapoor Listen, you don't have to answer now. But how are you going to do your hair?
pam_beesly Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...
kelly_kapoor You'd look like an angel. I'm seriously going to cry.
michael_scott Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier. Man, this must be torture for you.
jim_halpert Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.
jim_halpert Hey Michael.
michael_scott Hey Jim-bag.
jim_halpert Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
michael_scott Really?
jim_halpert Umm, hmm.
michael_scott Who else knows?
jim_halpert Nobody.
michael_scott Wow!
michael_scott Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.
michael_scott My lips are sealed. My lips are sealed... Bangles.
jim_halpert Alright. Great. Thank you.
michael_scott Can you hear me, they talk about us...
dwight_schrute Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?
ryan_howard Yeah, I think I can handle it.
dwight_schrute Do you think? Or do you know?
ryan_howard I think.
dwight_schrute Oh God, here.
michael_scott Hey, whatcha gettin'?
jim_halpert I'm going with grape.
michael_scott Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
jim_halpert Which one?
michael_scott Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation?
jim_halpert I don't know what you mean.
michael_scott P-A-M. P-A
jim_halpert Uh, uh, ok.
michael_scott No it's okay, we're talking code.
stanley_hudson What is?
michael_scott Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
jim_halpert I'm going to take off actually.
michael_scott Alright, well, cool. Still deciding?
stanley_hudson Hmm?
michael_scott Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
dwight_schrute Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
dwight_schrute There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
michael_scott It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.
jim_halpert Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more.
michael_scott Not so much.
dwight_schrute Ok, what is going on here?
michael_scott Nothing.
dwight_schrute Oh, really nothing? Fact You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda. Fact You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.
michael_scott Fact I love grape soda. I always have. Fact Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
dwight_schrute Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
jim_halpert Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
dwight_schrute Is that true?
michael_scott Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
dwight_schrute Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.
michael_scott Ok.
dwight_schrute I can tell. I won't let you down.
michael_scott Good.
jim_halpert Thanks.
michael_scott Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?
jim_halpert I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
michael_scott Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
jim_halpert No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
michael_scott Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
jim_halpert Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea. Let's go out.
michael_scott I know just he place.
michael_scott Oh man, you should order milk. Get it?
michael_scott Why do I like Hooters? Well I will give you two reasons, the boobs and the hot wings.
michael_scott Oh, here we go, here we go. Bogy at 3 o'clock. Hi.
dana Hey I'm Dana. Welcome to Hooters.
michael_scott We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
jim_halpert Nope we're not brothers.
michael_scott I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
jim_halpert Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
dana And for you?
michael_scott Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
dana Oh, it's great. It's served with our world famous wing sauce.
michael_scott Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
dana Is that what you really want?
michael_scott No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
dana Great.
dwight_schrute Who took all the black ones?
pam_beesly That's a communal bowl.
dwight_schrute So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
pam_beesly Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
dwight_schrute Sniffling how?
pam_beesly Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
dwight_schrute Three.
pam_beesly Ok, it was the second one.
dwight_schrute Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?
pam_beesly Nuh-uh.
michael_scott What do you like best about Pam?
jim_halpert Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
michael_scott Is it her boobs, or...
jim_halpert Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.
michael_scott Really?
jim_halpert Uh-huh.
michael_scott Never get's any of my jokes.
jim_halpert What about you?
michael_scott Her boobs, definitely.
jim_halpert Wow, that's not what I meant.
dana Here you go.
michael_scott Oh, thank you.
dana And I understand we have a birthday today.
michael_scott Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
dana Ready girls? Front side.
Hooter's#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode13 Girls You put your front side in; you put your front side out. You put your front side in and shake it all about. You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around. That's what it's all about. Whoo, hoo!
jim_halpert Thank you.
michael_scott Woo! Yeah!
jim_halpert Thanks, thanks Dana.
michael_scott Thank you very much.
michael_scott Hilarious. Hey.
pam_beesly What did you guys talk about?
jim_halpert Just you know politics, literature.
pam_beesly I hate you.
dwight_schrute Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
michael_scott Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
dwight_schrute Including prep time?
michael_scott Just do it.
ryan_howard If I had to I could clean out my desk in five seconds and nobody would ever know I had ever been here. And I'd forget too.
michael_scott Expenses.
kevin_malone Michael is that a wig?
michael_scott No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
kevin_malone No.
angela_martin This is from Hooters.
michael_scott Yeah, it's a business lunch.
angela_martin Did Toby approve this?
michael_scott No he did not. I don't need his permission.
toby_flenderson You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?
michael_scott Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?
michael_scott I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter. And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.
toby_flenderson I'm not processing this.
michael_scott Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?
toby_flenderson He seems fine to me.
michael_scott You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?
kelly_kapoor Pam?
phyllis_vance Angela who would you choose Jim or Roy?
angela_martin It's nobody's business, Phyllis. Roy.
kevin_malone Jim has got it bad for Pam.
creed_bratton Oh ho! Which one is Pam?
kevin_malone Well she's the... Hey Michael so do you think Jim will try to break up the wedding?
michael_scott You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
dwight_schrute As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
kelly_kapoor Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?
jim_halpert Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I don't. Riveting.
kevin_malone Nice... she is so hot.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Did you find anything good in your desk?
jim_halpert Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
pam_beesly Score.
jim_halpert It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
pam_beesly Big day.
jim_halpert Big day.
jim_halpert Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
pam_beesly Right.
jim_halpert And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
pam_beesly No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.
jim_halpert Oh you did?
pam_beesly No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.
jim_halpert No, no, you saw through me, great.
pam_beesly So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?
jim_halpert Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
pam_beesly Mmm, hmm.
jim_halpert And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
pam_beesly Cool.
jim_halpert Ok.
dwight_schrute Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
gil Who's this?
dwight_schrute This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
gil Gil.
oscar_martinez Are you going to tell Michael?
dwight_schrute How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
dwight_schrute Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott I know, I know, I know.
jim_halpert Umm, what happened?
michael_scott I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
jim_halpert Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
michael_scott Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
jim_halpert Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
michael_scott Yeah I'm good.
jim_halpert Good.
ryan_howard Creed did you organize the menu book?
creed_bratton Oh, I thought that was more on a volunteer basis.
ryan_howard No, that was mandatory.
creed_bratton Oh, I thought it was a volunteer thing.
pam_beesly Hey, here's your schedule for next week. Are you okay?
michael_scott Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
pam_beesly Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.
michael_scott No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
pam_beesly No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.
michael_scott It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
pam_beesly Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?
michael_scott Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
jim_halpert Ready?
pam_beesly Yep.
michael_scott People are always coming to me. "Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust." No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.
