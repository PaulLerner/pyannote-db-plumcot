andy What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.
jim I don't know. Oh! That's. not. yours.
jim stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?
stanley What's a seven letter word for purse?
kevin Satchel!
stanley Nope. Starts with an H.
andy Handbag.
stanley Hmmm. Thank you.
andy Shh! Shhh!
michael all right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!
all Yay!
stanley Hold up! That clock is slow. It is five o'clock, I will see you all
tomorrow 
pam Bye, Stanley! Love you!
dwight So long, Stanley!
stanley Night, everybody.
oscar So what kind of statement are you making with that costume, Kevin?
kevin The statement that I am making, Oscar, is that I kind of look like michael Moore.
erin Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin! Happy Halloween! How can I haunt you today?
michael A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! Six seconds, MacGruber! Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! Uh, two seconds MacGruber! Including a. costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board. OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! MACGRUBERRRR!
pam People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!
jim Stop.
dwight Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
jim Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.
dwight To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler. Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old dwight Schrute's mom.
pam What?
dwight You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
pam I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but. jim doesn't want to put his costume on.
jim I am Popeye!
jim I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when pam hands me this little number . no.
gabe In case you can't read m-m-my Poker Face. we will be reviewing our sales policies. I have ten seconds to read them or this whole place blows up.
michael MACGRUBER! Todd
packer Lame. Why don't witches wear panties?
michael Oh, here we go! Todd
packer Because they need to grip the broom!
michael OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
dwight Lake Erie.
gabe When our warehouse workers make deliveries, they're going to be encouraged to offer clients extra products. And then they will split those commissions with sales.
michael So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
gabe That is correct. Todd
packer Has anyone started calling you "Gabe-wad" yet?
gabe Not here.
danny Gabe-wad.
gabe Okay, guys, fun is fun, but-
michael Blackula!
darryl Dracula.
michael Oh, so. I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
darryl Yes. I do remember saying something like that to you.
michael Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
darryl I'm just glad we're gonna try it out.
michael Really? We're good?
darryl Yeah. We're cool.
michael Okay. Okay.
darryl What's under your shirt?
michael Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
michael darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.
toby It's a great stick, right?
ryan It's really good. It's a classic. I think you might win the whole thing with that.
toby Thanks!
oscar Everyone realizes that this coupon book isn't actually worth fifteen thousand dollars, right? You'd have to spend two hundred thousand dollars on crap you don't actually need to get fifteen thousand dollars worth of benefits. I'm not the only one who sees this, right?
toby No.
ryan No.
kelly I get that. I get that.
danny Excuse me, everybody. I want to invite you all to the Halloween party I'm having at my bar.
kevin You own a bar?
danny Public School, at exit 11.
oscar That's a great name. You're hilarious. A plus!
danny So. You're all on the list!
ryan Hey, man, can I get a plus five? It's all guys.
creed Hey, what's the crowd like, Danny? Our age?
danny Okay.
kevin I don't think that she would leave jim for Danny.
phyllis I don't know, they're both handsome.
dwight pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
phyllis I think he-
creed Hey hey hey, quiet, here she comes! Did you hear about that danny guy? Heard he used to date Pam.
jim So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.
pam We were basically Romeo and Juliet.
jim That's right.
pam Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.
jim Yikes.
pam But I've learned to love again. He's a cartoon sailor.
jim Oh, no.
pam And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?
jim No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
andy Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?
jim I don't care.
kevin I am never gonna forget what danny did to Pam. I forget nothing. I'm like an elephant in that way.
andy You know what else? The-this. this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties.
kevin Yeah, and everyone else is gonna be there. Stanley, Phyllis, Angela, Darryl. Creed's a maybe.
andy Creed's going?!
jim Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.
michael Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?
darryl Hello?
michael Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
darryl I'm good.
michael You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
darryl This is embarrassing, Michael.
michael Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
darryl Let me put my shoes on.
pam Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before. or sit on it.
michael This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
angela So, what happened?
michael I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now.
erin Oh!
michael And we are going to straighten this out.
andy Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.
michael Mmhm!
gabe Uh uh. Corporate stole nothing, okay? darryl told me, and then I told them, giving darryl full credit, so. no need to screw corporate! Or anything like that, so. Let's give darryl a round of applause, as planned.
michael I'm a little peeved at darryl right now.
dwight He went to gabe behind your back.
michael No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
dwight He went over your head to go behind your back.
michael What is taking someone from behind?
dwight No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
michael It was a good idea, though.
dwight Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
andy Hey, Danny.
danny Hey.
andy I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.
danny I was looking forward to throwing some darts with you guys.
andy You were?
kevin Okay, well then, uh, I mean, maybe we could do it like. next Halloween.
danny For sure.
andy We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.
danny What are you talking about?
andy Well jim and pam basically begged us not to go.
danny jim and pam really don't want you to go?
kevin They're really upset about the whole danny situation.
danny I'll talk to them.
kevin Yeah, but wait, don't tell them that we said anything to you.
danny Okay.
kevin Or you're dead.
danny Okay.
kevin Okay. . push;
erin Kelly! Great costume!
toby Oh.
angela KELLY! You cannot change costumes in the middle of the day! Pam, she's out.
kelly Um, if I'm out, I'm going to sue this ENTIRE COMPANY for discrimination.
oscar Guys? You're arguing over a one in sixteen chance. Over a prize worth. forty bucks.
kelly Um, fifteen thousand bucks, Oscar.
angela Yeah, shut it, Oscar. Pam?
angela This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
dwight Garbage magnet. Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
michael What the hell are they talking about?
dwight Hmm, kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
michael Do you think that kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. all right. all right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
kevin I am so sorry.
michael Oh, you're sorry?
kevin I just thought-
michael What did you just thought?
kevin Well, gabe asked me if there were any really cool Lady Gaga moves that he could do for the catwalk. And so then I tol-
michael all right.
kevin I told him that there was this one cool move where she powers down like a robot.
michael Okay.
kevin Okay? But I- I am so sorry that I didn't tell you first.
michael Well, don't let it happen again.
kevin You think that I would let this happen again?! NO WAY JOSE.
michael I-
kevin you, Gabe!
gabe Okay.
danny Can you imagine? It's just crazy.
jim That is crazy. We would never care if andy or kevin went to your party.
danny Look, I'm just glad we can laugh about it. Because I was a little nervous about coming to work here, with, you know, our history.
pam Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.
danny Exactly.
jim It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?
danny No! Two or three dates.
pam It was two.
danny Was it two? I thought it was three.
pam No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so.
jim Oooh! You can't handle the truth!
danny Well, that does not sound like me.
pam Yeah? It was though, that's what happened.
danny Well, great, I just wanted to make sure that things weren't weird.
pam Hmm-mm.
michael Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made kevin cry. And gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.
darryl I'm not mad. Are you mad?
michael You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
darryl Well, I'm sorry if it seems that way to you.
michael Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody.
darryl Mike.
michael In front of me.
darryl You made a bad call. And I fixed it. So I'm not apologizing.
michael So that's it.
darryl That's it.
michael Is it?
darryl Yes.
andy Sookehhh. Bill Compton, from True Blood.
stanley How many freakin' vampires am I supposed to care about these days?
oscar I guess you could say I'm still in costume. I'm a rational consumer.
phyllis Oh.
oscar Stupid coupon booklet. Have you seen my costume? I'm a rational consumer.
ryan Yeah, I uh, heard you say it to Phyllis. That's a good line.
pam Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.
kevin Pam. Can you vote for other people?
michael Yeah, I gotta get in on this. Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
michael Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.
pam Michael, this is a bad idea.
michael What's a bad idea?
pam Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?
michael NEVER! Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
kelly Could you for once just let us enjoy a party instead of making it about all your issues?
stanley Raaah!
oscar I present to you the rational consumer, as it were.
pam angela as the nurse!
angela I don't like your tone! Look, they were sold out of all the other costumes, okay? I think we all live in the real world, here. Let's not pretend to be unaware of what sells in this office.
phyllis What should we ask?
michael Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
jim We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
erin He says no.
michael Aaah! darryl moved it. You moved it.
darryl No.
michael Dwight, you saw darryl move it, right?
dwight Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
dwight I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
michael If you had one word you would use to describe darryl what would that word be?
erin A. S. S. H. E. T?
phyllis An asset!
erin Ah! That's enough.
danny I don't think it's gonna work out the way you think. Todd
packer I don't think you get it.
danny Hey.
jim Hey.
danny This is some party, huh?
jim When you work hard, you play hard around here. Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call pam back?
danny Are you serious?
jim Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying. but you know, to not even call her back is.
danny You know what it was? I think she gave me her number but then her fours look like eights, and.
jim Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right. Todd
packer Halpert, you lookin' for someone to bang your wife?
jim Nope.
danny Okay. You wanna know? I didn't call her back because she spent the whole date talking about you. She was obviously in love with you.
ryan Fifty seven. Fifty eight.
meredith Wait, wait. She hasn't moved in awhile.
oscar ERIN!
erin Two! I got two. I ate two whole apples.
pam I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.
jim Just tell her the real reason.
danny Do you honestly want to know why I didn't call her back on a date over four years ago?
jim Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
pam I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like "gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why. "
danny Okay. Honestly. I didn't call you back because I-thought you seemed a little. dorky.
jim Hey, man.
pam Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.
gabe In the future, you need to get Michael's approval on anything before coming to me.
michael Thank you.
darryl You're gonna be missing out on some good ideas.
gabe Okay, well, obviously if it's a really, really good idea, my door is open.
michael If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
darryl You said no to this one!
michael That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
darryl What have you done for me?
michael Oh.
darryl What have you done for me?
michael Well.
darryl Ed Truck hired me. Jo promoted me. gabe listened to me. all you've ever done is say no to me. I have ambition. And you kept me at the same level for years.
gabe Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? This really make you think, Michael?
michael Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
gabe Yeah.
michael You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
darryl I don't understand the point of a hat.
gabe You're right, we don't need a hat.
michael I am not budging on the hat issue.
gabe Okay. We're going to table the hat question. The best ideas are going to come to me, I make the final decision, period.
michael Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
gabe Okay, why don't we simplify this? darryl brings it to Michael, michael brings it to me, no one calls Jo.
michael Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
darryl Cool. Okay. Sorry I lied.
michael Sorry I was a jerk.
michael Friends fight. Friends fight.
andy What's up, man?
darryl Sometimes it seems like it was better down in the warehouse, you know?
andy When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day. Bernard's Regards.
darryl This was your freshman year.
andy I started to ask myself, "Do I have big plans here?" I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group? Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.
darryl No. I got some work to do. I do got big plans with this company.
jim To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?
pam Oh, wow!
jim Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.
pam Aww, my hero!
pam Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner. of the costume celebration spectacular. and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book. oscar Martinez.
kelly If I have to vote for someone, I don't want it to be someone who can beat me.
ryan Shake things up. I'm a Nader guy.
creed Best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen. Like, freaky good.
