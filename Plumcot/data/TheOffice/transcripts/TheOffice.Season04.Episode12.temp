oscar So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again-
michael I'll call back.
kevin You never call back.
pam Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
michael Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.
jan 
michael You can't always work 200 days though.
michael Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting.
ryan You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
michael Yep.
ryan I can get you a tutor if you need-
michael Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
ryan Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
michael N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
ryan Take the call, friend.
michael I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
ryan I insist you take your work calls.
michael Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? Hi buddy.
jan I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a. boys club.
michael Yeah, I hate that.
jan Good.
michael So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
jan And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
michael Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
jan Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
michael Well-
jan Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
michael Disray . My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
jan Does this work for you?
michael Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
jan Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.
michael Million dollars!
jan Four million.
michael Four million dollars! man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
jan No, Michael. Oh, come on.
michael Perfect crime.
jan Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very. you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
michael Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
jan Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
michael I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
jan All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
michael Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
lester A good start. And I think it's busload.
michael Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
ryan Hey Michael.
michael Hey hey.
ryan I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
ryan Could we talk off the record? As friends?
michael I would love that.
ryan Jan. has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
michael Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
ryan Good. That is great to hear.
michael It is.
darryl Game, son!
jim All right, let's run it back.
pam The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
kelly What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
pam Hi, Kelly.
kelly Guess whose boyfriend it is?
pam I don't wanna guess.
kelly I'll give you a
hint It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here .
kelly I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical,
like Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now.
like You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
pam Jim. Can I see you for a second?
jim Sure.
jim Wow.
pam Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
jim Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
pam Please? Kelly's trash talking me because darryl is beating you.
jim What, seriously? What is she saying?
kelly Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
kelly jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
kelly Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
jim So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
pam Sorta, yes.
jim Bring me players.
pam Okay. diane
kelly Hi everyone, I'm diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel.
michael Hi. No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
diane Toby?
michael Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
toby Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
michael Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
jan Michael, just relax, okay?
diane You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So.
michael Okay. All right. Deposition
reporter Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
michael Yessh.
lester Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination?
michael Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
lester Oh. Very good. Well put.
jan People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
pam Hey, Kevin. jim needs to see you.
kevin About what?
pam He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
kevin Are you sure he wants me? Because I have oscar balance my travel receipts.
pam Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
kevin Oh, awesome!
lester How long have you known the plaintiff?
michael I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
lester How long have you known Ms. Levinson?
michael Six years and two months.
lester And you were directly under her the entire time?
michael That's what she said.
lester Excuse me?
michael That's what she said.
lester Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?
michael Uh, wh-why would she say that?
jan Can we just move on to another question?
diane No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this?
lester With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position.
michael Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
jan Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
lester Oh, are you sure?
jan Uh, yes.
lester Can you go back to where this digression began? Deposition
reporter Mr.
schneider And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr.
scott That's what she said.
michael Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it. . push;
kelly Yeah, that's what I thought.
lester Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?
michael She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
lester Can you be more specific? Who are the twins?
michael Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They. make milk.
lester You don't need to go any further. Her breasts.
michael Yes.
lester She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?
michael Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
lester What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?
michael Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
lester Interesting. How so?
michael Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here.
diane Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you?
michael I will allow it.
diane Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please.
michael Uh.
diane That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct?
michael Uh-huh.
diane And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin?
michael Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
diane Wait, excuse me?
michael If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
lester Could we take a short break?
diane No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here?
michael Line.
diane I'm sorry, what?
man He asked for a line, like in a play. Deposition
reporter "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes you did. " "Can I go to the bathroom?" "No. " "I really have to, I've been drinking lots of water. " "You went five minutes ago. " "That wasn't to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question. " "You still have to answer it. " "First can I go to the bathroom?" "No. "
jim Good game Meredith.
meredith Don't patronize me.
dwight All right! What is going on here?
jim Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
jim What the hell?
dwight I told you.
dwight All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, Jörg Roßkopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
michael jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition. diane
kelly Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know.
lester Wait, we'd like to enter to the record a page from michael Scott's personal journal.
michael Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
lester This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. "Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had s*x with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had s*x six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie. "
michael Irie.
lester Irie, sorry. "More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael. " It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct? diane
kelly We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
michael I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary. diane
kelly It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
man OK, let's make ten copies of this diary.
toby Um, can you make it eleven?
man Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.
michael Can I sit here?
toby . You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted.
michael How can you give up my diary like that?
jan I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
michael How'd you even find it?
jan You keep it under my side of the mattress.
michael I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
jan Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
michael Fine. I love you.
jan I love you too. diane
kelly Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as "Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way. "
michael Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
lester Aren't we trying to determine whether michael or jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not michael and this ryan person.
toby Excuse me.
michael Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had s*x with Jan, and yes, I did consider jan to be my girlfriend. However, jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful. diane
kelly OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you.
michael Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that. diane
kelly Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
michael That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot. . of water. diane
kelly Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please?
michael March 17th. diane
kelly And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
michael Yes. diane
kelly You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to.
michael "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs. " diane
kelly Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?
michael diane
kelly Mr. Scott?
pam How's it going?
dwight Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
jim Check this out though, spin serve. Well, it works like 80% of the time, so.
pam Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with darryl now?
jim I think I'm ready.
pam I'll make the call.
dwight Wait a minute, darryl is the client? . No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
jim . Right. Spin-serve!
michael How can you do that to me?
jan 
lester You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record.
jan Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
michael Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
jan Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
lester Starting at paragraph 6.
council "Mr. Wallace, regarding michael Scott, was he a contender to replace jan Levinson?" david
wallace "Yes. "
michael See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
lester 
council "Was he your first choice?" david
wallace "michael scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years. "
council "Was he in the top 5 of contenders?" david
wallace "What do you want me to say? Come on, he's a nice guy. There were many people that I considered. "
council "Was he seriously being considered for the corporate job?" david
wallace "No. "
lester I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?
michael . Absolutely not.
pam Yes! Way to go. See that?
kelly Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
darryl 19, serving 4.
kelly Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
pam You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
kelly What?
pam Let's go. Pick up a paddle.
kelly OK. Bring it on.
pam I am.
kelly Think you can handle this?
pam In my sleep.
kelly OK. Volley for serve, P.
pam O. P.
kelly O.
jim Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
darryl Yes.
david Michael. I am very sorry.
michael Oh, hey no biggie. Just. david
wallace No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
michael Hey, David?
david Yeah?
michael I think you're a nice guy too.
david Thanks, Michael.
michael Why did I do it? I don't know. jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so. You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
michael What do you want to do for dinner?
jan How about Chinese?
michael Sure trying to save some money. get something cheap.
jan That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
michael Do you fast food?
jan Fine, fast food's fine.
