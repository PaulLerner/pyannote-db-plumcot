dwight Stop it!
jim Stop what?
dwight You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
jim Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
jim Yup. That's exactly what we did.
pam It all started when dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight. "
dwight Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
michael Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
jim It's a pen.
dwight Michael, come on.
michael Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
dwight Fine. Hey. Tap away.
michael Ooh! Things with donna are so. oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh. we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and. orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
michael Who enjoys the weekends? Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have s*x. Did I say that? Yes, I did. And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out.
stanley I have an idea for your weekend.
michael Okay.
stanley Let me get back to my desk right now.
michael Okay, you get out of here, big dog. Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
pam stanley got to go.
michael Yeah, well, stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
andy Walk around apple orchards.
michael Oh!
andy Super romantic.
michael That's fun.
dwight Eel fishing.
michael All right.
darryl Curl up with your favorite DVD.
meredith You and donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
michael We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P. F. Chang's.
kelly Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P. F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
michael Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono, " you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
kelly Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
michael You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real
world Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
ryan Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
michael You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
pam No, Michael, no.
dwight Are you nuts?
pam You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place.
michael . and. we had s*x, too.
pam That is right. Don't make any more of it.
michael How?
pam How what?
michael How do I not make any more of it?
pam You could start by concluding this meeting.
michael All right. And she won't say, "I love you. "
dwight Oh, no.
andy How many dates have you been on?
michael Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
andy Mm.
oscar That seems. quick. Even for lesbians.
ryan Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
ryan Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before s*x? Does she shower after s*x? Does she.
michael Yeah, she does all that.
ryan Sorry, dude.
michael No, no.
pam Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
michael Run what?
pam Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
michael Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
pam Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
michael Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
jim You do?
michael Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
jim But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
michael That's what makes it so wrong.
michael Ever since I found out that donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
dwight Oh, God, that tickles. What did.
michael I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
dwight I think I've got one for you.
michael This is you. How much do you charge?
dwight $100 a day, plus expenses.
michael I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
dwight I'm just gonna warn you. and I say this to all my clients. you might not like what I find.
michael Okay.
dwight And you might not like how I find it.
andy Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
stanley My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
andy Hey, gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
gabe There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
andy Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
gabe That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
andy What are we gonna do about this?
gabe I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
andy Let me know what they say.
darryl Wow. That dude is good.
andy What do you mean?
darryl You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
andy I don't know.
darryl Like he was. covering something up? Maybe.
darryl Two years ago, andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient. "
dwight Hi stranger.
donna Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
dwight I work with Michael.
donna Right.
dwight dwight Schrute.
donna Donna, hi.
dwight All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call michael and tell him the sad news.
jim That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
michael It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
pam Oh!.
jim Oh, my God
michael It's comfort food, all right? God.
jim You know Michael, this whole donna thing is gonna be okay, you just. stop beating yourself up.
michael I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what dwight says.
pam Why do we have to see what dwight says?
michael Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
jim Michael, no.
pam No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
michael It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
pam Michael. Okay, I'm. I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
michael God, this is so disgusting.
pam Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
michael I know.
pam And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
michael That's not true. You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
pam Helene.
michael Helene?
pam My mother.
michael Oh.
pam My mother, Helene.
michael Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
jim You should stop this, and you should call dwight right now.
michael All right.
dwight Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
donna Thank you.
dwight It's all yours. Ah!
donna You okay?
dwight Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
donna Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
dwight Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
dwight Oh. Oh. Oh. One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
donna Nope. I'm good, thanks.
dwight Really? Hey, um. Old
lady Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?
dwight Get out of my way. Huh!
dwight Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
donna I'm out of here.
dwight Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm
here to see. you. naked. while. I'm. naked.
donna You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
dwight Donna, come. Ah! Grr! Ugh!
michael You're back. What happened?
dwight Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
michael No, what happened with Donna?
dwight Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.
michael Ugh!
dwight Put your fingers here.
michael No. No! Are you sure?
dwight I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
michael Who eats eight protein bars?
dwight People who don't trust egg whites.
michael Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
dwight Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
michael What? No, she didn't say that.
dwight You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, "What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him. " And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
michael I am not paying for that membership. . push;
michael Ohhh. mmm.
erin Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
michael No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
erin Uh, no. Wait, yes.
michael That's her?
erin Yeah.
michael Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
donna How could you think I would cheat on you?
michael I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
donna That's pathetic.
michael Ye. pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
donna When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak.
michael If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
donna I told you I like you.
michael Well, you are boner-ific.
donna Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would.
michael . poop my pants.
donna Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
michael Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
donna We're going.
michael We are?
donna Yeah.
andy What's up? I got your e-mail.
darryl Close the door.
andy Okay.
darryl I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. andy don't mess with me. I'll figure something out.
darryl Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind gabe and I heard some things.
andy Such as?
darryl It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was "Andy, " "Problem, " "Eliminate, " something. I don't know what it meant.
andy What? You don't know what it meant? How about "andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?"
darryl Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
andy Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
kelly Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
donna Thank you.
kelly Did michael get them for you?
donna No, I bought them myself.
kelly Where?
donna Steamtown Mall.
kelly Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
donna You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
kelly Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
donna Uh, Franklin Mills.
jim What?
pam Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
pam Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
jim Wait, so are you. you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
pam No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
creed Psst.
andy Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
creed So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by andy and go like this. Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
pam So it turns out donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. This photo was taken this morning. It's Cece. She's never gonna do anything wrong.
donna Isn't that something?
michael Wow. That's exciting.
pam Hey, Michael.
michael Hey.
pam I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
michael Well it can wait. It can wait.
pam I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're. I just. you're the only person I can talk to.
michael jim is her husband.
donna Oh.
pam And.
michael And they are having problems, so sh.
pam No, not. we're not. we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love.
michael Good in bed.
pam Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my s*x life with Jim.
michael Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
pam I need you to sign this! So bad!
michael Okay, weirdo.
pam I love . this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely.
donna Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
pam You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at. golfing. Are you a golfer?
donna I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. Hey, you okay?
michael Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
pam Absolutely.
darryl Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
glen I know, it's just, I'm scared.
andy Your text said 911.
darryl Glen, could you excuse us?
darryl It's bad.
andy What's bad?
darryl It's real bad.
darryl Still no plan.
andy Oh, God.
darryl It's getting bigger.
andy I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh. I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
darryl I can videotape it.
andy Yeah.
darryl There it is.
andy There what is?
darryl What?
michael Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
pam I don't know who he is.
michael God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
pam What?
michael I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel. I. no, I'm not going to kill him.
pam You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
michael I have to hear it from her.
pam You have to settle down first.
michael I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
pam Okay. Okay. Yes.
michael I need to have her say.
pam Yeah, but you have to calm.
michael I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"
pam Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
michael No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
pam Hi, Michael, hi, michael
michael Okay. Okay. Okay.
gabe I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400, 000. We've investigated. Every time it's been user error. They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts.
michael You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
donna Yeah, we should.
michael Wouldn't that be fun?
donna Yeah.
michael How about Thursday?
donna Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
michael I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?

donna Shoot. I'm working.
michael Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
donna Well, won't you be at the concert?
michael Nope, that's Tuesday.
donna Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
michael You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
donna How do you know?
michael pam told me.
pam Did she see me?
jim Nice effort.
andy We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress.
darryl You haven't even introduced yourself.
andy Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
darryl You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
andy Higher? Okay. Recently certain events have come to my attention.
darryl Higher.
andy Make it higher? Okay.
darryl Mm-hmm
andy I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation.
darryl One more, yeah.
andy May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger. ah! It's working. It's. I knew it!
darryl This.
andy We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! Nice. Nice. This is my partner, darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
darryl I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
michael Who is he?
donna What, what do you mean?
michael The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
donna It's you. I'm married.
michael I'm the mistress?
