dwight Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?

pam That's a really. well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
dwight Deutsch. let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.

michael Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying "Dunder Mifflin" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
pam Like michael Scott Paper Company?
michael You. oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.
pam Hmm. yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
michael This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
pam Yeah. you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
michael Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?
pam Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
michael Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
pam Yeah. Good.
michael Thank you very much.
pam Mmm-hmm . push;
kelly So that is why I have to leave at 5
 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school. We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians.
charles You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
kelly Yeah I don't like talking.
charles Come in.
angela I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone. I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about. Earlier.
kelly Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just.
angela Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar. I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
charles Did michael just let anybody in his office? angela and
kelly Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like 'Come on in!"
charles I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
kelly So you should be heading back to your desk.
angela Okay. Bye Charles. Well you'll let me know. Good bye.
kelly She's such a special person. And she's turning 50 this year.
michael I'm starting my own paper company.
andy No way!?
michael Yeah.
andy In this climate?
michael Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.
andy Ehh. well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um. hmmm. michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
dwight Your own paper company.
michael Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
dwight Right.
michael Potential, lots of potential. yes.
dwight What a courageous venture.
michael It's. it's very courageous, very exciting. Um.
dwight Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities.
michael That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so. You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
dwight Okay. So yeah.
michael So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.
dwight You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
pam Everyone, can I have your attention. This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right?
meredith Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
pam Meredith. Oh. so uh. G-44. It's not ready Kevin!
pam I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
oscar 
oscar You put a note in my food?
michael I made it sterile.
oscar Just to say "sterile" doesn't make it so.
michael I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
oscar Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials?
michael No, no no.
oscar You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
michael Okay.
oscar Five years?
michael Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me.
oscar It's just not prudent Michael.
michael Stanley?
stanley Can't you see I'm urinating?

stanley No.
michael Just. I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
stanley No.
michael Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
stanley No I didn't.
michael You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
pam How's it working?
phyllis Um, let's see. it's fine.
pam Good.
pam I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels.
charles Hey Hank, You ready?
hank Yeah.
charles Okay, Michael?
michael Hmm?
charles I can't pretend I haven't seen that. So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk out. And you can't take anything.
michael Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks.
charles not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank.
hank Okay Michael.
michael Hank? You really think hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort charles from the building.
hank Come on man, let's, let's go.
kevin I always thought michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy. And he's super funny. Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there.
michael Well here we are. I would just like to.
charles No, no no no. You're done, Michael.
michael Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!
andy What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
kevin I think he's singing.
oscar I can't believe this is really happening.
michael . and I feel free!
oscar And just like that. As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone.
andy The whole office feels darker, you know? It's just a sad dark day.
phyllis andy He's gone.
andy I know.
phyllis You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
toby michael is like a movie on a plane. You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch. And when it's over you're like. how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
pam Michael?
michael Shh shh shh. don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
angela These are for employees only.
michael angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
kevin Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
michael I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere.
kevin But you didn't want to start with us?
michael No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?
jim I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
michael So which way are you leaning?
jim Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
michael Thanks Jim.
charles Hey, did anyone see the client list that michael was supposed to be working on.
dwight No.
charles Okay, let me know if you find it.
michael Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go!
charles michael get up!
michael Oh God. okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
charles Michael, what are you doing?
michael I think maybe hank should be here.
charles Hank? No, I don't need hank Michael.
michael You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.

jim I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
pam Okay, see you later.
