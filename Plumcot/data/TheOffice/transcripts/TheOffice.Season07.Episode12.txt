skateland_dj Next up, secretary Schrute will read the minutes from Sunday's meeting.
dwight_schrute Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
jim_halpert Oh.
dwight_schrute This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
dwight_schrute Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
jim_halpert I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
skateland_dj Dwight, don't be bothered by your friend's presence.
dwight_schrute What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? Dwight, don't be bothered by the . Over the line, Jim.
jim_halpert I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
dwight_schrute Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
jim_halpert Sounds good.
dwight_schrute Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
jim_halpert Smart.
dwight_schrute And the rest was just stuff.
skateland_dj Go ahead and read it, some people weren't here.
dwight_schrute Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
jim_halpert Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
Member#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode12 It was pretty cool.
jim_halpert Was it?
Member#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode12 It was fun.
dwight_schrute It was pretty awesome.
jim_halpert Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
michael_scott January three, 2011. A day which will live in-famously. Holly Partridge Flax, otherwise known as Holly, otherwise otherwise known as a living, breathing angel, is engaged to another man. This is freaking me out. I- okay, let's switch to the happy video, okay? No, no, no, no, let's push through. We'll do this.
michael_scott Today will either be the best or the worst day of my life. Holly gave AJ an ultimatum. He either proposes by New Year's or they break up. Now, if she's engaged, I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm gonna start attacking people. If she's not engaged, in all honesty, I may just burn this whole place to the ground out of happiness. Either way, I am going to need some talking down. And nobody talks me down like myself in a video talking me down.
michael_scott Michael, I know what you're thinking. Holly's engaged to another man, and you want to kill yourself. It may seem like a good idea, but it's not.
erin_hannon Snot. Sorry, it sounded like you said it's snot. I am so sorry.
michael_scott Okay, so killing yourself. I was just thinking about snot.
angela_martin Good morning.
pam_beesly Hey, guys! Fun thing. The index cards on your desk are resolution cards. You write your New Year's resolution on them, I'll collect them, and then display them on... da-da-da-da-da! This! Resolution board.
dwight_schrute Wow. Did your baby draw that?
angela_martin The glitter is blinding.
phyllis_vance I think it's good.
pam_beesly It's gonna be fun.
pam_beesly I recently met Sue, the office administrator at Vance Refrigeration. She has this awesome wall full of fun initiatives and morale boosters and stuff. Sue just goes for it, she's awesome.
phyllis_vance I know Sue. She's not that great. And you know her husband's in a wheelchair, right?
erin_hannon Okay, champagne.
michael_scott Happy.
erin_hannon Sponge.
michael_scott Sad. To soak up my tears.
erin_hannon Gummi bears and gummi worms.
michael_scott Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
erin_hannon Ukulele's happy?
michael_scott Sad, something to break.
erin_hannon Chocolates.
michael_scott For you, job well done.
erin_hannon Thank you! And two bottles of scotch.
michael_scott Both sad.
erin_hannon And did you get the tickets?
michael_scott I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.
erin_hannon I'm really excited for Michael either way. Because if Holly chooses to be with him, he will be so, so happy. And if not, he'll be avoiding the biggest mistake of his life!
pam_beesly Oh, hey, guys! I'd like to introduce you to a new little friend of mine. His name is New Year's resolution board.
michael_scott Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
kelly_kapoor What happened? Is there a ring?
michael_scott So... high five me. We're back. To a happy... look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
kelly_kapoor Come on!
holly_flax They're warm.
michael_scott They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
dwight_schrute Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
michael_scott Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
kevin_malone Congratu-ohhh.
kelly_kapoor Wow.
michael_scott Oh my God! That's it! That's it!
holly_flax Oh, I get it. Everybody knows about the ultimatum.
kelly_kapoor Yes, I told everyone.
holly_flax Ha ha, ha ha!
kevin_malone Hey! Right back atcha, bitch!
michael_scott Happy! Happy, happy, happy, happy!

pam_beesly Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.
dwight_schrute Not doing that.
pam_beesly Why not?
dwight_schrute I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
andy_bernard Drink less caffeine. That's a good one, Pam. Here's mine.
pam_beesly Learn to cook for one!
andy_bernard Yeah. I love cooking, but I always find myself throwing out half the food that I prepare, so... two years is time to just start preparing the right amount of food for the right number of people, which is one.
pam_beesly Well, maybe you'll meet someone.
andy_bernard No, some people don't just meet someone. I'm fine with it. Really. This is not a pity party. It's not a party at all. It's just sad.
pam_beesly Angela.
angela_martin Yes.
pam_beesly Make time for romance!
oscar_martinez Who's the senator?
angela_martin My boyfriend.
oscar_martinez Oh, you mean the state senator. I'm sorry, I was confused, because you accidentally wrote 'the senator'.
angela_martin Ugh.
dwight_schrute Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
angela_martin Oh, God.
andy_bernard That's a good one.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
andy_bernard You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
dwight_schrute Awesome.
darryl_philbin You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. s*x already? Whoa...'
andy_bernard The bookstore?
dwight_schrute It's that easy?
darryl_philbin I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
dwight_schrute Okay, I'll drive.
darryl_philbin My resolution is to read more. And if someone else is driving me to the bookstore, I can eat my PB&J in the car. 2011 is coming up all Darryl.
michael_scott Hello! Oh, somebody's got a new phone!
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott That is neat.
holly_flax I got it for Christmas. I'm so out of my league here.
michael_scott E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
holly_flax Holly misses old phone.
michael_scott Why?
holly_flax New phone is confusing. Gets bad reception.
michael_scott Bummer.
holly_flax Bummer.
michael_scott Reese's Pieces.
holly_flax Reese's Pieces?
kelly_kapoor Oh, God, please stop!
michael_scott I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.
holly_flax Oh, I should get this. Hey! Oh, no, don't go see that one, I want to see that together. Yeah, go see that action one. Okay. I love you, too. All right.
michael_scott Holly doesn't seem to be engaged, but she's talking to AJ like she is. I can't figure it out. Do you think she's already dating a different AJ?
pam_beesly I don't think so.
michael_scott When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott But you did still love him.
pam_beesly I'm not... I'm not going to have...
michael_scott Do you love him now?
pam_beesly No! Just talk to her.
michael_scott No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend. Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
phyllis_vance I'll talk to her, Michael.
michael_scott You think she'd talk to you?
phyllis_vance Why wouldn't she?
michael_scott That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
pam_beesly There's a plan.
andy_bernard All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
dwight_schrute I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
darryl_philbin I got that cutie behind the counter.
Bookstore#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode12 employee Well, if you read a lot, you should check out our e-readers. They're really neat.
darryl_philbin Whoa, I work at a paper company, those things terrify me. They could put us out of business, you know? I heard those machines hold like, ten books at once.
Bookstore#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode12 employee Actually, it's ten thousand.
darryl_philbin Holy , what? Let me see that. It's so light. Like a croissant.
andy_bernard Hi.
nate Hi.
dwight_schrute Welcome.
andy_bernard Let us know if you need anything.
nate Thanks.
andy_bernard Why did we pretend like we work here?
dwight_schrute Is that what we were doing?
darryl_philbin Hey, how'd you do?
andy_bernard Good!
dwight_schrute Good. Real good.
darryl_philbin Really?
dwight_schrute Yeah, yeah!
andy_bernard We kinda nailed it.
dwight_schrute Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
darryl_philbin Cool.
dwight_schrute Okay. What'd you get?
darryl_philbin A book about oceans.
dwight_schrute Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
darryl_philbin No, that's uh. p0rn. Pornography. Old lady... nasty... p0rn.
phyllis_vance Follow my lead. Hey, want some company?
erin_hannon Want some company?
holly_flax Oh, sure. Have a seat. How were your breaks?
phyllis_vance Oh, really good, I went to Portugal.
erin_hannon I went to Portugal.
holly_flax Oh, wow... you went together?
phyllis_vance No.
erin_hannon No.
phyllis_vance So, I've just gotta know. What's going on with you and AJ?
holly_flax Nothing really happened. I mean, I know I made a big deal about this whole New Year's deadline, but um, it came and went... and, we're still together.
phyllis_vance You didn't break up with AJ at all? I mean, not even for a week to make him buy you a present?
holly_flax It just wasn't fair of me to give him an ultimatum in the first place. The whole thing is totally my fault. But we're going to be just fine. Just fine.
darryl_philbin Whoa! Hold on.
dwight_schrute I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
darryl_philbin Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
dwight_schrute Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
darryl_philbin I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
dwight_schrute Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
andy_bernard Hey, there's a roller rink across the street! There's always chicks at the rink.
darryl_philbin What kind of chicks are you going to meet there?
andy_bernard I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
dwight_schrute Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
andy_bernard Roller derby practice!
darryl_philbin We're going skating.
pam_beesly The goal of this meeting is to get everybody excited about their resolutions! Who's been good about their resolutions so far? Erin. Tell us about it.
erin_hannon Well, my goal was to learn a new word every single day. And I must say that it is going immensely.
pam_beesly Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre.
gabe_lewis Intercepted!
erin_hannon Hey! Gabe.
gabe_lewis Whoops.
pam_beesly Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?
creed_bratton I want to do a cartwheel. But real casual-like. Not make a big deal about it. But I know everybody saw it. Just one stunning, gorgeous cartwheel.
pam_beesly How is it going?
creed_bratton I'm having a little trouble motivating.
pam_beesly One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.
michael_scott Or sooner.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott That's not a joke.
pam_beesly But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying. In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?
kevin_malone Well, I said that I would eat more vegetables, and I haven't yet. But it's okay. I still have time, since last year, I ate none.
pam_beesly Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.
michael_scott Is it?
pam_beesly Yes! Because with all of your support, by this time next year maybe I'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week.
michael_scott Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12 01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
kevin_malone Well not all of us are Michael Freaking Scott.
michael_scott What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
creed_bratton Well, I can't, I don't know how.
michael_scott You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.
creed_bratton My tombstone's already made, thank you.
michael_scott Just do a cartwheel!
erin_hannon This is all I could find.
michael_scott Eat it.
pam_beesly You don't have to do that, Kevin.
kevin_malone I don't know. I'm glad this is happening. Thank you, Michael.
kelly_kapoor Why are you eating stem first?
kevin_malone This is a new food for me, how else should I eat it?
ryan_howard The other way.
kevin_malone Can I get some cheese whiz? Or hollandaise?
michael_scott No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
pam_beesly Oh, Michael.
michael_scott Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
kevin_malone God, I hate it.
michael_scott I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!
angela_martin All right!
michael_scott Eat it!
kelly_kapoor You're killing him, Michael!
michael_scott All right, all right, shh!
kevin_malone All right, I ate the fluffy part, can I be done?
michael_scott Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue. Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
kevin_malone Can I get some candy, or something?
michael_scott No! You can't have any candy!
oscar_martinez I'll get him water.
pam_beesly Okay, Michael, just settle down.
michael_scott Holly Flax.
holly_flax Yes, Michael?
michael_scott Not Michael, E.T.
holly_flax What's up?
michael_scott Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
holly_flax Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
michael_scott Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
creed_bratton You think?
michael_scott And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
kevin_malone You were super mean.
michael_scott It was insensitive and I am sorry.
kevin_malone It was traumatizing, Michael. I wouldn't be surprised if I never ate a vegetable again.
michael_scott I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
kevin_malone Okay, Michael, no offense, but you need to get your own life.
michael_scott You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
creed_bratton I don't think I'm there yet, Boss.
kevin_malone Well, I am.
michael_scott Okay, oh! All right.
kevin_malone I'm going to help you.
michael_scott Okay.
DJ#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode12 Hey, uh. It's just you. Anything you want to hear?
andy_bernard Um... Dave Matthews Band. No hits! Deep tracks only.
DJ#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode12 Okay.
andy_bernard I said no hits!
ryan_howard I just feel blocked. Like I'm living, but I'm not...
kevin_malone Hey, Ryan.
ryan_howard Yeah.
kevin_malone How's your fart project coming?
ryan_howard That's real, real classy, Kevin. Hey, was it me or you that just shoved the butt end of a pound of broccoli into my mouth because Michael told me to?
kevin_malone Me.
pam_beesly Kevin, don't! Come on!
kelly_kapoor Oh, Pam, soda. Caffeine!
pam_beesly Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
meredith_palmer Well, if you don't have to do 'em...
kelly_kapoor Meredith, what are you doing? I could be pregnant!
ryan_howard Okay, no.
kelly_kapoor My resolution was to get more attention.
ryan_howard No, she's lying.
kevin_malone Hey, Ryan.
erin_hannon One, two, three. I did it! I did a cartwheel!
creed_bratton you! you! God!
pam_beesly Okay, that's it.
pam_beesly Lesson learned.
darryl_philbin Sup?
andy_bernard Hey! Where did you go?
darryl_philbin To the arcade.
andy_bernard Oh, cool.
darryl_philbin Why, did you meet someone?
andy_bernard Yeah, I did actually. His name is Andy, and he roller skates like a Greek god and you know what? I kinda like hanging out with him.
darryl_philbin Right on, son.
dwight_schrute Gentlemen.
andy_bernard And where did you go?
dwight_schrute Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
darryl_philbin Right.
DJ#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode12 So, that's it, guys? If you want, I can put on the strobe.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
erin_hannon You want to keep this?
michael_scott No.
erin_hannon Do you want to keep this?
michael_scott Yup.
erin_hannon Do you want to keep this?
michael_scott You can toss them.
michael_scott My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.
holly_flax We're gonna be just fine. You know how you say something over and over and the words start to sound weird? Going to be just fine... just fine... just fine... just fine...
holly_flax I just think we need to cool things down for awhile. Yeah, a break. At least until I get back to Nashua. Yeah, I'm sure.
michael_scott Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.
creed_bratton Mmmhm.
michael_scott You ready to do this?
creed_bratton Yes, sir.
michael_scott You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
creed_bratton I really appreciate it, Boss.
michael_scott It's about you. It's about you. Go!
creed_bratton I did it!
michael_scott You did?
creed_bratton The perfect cartwheel.
michael_scott Okay.
creed_bratton What a rush! That's all I had to do all year.
michael_scott Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
