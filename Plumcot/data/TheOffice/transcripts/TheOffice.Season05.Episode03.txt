dwight_schrute Hey Michael?
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
michael_scott OK, just remember to keep breathing.
dwight_schrute My cervix is ripening.
michael_scott OK, good.
jim_halpert Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight. Now, this baby will be related to Michael through delusion.
dwight_schrute Michael! My water's breaking!
michael_scott Oh, OK! OK!
dwight_schrute Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
michael_scott I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
dwight_schrute Right. Highways or surface roads?
michael_scott I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
dwight_schrute No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!
michael_scott I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby.
dwight_schrute It's about adapting to the circumstances.
michael_scott Andy, would you like to have my baby?
andy_bernard Yes! Yeah. Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!
dwight_schrute No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa!
michael_scott All right, OK. Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!
dwight_schrute The pressure! The pressure!
michael_scott Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
dwight_schrute Aaaaaaaa!
michael_scott Aaaaaaaa!
dwight_schrute Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
michael_scott Just keep pushing...
dwight_schrute Hold me!
michael_scott I'm right here.
dwight_schrute Cradle my head!
michael_scott I'm right here, I'm right here.
dwight_schrute I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
michael_scott All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.
dwight_schrute Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
michael_scott Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late.
dwight_schrute No! I don't want natural!
michael_scott No. You have to just push it out!
dwight_schrute OK!
michael_scott Keep simulating.
dwight_schrute Aaaaaaaa!
michael_scott OK!
dwight_schrute Do you have the Sharpie?!
michael_scott Keep simulating.
dwight_schrute Do you have the Sharpie?!
michael_scott Yes, I do!
dwight_schrute OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
michael_scott OK.
dwight_schrute Ready?!
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Aaaaaaaa!
michael_scott Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
dwight_schrute Butter. Newborns are slippery.
michael_scott Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again.
michael_scott It is going to be the happiest day of my life.
michael_scott Hello ladies, how's my shower going? Phyllis, did you get the live storks?
phyllis_vance No.
michael_scott Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry. Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?
angela_martin Per your instructions, we have the personalized M&Ms with the baby names. This is your boy bowl, with the name "Chevy." And this is the girl bowl, with M&Ms with the name "Astird."
phyllis_vance That can't be right.
angela_martin Michael wrote down "Astird."
michael_scott She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
meredith_palmer Ass...turd.
michael_scott I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
michael_scott It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine. I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub. Have you seen that video? It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.
phyllis_vance Hey, I'm collecting for the baby shower.
kevin_malone But Phyllis, it's not his baby.
phyllis_vance I know, Kevin.
oscar_martinez Why do we have to pay money to get a gift for his ex-girlfriend's unborn sperm bank baby?
phyllis_vance Look at it as if you're paying for the cake, not the baby. Sheet cake.
phyllis_vance I do enjoy being the head of the Party Planning Committee. I'm no longer under Angela's heel, and her little grape head is under mine.
michael_scott Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them.
phyllis_vance Sorry.
michael_scott Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis. Pump it!
pam_beesly So you know Stacy, right?
jim_halpert Right, the one from England.
pam_beesly There's no one from England, Jim. Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.
jim_halpert Oh. Right, that style.
pam_beesly So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.
jim_halpert OK...
pam_beesly Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.
jim_halpert Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
pam_beesly No, Sarah Kaya comes in. Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.
jim_halpert OK.
pam_beesly So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, "No way. You can't reserve seats." And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.
jim_halpert No... way!
pam_beesly Yes!
jim_halpert Ha ha. That's hilarious?
pam_beesly No, it's horrible! Jim, she might get arrested.
jim_halpert Who, Stacy?
pam_beesly No, Stacy is a boy. Ugh. Frustrating. Why can't you just be in art class with me?
jim_halpert Uh...
pam_beesly Oh, wait, I gotta go, class starting.
jim_halpert OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. That was a good story.
dwight_schrute Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
andy_bernard Yo. I got the Nard-puppy for ya. What's going on here?
angela_martin It's a baby game where you guess whose picture is whose.
andy_bernard Awww. Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?
angela_martin That's Phyllis.
andy_bernard Well -
angela_martin Yeah, it is. So I hope you two are very happy together. Pervert.
andy_bernard Why would that make me a pervert, I -
angela_martin Well, it does. That's me.
andy_bernard That's not you.
angela_martin Yes it is.
andy_bernard That's mean, come on, that's -
michael_scott Ahoy, matey.
holly_flax Ahoy.
michael_scott Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
holly_flax Good.
michael_scott Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
holly_flax Of course. Yeah.
stanley_hudson I do not like pregnant women in my workspace. They're always complaining. I have varicose veins, too. I have swollen ankles, I'm constantly hungry - do you think my nipples don't get sore too? Do you think I don't need to know the fastest way to the hospital?
jim_halpert Jan.
jan_levinson Hi, Jim!
jim_halpert What do we have here?
jan_levinson This is my baby.
jim_halpert Really...
dwight_schrute Oh no...
dwight_schrute Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.
michael_scott So this is Astird.
jan_levinson Astrid.
michael_scott Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?
jan_levinson Well, um, you know, labor just kind of started very suddenly and-
michael_scott I could have helped.
jan_levinson And the birth instructor thought it wasn't a good idea for you to be there, so...
michael_scott Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
jan_levinson OK, you don't have any idea what I've been through, so, let's...
michael_scott No, I don't!
jan_levinson I'm sorry, I thought today at the baby shower would be a good time for the two of you to meet.
michael_scott Can I hold her?
jan_levinson Yes, yes you can. You know, I think, just leave her in the car seat. Yeah.
michael_scott All right, OK.
michael_scott I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways. I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me. It feeds my soul. Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them. But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit. If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war. There would be no government, and things could get terrible. It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.
michael_scott Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office Assst...
jan_levinson trid.
michael_scott ...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
jan_levinson Well...
michael_scott Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go. Lion King!
jan_levinson Michael, Michael, Michael, that's... yeah... that's too high. I'll take that.
michael_scott OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
holly_flax You OK? You seem kind of...
michael_scott I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
michael_scott Ready to play some games? Let's do it!
kevin_malone Michael, the baby's already been born.
michael_scott Uh, duh.
kevin_malone So we had games planned but the baby ruins all of them.
michael_scott No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do.
kevin_malone OK... Who wants to guess when the baby will be born?
michael_scott All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents. I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
jan_levinson Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
michael_scott Whatta we got?
angela_martin Um, we all chipped in and got you this stroller.
michael_scott Oh!
jan_levinson Thank you.
michael_scott She already has a stroller.
kelly_kapoor And this is way worse than the stroller she came with.
oscar_martinez She's got an Orbit; that's a twelve hundred dollar stroller.
dwight_schrute Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
michael_scott OK, what else?
dwight_schrute Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.
jan_levinson Being good isn't always easy / No matter how hard I try / When he started sweet-talking to me / He'd come and tell me everything is all right / He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right / Can I get away again tonight / The only one...
pam_beesly Hey you!
jim_halpert Hey! You busy?
pam_beesly Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
jim_halpert OK, OK, so you gotta hear this. So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyone's just staring at her.
pam_beesly I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-
jim_halpert The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
pam_beesly I can't hear anything!
jim_halpert Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
pam_beesly OK.
pam_beesly I'm not frustrated. Even if I were in Scranton, Jim and I would have days like this. We're just... a little out of sync. You know, that's all. Oh, great. I washed my lipstick.
jan_levinson How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
dwight_schrute Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!
dwight_schrute Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
dwight_schrute Playtime is over!
andy_bernard So Jan, tell my intended about the miracle of childbirth.
jan_levinson Well, actually, I, uh, I had a tub birth. And it was really, really quite amazing.
angela_martin You gave birth in a tub?
jan_levinson Yeah, it's a really nice transition from womb to world, you know, kind of like a big womb.
kelly_kapoor Um, so you're in the tub with everything?
jan_levinson Oh, yeah, the afterbirth floats, yeah.
creed_bratton Must be like the tide at Omaha Beach.
jan_levinson Oh no, it's actually really hygienic, Creed.
creed_bratton Ugh.
stanley_hudson I'm done.
oscar_martinez Me too.
jan_levinson And after the birth you get out and deliver the afterbirth.
michael_scott Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
michael_scott I could have helped.
jan_levinson You're sad about this. I know that, and I wish that I... but... would it help if you held Astrid for just a, a little bit?
michael_scott Uh, yeah.
jan_levinson All right. Um, I'm just going to lie down for a couple of minutes. I'm exhausted, so um. Remind me to talk to you about Astrid's 529. Wake me in twenty.
michael_scott I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
michael_scott Phyllis? Could you take-.
michael_scott Hey guys.
darryl_philbin What's up, Mike?
michael_scott Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
darryl_philbin You a baby daddy?
michael_scott Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
darryl_philbin Hell yeah. You know why? Because that was my baby.
michael_scott I just saw this baby daddy-
darryl_philbin You should stop calling yourself "baby daddy."
michael_scott Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
darryl_philbin Because you're not a daddy, and it's not your baby.
michael_scott Well-
darryl_philbin You feel connected to his baby over there?
michael_scott It's- that's different.
darryl_philbin You feel connected to this?
michael_scott That's not a baby.
darryl_philbin You want to hold me, to see how you feel?
michael_scott Could I?
darryl_philbin No.
jan_levinson Oh. I was just catching up on my sleep.
holly_flax I can imagine.
jan_levinson Where's Astrid?
holly_flax Oh, I think she's on a sales call.
jan_levinson On a what?
holly_flax Waaa! More paper! Waaa! No, she's just on a coffee break.
jan_levinson That's funny.
holly_flax She's with Angela.
angela_martin That's good. Now, I need you to - I need it to look up here. Get the baby to look up here, ready?
andy_bernard OK. Yeah. Look at my finger. Look. Looook!
angela_martin Now. Come on, up here!
andy_bernard Look up here!
angela_martin Your hand's in it.
andy_bernard What? Sorry.
angela_martin Yeah, that's a good one.
jan_levinson What are you doing? What's going on? Excuse me.
andy_bernard We're taking a picture.
jan_levinson There you are.
andy_bernard She's nature's bounty.
jan_levinson You don't flash around a newborn baby. Don't you know that?
jan_levinson Michael, I need your help.
michael_scott I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
jan_levinson Uh... come on.
dwight_schrute I like to call this... the bumper test.
michael_scott Sure you can't stay a little longer?
jan_levinson Oh, no, Michael, you know what? I really have to go.
michael_scott All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving.
jan_levinson You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
dwight_schrute Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
jan_levinson Ah. Thanks, Dwight.
jan_levinson OK. You know what? There is, uh, there is one more thing that you can do for me.
michael_scott OK?
jan_levinson Don't date Holly.
michael_scott Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
jan_levinson Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you... soon.
michael_scott All right.
jan_levinson OK.
holly_flax You still gonna be mean to me?
michael_scott You wanna go out?
holly_flax Yes.
michael_scott I didn't feel much when I held Astrid, but I got a good feeling from Holly.
jim_halpert Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message.
pam_beesly Hi.
pam_beesly Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message.
jim_halpert Hey, it's me. It is 5 03.
pam_beesly I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
jim_halpert You must be out or something.
pam_beesly I'll leave a message.
jim_halpert Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
pam_beesly I guess this is just one of those days. It'll get better.
jim_halpert Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
pam_beesly I finished my laundry. Got all my socks. Nothing like that time that crazy guy pushed you.
jim_halpert Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
pam_beesly And then, remember, we went shopping the next day to buy me a washer and dryer?
jim_halpert Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.
pam_beesly You're probably upset that I'm even at a Laundromat right now. But, don't worry, I'm being safe. And I'm headed home. I'm... headed to my dorm. Not home.
jim_halpert Wish you were home. Uh, anyway...
pam_beesly Anyway, um... I miss you.
jim_halpert I miss you.
