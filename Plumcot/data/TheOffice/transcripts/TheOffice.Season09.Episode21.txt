jim_halpert I'm taking some time off from work—well, my other work—because we needed it.
pam_beesly It's great.
jim_halpert It's great.
pam_beesly The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
jim_halpert But that doesn't matter. This does. It's the only thing that matters. We've had some really nice days together.
pam_beesly Nice morning, too.
jim_halpert Beesly! Oh, my god.
andy_bernard Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial.
jim_halpert Ah, definitely blue.
andy_bernard Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond?
jim_halpert For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin—
andy_bernard Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
jim_halpert Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can't give 100% to two things at once you know.
andy_bernard Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
jim_halpert Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing.
oscar_martinez Is everything ok?
angela_martin No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
kevin_malone Wait, all of them?
angela_martin Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
oscar_martinez That's—that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry.
angela_martin It's the that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
kevin_malone I've never met anyone like that.
angela_martin And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
oscar_martinez Angela, you still have your son.
angela_martin I guess.
dwight_schrute Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and—
jim_halpert Smasher!
dwight_schrute Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
dwight_schrute I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
dwight_schrute I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
jim_halpert Fireball!
dwight_schrute Ah! That's how it's done.
jim_halpert That's pretty good. I feel safe.
david_wallace Wallace Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?
erin_hannon Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said "is Indian" and was like, "Is Indian what?" Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
erin_hannon Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
erin_hannon Yes, there's Andy! Andy is in. I'm a good receptionist, I know he's in.
andy_bernard David Walrus, in his native habitat.
david_wallace Wallace Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
andy_bernard Yeah.
david_wallace Wallace This isn't going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, "The kind that's good for head shots." And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it's gonna boost office morale. Now, he's a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
david_wallace Wallace Andy—
andy_bernard I'm gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
david_wallace Wallace Uh-huh, but—
andy_bernard Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I'll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
david_wallace Wallace So you think you've been too focused on your job?
andy_bernard At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
david_wallace Wallace So you—you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
andy_bernard Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don't—it just... I owe it to myself and my future fans.
david_wallace Wallace Uh, well, I guess I can't stand in the way of a man's dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
andy_bernard Thank you, David.
david_wallace Wallace There's probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
andy_bernard Nope. I have made up my mind. I'm really sorry.
david_wallace Wallace Well, good luck.
andy_bernard Thank you. Not gonna need it.
david_wallace Wallace Okay.
david_wallace Wallace Well that kind of worked out.
creed_bratton I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
jim_halpert Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
clark Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I've earned this. I mean, you know?
jim_halpert You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here.
clark Right. Well, I'm here to sell paper.
pam_beesly Wow.
clark All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And—and Wallace is here today. And I don't him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
pam_beesly it's okay. You can sit in the annex.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly I'll come visit you.
jim_halpert Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk if that's okay with you.
clark That's fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete's beautiful, dead eyes.
andy_bernard Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
oscar_martinez I can't say we didn't see it coming. But it's a sad day when anybody is fired. We're so sorry, Andy.
david_wallace Wallace Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
andy_bernard I wasn't fired. What are you talking about? I'm fired up, yes. Guys, I'm—I'm leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
pam_beesly Oh, Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah, so, I'll see you on the red carpet. See, that's how it works.
phyllis_vance Andy sings beautifully. And he's really good at dancing. He's a good speaker. But there's just something there you don't want to look at.
jim_halpert Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
pete_miller Yeah, a little bit.
jim_halpert Oh, wow. But, um—Oh, I get that.
pete_miller Oh, no, no, no. No it's cool.
jim_halpert I get it.
pete_miller It's cool, man. I'm sure you and I will have our own thing.
jim_halpert Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
darryl_philbin I just think you're going into this a little fast.
andy_bernard I'm 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
darryl_philbin Show business is cold. Let's say you get a job, which you probably won't. They're not gonna cut you any slack. You're meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
andy_bernard All right. I get it.
andy_bernard The male is a funny species. We don't just tell each other how we feel, that's chick stuff. So instead of saying, "Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don't want you to leave." You say something like, "Hey, Andy, you're making the worst mistake of your life. You're not talented." Well... right back at you, Darryl.
andy_bernard I'm gonna miss you too. Mmm!
stanley_hudson Andy's from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
kevin_malone Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird, in the park, that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to cause the park is free!
sensei_billy I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.
dwight_schrute He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
sensei_billy It's not a large room, I think they heard me.
dwight_schrute Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.
sensei_billy That's really ok. I'm mostly focused on the belt here.
dwight_schrute Just slip it off my—Slip it off my hips.
sensei_billy Hold it—Take a step back. Take a step back. Okay, okay. I can't—I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off.
dwight_schrute He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
angela_martin Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
dwight_schrute There it is.
sensei_billy Congratulations.
dwight_schrute We did it, we did it. I love you.
sensei_billy Okay.
dwight_schrute Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?
sensei_billy Yes, I will.
dwight_schrute Sensei, you're not watching.
sensei_billy Yeah, I'm watching. Just do it.
dwight_schrute Watching?
sensei_billy I'm watching.
dwight_schrute Watch this part, okay?
david_wallace Wallace Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
sensei_billy Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.
david_wallace Wallace He said that? He's an odd guy, isn't he?
sensei_billy Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he's one of the most tenacious and determined men I've ever met.
esther Oh! I'm am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
jim_halpert I really felt like I almost lost her, and—and nothing is worth that.
david_wallace Wallace Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn't even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
clark Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
dwight_schrute You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool.
clark All I'm saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager's chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
dwight_schrute Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager.
david_wallace Wallace So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
jim_halpert Again.
david_wallace Wallace Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
jim_halpert Not at all. It should be Dwight.
david_wallace Wallace You sure?
jim_halpert You're gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh—
david_wallace Wallace Yeah.
jim_halpert Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person.
nellie_bertram Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
andy_bernard It's now or never.
nellie_bertram Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
andy_bernard Yeah, sure. What's your question?
kevin_malone Our question is—it seems dumb.
andy_bernard Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
nellie_bertram Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and "full-ass" it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
andy_bernard Nah. I like my plan better.
kevin_malone Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor.
andy_bernard What?
oscar_martinez No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
jim_halpert Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
pam_beesly Yes. Yeah.
jim_halpert I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
pam_beesly Oh, boy. Um—
jim_halpert If you could help me out, that would be—
pam_beesly I could give you some beginner stickies?
jim_halpert Anything would help.
pam_beesly Here you go.
jim_halpert Oh, also, while you're at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert Wow, that's—
pam_beesly It's all yours.
jim_halpert You come so prepared. Aspirin.
dwight_schrute You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
jim_halpert Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great.
dwight_schrute Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?
jim_halpert No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
dwight_schrute Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed.
jim_halpert I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.
dwight_schrute Hello.
andy_bernard Well, hello.
dwight_schrute Big day for you.
andy_bernard Big day for you.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
andy_bernard Love the belt.
dwight_schrute Oh, yes.
andy_bernard You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!
dwight_schrute This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
andy_bernard Thank you, I appreciate that. ‘Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
dwight_schrute Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
andy_bernard No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
dwight_schrute Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job.
andy_bernard Nothing is impossible to him who will try. Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
dwight_schrute You're bad.
andy_bernard I'm gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
andy_bernard Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That's something you can't take back.
erin_hannon So true. Is there a question, or are—what?
andy_bernard Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
erin_hannon Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
andy_bernard Thank you.
david_wallace Wallace You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
andy_bernard Thank you.
david_wallace Wallace Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
dwight_schrute Say it again.
david_wallace Wallace Will you be the new manager?
dwight_schrute Where?
david_wallace Wallace Where?
dwight_schrute What branch?
david_wallace Wallace Here. Scranton. Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news.
dwight_schrute I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
david_wallace Wallace What?
dwight_schrute But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute... Manager.
david_wallace Wallace Why do you already have this?
dwight_schrute In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
david_wallace Wallace I know.
dwight_schrute I will never, ever let you down.
david_wallace Wallace I know, Dwight. I know. Okay. Okay. All righty. You're gonna do great.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Wow, hey.
pam_beesly Hi.
jim_halpert What's up?
pam_beesly Um, I have a question.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Oh, I had a question.
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly I did!
jim_halpert Yeah, totally you did.
pam_beesly Super important.
jim_halpert I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert All right? I'm gonna wait.
pam_beesly All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
jim_halpert I'm sure you did not. What was your question?
pam_beesly I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
jim_halpert Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I'm waiting.
pam_beesly Exactly.
andy_bernard Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I'm gonna stay on in sales.
nellie_bertram Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
meredith_palmer Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don't want to see you in a p0rn next year.
andy_bernard Okay.
kevin_malone Ooh, there's a great play about a salesman.
andy_bernard Death of a salesman.
kevin_malone I don't think so.
andy_bernard Sure, ‘Death of a Salesman' by Arthur Miller, it's a great play about crushed dreams.
kevin_malone No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
andy_bernard Got any hot leads?
pete_miller See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
erin_hannon I had no idea. And here I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep.
jim_halpert Look who's back.
pam_beesly I'm back. Oh, hey, look, and now it's like a double date.
pete_miller Wow. Cause, uh
erin_hannon Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That'd be fun.
pam_beesly Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
erin_hannon Well, how about Thursday?
pam_beesly Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because of—
jim_halpert Weeknights are actually tough just because—
pam_beesly They are.
jim_halpert That's true, yeah.
erin_hannon Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
david_wallace Wallace Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute—
dwight_schrute David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again?
david_wallace Wallace I don't think so.
dwight_schrute It's just one thing. Just let me—let me do this—
david_wallace Wallace Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on—what I was about to say was Dwight— Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta—This'll be a second, sorry.
dwight_schrute Just wait and send it to voicemail.
david_wallace Wallace Yeah.
dwight_schrute Come on. Come on.
david_wallace Wallace Then we'll get him a new set of drums.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute is manager!
andy_bernard Brava, brava.
creed_bratton Creed Bratton is the new manager!
pam_beesly What's going on?
kevin_malone Dwight's the new manager. He freaking did it.
pam_beesly Congratulations, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Pam.
jim_halpert Congratulations, buddy.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Jim.
clark Congrats, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Get out of Jim's seat.
clark But I fought for this seat.
dwight_schrute You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we'll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
pam_beesly It's nice to have you back.
dwight_schrute So...
jim_halpert So.
dwight_schrute I wanted to offer you a new position.
jim_halpert Let's hear it.
dwight_schrute Assistant regional manager.
jim_halpert Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.
dwight_schrute Jim.
jim_halpert I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.
dwight_schrute Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
jim_halpert Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
dwight_schrute So, all the numbers adding up?
oscar_martinez Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but... congratulations, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
angela_martin Yes. Congratulations.
kevin_malone Yeah, and Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations.
angela_martin This is a big day for you.
dwight_schrute Yes, it is. Carry on.
andy_bernard How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It's cause I had a fallback. That's the problem. When you have fallbacks, it's just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
andy_bernard Everyone! Changed my mind again.
phyllis_vance What's it now, dream or no dream?
andy_bernard Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim?
jim_halpert Oh, don't look at me cause I think you're making a terrible choice.
andy_bernard All in! Whoo!
andy_bernard Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
toby_flenderson Okay, then, Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah, but here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
toby_flenderson Andy, you know I can't do that. It'd be lying.
andy_bernard Seriously?
toby_flenderson Yeah, I'm—
andy_bernard Come on, just do it.
toby_flenderson I can't.
andy_bernard All right, fine, just know that you made me do this.
toby_flenderson Oh, come on. Andy, no.
andy_bernard God, Toby, don't—stop blocking my hand.
toby_flenderson No, no.
andy_bernard This is your—you brought this on.
toby_flenderson No, no. Andy.
andy_bernard Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
angela_martin This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem it's clearly on your end. And—oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um... what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting!
kevin_malone What do you think that was about?
andy_bernard David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
david_wallace Wallace We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
andy_bernard What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
david_wallace Wallace Enough, Andy. Enough!
andy_bernard Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
david_wallace Wallace Oh my god.
andy_bernard Eleanor Roosevelt once said ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.' I think she's right. I feel calm now. I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing.
angela_martin Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah.
angela_martin What are you doing?
andy_bernard Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top.
angela_martin Yeah, okay. That's not what I mean. You don't have to leave because you said you would. Don't let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It's not worth it.
andy_bernard Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too—
angela_martin Ugh.
andy_bernard But I just—it's in the past. And I feel like we shouldn't...
angela_martin No, that's not—
andy_bernard Rehash—
angela_martin No, none—No, stop. It's just—
andy_bernard Exactly.
angela_martin Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
andy_bernard Thanks, Angela. You too.
angela_martin Thanks.
andy_bernard A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
nellie_bertram Oh, good lord.
stanley_hudson Can't you just leave?
jim_halpert You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
andy_bernard Tuna, I'm a performer. And perform I shall.
dwight_schrute You okay?
angela_martin It's just a really nice song.
kevin_malone Awesome!
phyllis_vance Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He's not terrible.
stanley_hudson Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
phyllis_vance No, he's good.
stanley_hudson He was good.
oscar_martinez Good night, Kevin.
kevin_malone Night, Oscar.
oscar_martinez Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
angela_martin Well, I've changed my mind.
oscar_martinez Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in a—
angela_martin Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
oscar_martinez Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
angela_martin Oh, god.
oscar_martinez Come stay with me.
angela_martin You don't want me at your place.
oscar_martinez I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do.
angela_martin Well...
oscar_martinez Separate bathrooms.
angela_martin Thank you.
oscar_martinez You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff...
angela_martin Okay.
oscar_martinez And get you the hell outta that place.
angela_martin Are you allowed to have pets?
oscar_martinez Oh, Angela.
dwight_schrute Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
darryl_philbin You talk to Wade and Colin?
jim_halpert No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?
darryl_philbin We got an offer on the table.
jim_halpert What kind of offer?
darryl_philbin A buyout.
jim_halpert What?
