pam_beesly We could get Deangelo flowers.
dwight_schrute No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
phyllis_vance That's true.
jim_halpert All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?
dwight_schrute Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?
jim_halpert Nope. Baskets have it.
jim_halpert So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
jim_halpert Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan, gather my things from my desk.
jim_halpert Wait...
pam_beesly What have you done?
dwight_schrute Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.
mose Aaaaahhhhh!
pam_beesly Can't stay there all day.
jim_halpert I'm coming.
pam_beesly Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
jim_halpert You'd slow me down.
jim_halpert Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10 30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
pam_beesly Stop stalling! Come on.
all@ I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...
all@ but Oscar ...under God...
all@ ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
angela_martin Amen.
dwight_schrute Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
erin_hannon Ooh, about what?
dwight_schrute That's on a need-to-know basis.
erin_hannon I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
dwight_schrute General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
jim_halpert Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
dwight_schrute Define foment.
jim_halpert You define foment.
dwight_schrute Please take note of the new color-coding system.
dwight_schrute Aha!
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
dwight_schrute Gotcha! Why are you late?
kelly_kapoor It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
dwight_schrute All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.
andy_bernard In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
erin_hannon Oh! Darryl's funny.
andy_bernard I know, right?
gabe_lewis Hey, Andy?
andy_bernard Yeah?
gabe_lewis Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
andy_bernard Sure. What's going on?
gabe_lewis Are you still in love with Erin?
andy_bernard What?
gabe_lewis Because I am. I need to get her back. I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
andy_bernard No, this is horrifying.
gabe_lewis No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
andy_bernard We're just friends, okay?
gabe_lewis Do you promise that?
andy_bernard Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
gabe_lewis No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
dwight_schrute Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
jim_halpert Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
dwight_schrute You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
jim_halpert Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.
dwight_schrute Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
jim_halpert And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.
kevin_malone One...
stanley_hudson $0.50" with a camera pointed at it]
andy_bernard Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in.
dwight_schrute I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
kevin_malone No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
creed_bratton He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
pam_beesly You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
creed_bratton No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
phyllis_vance He means the ice pack.
erin_hannon 2 00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or -
gabe_lewis I'm sorry. This can't wait.
erin_hannon He's just gonna call back.
gabe_lewis Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God.
erin_hannon What?
gabe_lewis Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
erin_hannon Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
gabe_lewis Well... it's just... it messes up my rhythm.
erin_hannon I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
jim_halpert Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
dwight_schrute Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
jim_halpert And the desk.
dwight_schrute The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
jim_halpert I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
dwight_schrute Don't make me fire you.
jim_halpert You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
dwight_schrute Don't make me pre-fire you.
jim_halpert You wouldn't dare.
dwight_schrute Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
jim_halpert If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
dwight_schrute How you doing, Jordan?
jordan_garfield I'm good.
dwight_schrute Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
jordan_garfield Why are you telling me this?
dwight_schrute Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh... it's a holster.
dwight_schrute Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. Ohh... Oh, what a day. What a day.
pam_beesly Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
dwight_schrute The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
andy_bernard Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
dwight_schrute The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
pam_beesly Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
dwight_schrute Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
angela_martin Thank you.
phyllis_vance You could put your cell phone in it instead.
dwight_schrute Uh... hello!
kevin_malone You could put a banana in it.
dwight_schrute Why would I put a banana in my holster?
kevin_malone In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
pam_beesly Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
dwight_schrute Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah!
erin_hannon Andy!
andy_bernard Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
oscar_martinez My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
andy_bernard Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
meredith_palmer Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
toby_flenderson Hey, what happened?
kelly_kapoor Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
dwight_schrute No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
andy_bernard Something's definitely wrong.
oscar_martinez I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
angela_martin Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
oscar_martinez Firewall.
gabe_lewis I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
dwight_schrute Okay, why are you calling Jo?
andy_bernard I think I should go the hospital.
erin_hannon I'll go with you.
gabe_lewis No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
darryl_philbin I'll take him.
andy_bernard Thank you, Darryl.
darryl_philbin What's wrong with you?
andy_bernard It's my ear.
darryl_philbin Yeah.
andy_bernard Okay, sorry.
toby_flenderson Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
gabe_lewis I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
dwight_schrute Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
dwight_schrute Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
stanley_hudson We all saw you do it.
dwight_schrute Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
erin_hannon Navy blue. Little red anchors.
dwight_schrute I have no way of knowing if that's true.
toby_flenderson I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this?
dwight_schrute Okay, really?
toby_flenderson Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
ryan_howard I felt terrorized.
dwight_schrute Come on.
toby_flenderson Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
dwight_schrute I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
ryan_howard Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
dwight_schrute Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
andy_bernard Hey. We're back.
dwight_schrute There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
andy_bernard Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
dwight_schrute Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
andy_bernard Yeah.
phyllis_vance How's your hearing?
andy_bernard Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
darryl_philbin I was talking like this. I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
kelly_kapoor Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
dwight_schrute American Idol? What? No.
kelly_kapoor Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
dwight_schrute No.
kelly_kapoor Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
dwight_schrute Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
phyllis_vance Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
angela_martin Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
kevin_malone Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
dwight_schrute I put everything back in the vending machine.
kevin_malone Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
pam_beesly You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
dwight_schrute Okay.
jim_halpert Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
dwight_schrute Thank God.
jim_halpert Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
dwight_schrute What's jazz hands?
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute Fine.
dwight_schrute
kevin_malone What the is that? Oh, my...
jo_bennett Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.
dwight_schrute Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
jo_bennett Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
jim_halpert Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
jo_bennett Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic.
dwight_schrute Well, what can you do? Life.
andy_bernard We have to clean this up now!
erin_hannon She had so much -
gabe_lewis Hey, guys.
erin_hannon Hey.
gabe_lewis Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
andy_bernard No!
gabe_lewis Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
andy_bernard Uh...
gabe_lewis I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
andy_bernard Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
gabe_lewis No, I was not.
andy_bernard And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
dwight_schrute Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
kevin_malone Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
dwight_schrute No, Kevin, come on.
kevin_malone My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
dwight_schrute Kevin, not now.
kevin_malone Hey, Jo!
dwight_schrute Okay, okay. Shh!
kevin_malone No, under the jacket.
dwight_schrute You're kidding me. Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
kevin_malone I don't feel anything.
dwight_schrute Oh, it's so wet.
kevin_malone Push harder, Dwight.
dwight_schrute I can't. I can't push harder!
kevin_malone Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher.
dwight_schrute Okay, how's that?
kevin_malone Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
dwight_schrute I'm kneading it!
kevin_malone Don't eat it.
jo_bennett Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?
dwight_schrute Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
jo_bennett What?!
dwight_schrute I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
jo_bennett Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
dwight_schrute It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
jo_bennett Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
dwight_schrute I take full responsibility.
jo_bennett Who else would be responsible?
dwight_schrute Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
pam_beesly You shot a gun off -
dwight_schrute Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
jo_bennett Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
dwight_schrute Got it.
jo_bennett I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.
dwight_schrute Jo, please... I will -
jo_bennett No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.
jo_bennett You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
gabe_lewis Yep.
jim_halpert Yep.
jo_bennett Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?
toby_flenderson Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
jo_bennett Who is it?
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight. What's up?
dwight_schrute Shut up.
jim_halpert Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.
angela_martin Four, one, seven, one...
kevin_malone Another one?
darryl_philbin and Angela Yes!
angela_martin Seven, two...
oscar_martinez Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
angela_martin Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
darryl_philbin Nine first.
angela_martin Nine, eight, five...
kevin_malone Thank you.
angela_martin Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
kevin_malone Nice.
angela_martin Two, one...
kevin_malone Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
angela_martin God!
