erin_hannon They're back!
kevin_malone Oooh yeah... Jim and Pam!
kelly_kapoor How was Puerto Rico? Was it so romantic?
jim_halpert It was.
pam_beesly It really was.
jim_halpert Really was.
kelly_kapoor I'm so happy for you...
jim_halpert Puerto Rico was awesome.
pam_beesly Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.
jim_halpert Frank and Beans. Always makes her laugh.
pam_beesly Frank and beans!
michael_scott Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
dwight_schrute Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
michael_scott It is?
dwight_schrute Yeah...
michael_scott They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!
jim_halpert Nope.
michael_scott And oh, Jim...
pam_beesly Hi, Michael.
michael_scott Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
michael_scott Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him.
meredith_palmer So what'd you bring us?
pam_beesly Some candy.
meredith_palmer What else?
pam_beesly That's it.
meredith_palmer Oh, 'cause you spent so much on the wedding.
michael_scott
pam_beesly It's good to be home.
dwight_schrute This conversation has two items on the agenda.
jim_halpert Do we have a conversation scheduled?
dwight_schrute Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... con-quack-ulations!
jim_halpert Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.
dwight_schrute You're welcome!
dwight_schrute I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
dwight_schrute I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
jim_halpert It's a real handsome duck.
dwight_schrute Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
pam_beesly Hey!
erin_hannon Hi!
pam_beesly Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.
erin_hannon Coco Leche! That's my favorite!
pam_beesly Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
erin_hannon Oh, um, let me just check with Michael first.
pam_beesly I think it'll be okay.
erin_hannon I think it will too, but I'll just check with him, though.
pam_beesly Great.
erin_hannon Oops, sorry. Oops.
michael_scott I have recently taken a lover.
jim_halpert Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?
michael_scott Pam's mom.
jim_halpert What?
michael_scott Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
jim_halpert You're messing with me.
michael_scott About what?
jim_halpert You did not have s*x with Pam's mom.
michael_scott Oh, big time.
jim_halpert What kind of car does she drive?
michael_scott She drives a green camry.
jim_halpert
michael_scott And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
jim_halpert Oh my God. Oh my God.
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
michael_scott Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
jim_halpert Oh my God.
toby_flenderson Hey, Jim.
jim_halpert Not now, Toby, my God!
toby_flenderson Oh, Jesus!
michael_scott Get the hell out of here, idiot.
toby_flenderson What did I do?
jim_halpert Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.
michael_scott I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
jim_halpert No, not more than anything.
michael_scott Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
jim_halpert Don't call her "the mom."
michael_scott She's right on my way home from work.
jim_halpert Then take a different way home, man!
michael_scott I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
jim_halpert Okay, so we're good.
michael_scott Yeah.
michael_scott Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?
erin_hannon Sure. Oh, is it okay if I put out some candy that Pam brought back from Puerto Rico?
michael_scott Sure. Thanks for asking.
erin_hannon Pam, we're all set. Yum.
jim_halpert Frank and beans!
pam_beesly Frank and beans! So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?
jim_halpert You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
pam_beesly Bottle of rum it is. Alright, shall we?
jim_halpert You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.
pam_beesly Come on, it'll take two seconds.
jim_halpert No, it-
michael_scott Oh, wow.
pam_beesly
michael_scott That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
erin_hannon Michael, you're all set at Botticelli's. I changed the reservation to two people.
michael_scott Erin, look.
erin_hannon Fun!
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.
michael_scott Yeah, no, it's nobody.
pam_beesly I don't know. I think Michael has a date.
michael_scott Hmm... no.
pam_beesly I think you have a date.
michael_scott I don't.
pam_beesly Come on.
jim_halpert Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
michael_scott I don't deserve this, guys.
jim_halpert Yes, you do.
michael_scott No, I don't.
jim_halpert Just take the parrot.
michael_scott
jim_halpert Okay, back to the old grind.
michael_scott I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
pam_beesly Oh, that's too bad.
jim_halpert Don't-
michael_scott Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
jim_halpert Sounds complicated.
michael_scott It is.
pam_beesly Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.
michael_scott You want me to be happy?
pam_beesly Of course.
michael_scott Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
pam_beesly Oh.
michael_scott More than a friend, a co-worker.
pam_beesly Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?
michael_scott It's okay.
pam_beesly No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!
michael_scott That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.
pam_beesly
dwight_schrute You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
michael_scott Feels good.
dwight_schrute There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
michael_scott I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.
dwight_schrute ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
pam_beesly How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!
jim_halpert Who wants a hot chocolate?
pam_beesly Thank you.
jim_halpert Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
pam_beesly You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.
jim_halpert Andy, can I talk to you for a second?
andy_bernard Sure thing, Tuna Boss.
jim_halpert
andy_bernard How may I be of service to you?
jim_halpert I am gonna need your advice I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?
andy_bernard This aurea is a joke.
jim_halpert Really?
andy_bernard What are you thinking?
jim_halpert I was gonna go with this one.
andy_bernard Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
dwight_schrute The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
andy_bernard I know, right?
dwight_schrute What were you talking about in there?
andy_bernard Trust me it would only make you mad.
michael_scott Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.
andy_bernard Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?
michael_scott That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
pam_beesly Haha! Ha ha ha.
jim_halpert And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.
michael_scott Who wants to help the world one step at a time? Alright, good.
dwight_schrute Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
michael_scott Alright, that's...
meredith_palmer Paint a mural of Chicano leaders.
michael_scott Alright...
pam_beesly I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.
michael_scott Okay, I'm out of here, see you later guys...
Various#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode07 Get out and stay out, bye...
michael_scott Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation...
pam_beesly I love it, conservation. Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings. No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings! No more meetings!
michael_scott Anybody else? Who else has an idea?
angela_martin I have some ideas about conservation...
jim_halpert Yes! Angela! Please...
michael_scott Can you hold down the fort? Hey boo!
angela_martin Thank you. Sure well first of all I think that we could totally...
michael_scott What's it... why are you crying?
jim_halpert Yes! I think we should look into that. If you could just speak up louder...
kevin_malone Shhhh...
angela_martin Well, for our profit...
kevin_malone Shhh...
michael_scott No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle.
kevin_malone Who's pickle?
michael_scott Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
angela_martin I'm sorry, I was told I had the floor.
jim_halpert Yes.
oscar_martinez Hold on, hold on, what's going on?
jim_halpert Nothing... nothing at all... it's all good!
pam_beesly I'm not apologizing to anyone. Michael owes me an apology.
michael_scott For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
pam_beesly Don't call my mother your lover.
kevin_malone Yes! That's what I'm talking about.
andy_bernard That is not okay dude.
michael_scott Alright, in my defense...
phyllis_vance Disgusting...
creed_bratton She's messed up man...
pam_beesly Yes! Thank you, welcome to my personal hell!
oscar_martinez You have no sense of boundaries Michael.
michael_scott Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.
phyllis_vance Good luck Michael, I hope you find what you're looking for.
oscar_martinez Maybe you're right, who are we to...
pam_beesly Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
dwight_schrute I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
michael_scott Let's get back to the matter at hand.
pam_beesly Whatever, you know, sleep with my mom, sleep with everybody's mom...
michael_scott No, no, no... no, no...
ryan_howard Whoa, that's my mother you're talking about...
michael_scott I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
pam_beesly Uhh, huh, ho... oooh my God, you are ridiculous!
michael_scott Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
pam_beesly You are never going to be my father, you get out!
michael_scott I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...
pam_beesly Me too...
pam_beesly Hey.
oscar_martinez Hey.
angela_martin Pam, how's your day going?
oscar_martinez Pam, just for the record, I think you're overreacting a little bit, your mom's old enough to make her own decisions.
pam_beesly Oh, well, thanks Oscar. I was just wondering how would you feel if Michael was sleeping with your mom?
oscar_martinez My mother's in a wheelchair.
pam_beesly Well, he could still... I'm sorry about that... Oh could I just get you to sign this second page.
kelly_kapoor Ryan, I have to ask you a personal question. Do you think that I should get a Fedora?
ryan_howard Ahh, I don't think so, no...
kelly_kapoor Well, I think I'd look really hot in one. Where'd you get your fedora?
ryan_howard I'd rather not say.
kelly_kapoor I think I'm gonna get the same fedora as you.
erin_hannon Hi Dwight!
dwight_schrute Shh!
ryan_howard ...it should go with the persona you already have.
kelly_kapoor Well, I think I have that persona.
dwight_schrute Where did you get that mallard?
kelly_kapoor What the hell is a mallard?
dwight_schrute That!
kelly_kapoor Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
dwight_schrute Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
kelly_kapoor If you take it back, I'll scream.
dwight_schrute I'll give you five bucks for it.
ryan_howard Twenty.
dwight_schrute Ten.
ryan_howard Deal.
kelly_kapoor You're so cool.
ryan_howard This reminds me, you owe me three bucks for gas.
michael_scott Hey Toby, could I talk to you for a minute?
toby_flenderson Yeah, sure, what's up?
michael_scott Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.
toby_flenderson Um, yeah, ah, ah, that means a lot. Thank you for saying it.
michael_scott Can I sit down for a second?
toby_flenderson Yeah, er... pull up a chair or sit on the shredder.
michael_scott This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
toby_flenderson Ah, you should probably deal with that outside of the work place.
michael_scott She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
toby_flenderson Ok, I mean, I could talk to her.
michael_scott Really? Would you do that?
toby_flenderson Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.
michael_scott You're a good, good guy.
toby_flenderson I'm good...
toby_flenderson You know, I always knew if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we'd become friends.
toby_flenderson Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
pam_beesly Sure, what's up?
toby_flenderson Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
pam_beesly What's the matter, you can't fight your own battles?
michael_scott No... that's...
toby_flenderson Maybe you could just take the rest of the day off... you know...
pam_beesly Oh, would that make you feel better?
michael_scott I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.
pam_beesly You can tell Michael that I'm not leaving.
toby_flenderson Buddy, I think that...
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass. Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
stanley_hudson Heh, heh, heh.
pam_beesly Michael, you're just her rebound!
michael_scott You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
pam_beesly What! You knew?
jim_halpert Barely, I... I don't have all the facts. Frank and Bean...
michael_scott Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will.
pam_beesly Mmmmm, yes!
michael_scott Well, that is not gonna happen!
pam_beesly Then why'd you even offer!?
michael_scott Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
pam_beesly Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!
michael_scott You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
pam_beesly What's that supposed to mean?
michael_scott You know what it means.
jim_halpert Hey...
pam_beesly Shut it!
jim_halpert Yep...
michael_scott I don't need to be friends with Pam. I have plenty of female friends. My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt... although she just blocked me on IM, what's her face from Quiznos, I see her four times a week.
jim_halpert Dwight, you brought the mallard back.
dwight_schrute Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
jim_halpert Hi buddy.
dwight_schrute I'm sorry.
jim_halpert A wooden duck?
dwight_schrute Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
jim_halpert Okay, just to be clear, you're terrible at this and you are not equipped for espionage...
dwight_schrute Oh, I'm equipped... I can...
jim_halpert Silence.
dwight_schrute Don't tell Michael...
jim_halpert I won't. But, you will wash and buff our car.
dwight_schrute Punishment fits the crime, I accept.
michael_scott Night everyone. Night Pam, thanks again for the rum.
erin_hannon Night Michael.
michael_scott Night Erin.
jim_halpert Hey Pam, can I see you for a second? So, Dwight heard you were having a really rough day. So he generously offered to wash our car.
pam_beesly Awww, he did that for me?
jim_halpert Yes, he did. You know what was nice, nights swimming in Bayou bay.
pam_beesly Mmmm.
jim_halpert Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?
pam_beesly Haha, yeah. Say more nice things.
jim_halpert Well, we went on a Segway tour and we're awesome at it and Frank and Beans!
pam_beesly Maybe I'm overreacting.
jim_halpert Yeah... maybe.
pam_beesly But I don't think I am.
jim_halpert You're not, nope. Nope.
kevin_malone Oh... where'd you get that hat?
ryan_howard I'd rather not say.
dwight_schrute "We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..." I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane. "...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer."
