Michael  Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up. I ball the entire time. I can not watch Pixar.
Dwight Michael.
Michael Yes.
Dwight Drop this one. Abort.
Michael Why?
Dwight I found twins.
Michael Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
Dwight Aren't they magnificent?
Michael They're men, Dwight.
Dwight I love finding a good set of twins.
Michael Something is wrong with you.
Erin  Go Meredith. Nice moves.
Andy You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
Kelly Lame! What else you got, Andy?
Andy How about a little bit of this.
Erin Oh yeah. What else you got?
Kevin What else you got?
Andy Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo!
Erin What else you got?
Kevin It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. Pam?
Andy I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
Pam What?
Andy I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
Pam Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Andy Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here.
Pam  Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?
Jim  What?
Pam He tore his scrotum dancing.
Jim  What?
Pam He is in my room icing his balls.
Jim  What?
Pam Please stop saying what. Can you take him?
Jim Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
Pam Your brothers took you out drinking?
Jim Uh...
Michael  Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.
Pam That's Michael. You're out with Michael?
Jim  And Dwight.
Dwight  Hey-O!
Jim Pam, it just happened.
Pam Okay, fine. I'll take him.
Jim I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
Michael  I love you!
Pam Are you pushing me off the phone?
Jim No. Let's talk for a long time.
Pam Goodbye.
Michael Mmm! It's after midnight.
Michael and Dwight You're married. He's married!
Dwight Congratulations.
Jim That's not how that works.
Dwight Oh my goodness.
Michael Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.
Dwight You'll have Pam to answer to.
Michael She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons." "And... and clip my toenails."
Dwight "Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."
Michael Now you sound like Kermit.
Andy Are you sure this is the right way?
Pam Nope. I, like you, have never been here before.
Andy Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
Pam Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
Andy I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--
Pam My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job.
Andy Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
Andy  Ow, ow!
Andy  I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
Pam Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
Andy No. No that was real.
Michael  Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy?
Hotel Employee  Good morning. How can I help you?
Kevin I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Hotel Employee You must be Mr. Malone. One moment please.
Kevin Thank you.
Hotel Employee  Sir. It's the man with the shoes.
Hotel Manager Mr. Malone. Your shoes are gone.
Kevin They were stolen?
Hotel Manager No. Destroyed.
Kevin What?
Hotel Manager The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him. I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away. Incinerated actually.
Kevin But that was my only pair of shoes.
Hotel Manager It became a safety issue, sir.
Kevin Well... well damn-it.
Hotel Employee I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.
Kevin Okay.
Dwight  You have everything?
Isabel Hmm-hmm.
Dwight Cell phone? Charger?
Isabel Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day.
Dwight It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel.
Isabel That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding?
Dwight You know it.
Isabel K.
Dwight Okay, get out of here.
Isabel Bye.
Dwight Okay.
Michael  Hey, good morning. It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit.
Dwight  Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.
Michael  How can you eat like that?
Dwight I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?
Michael Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
Dwight Hey, what was she like?
Michael She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.
Dwight Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?
Michael She was from Europe.
Dwight No kidding.
Michael Uh-huh.
Dwight I bet she had hairy armpits.
Michael No.
Dwight Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
Michael Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?
Dwight No.
Michael She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?
Dwight Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.
Michael No... you're crazy.
Dwight Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.
Michael She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--
Dwight You should ask her out.
Michael  I already have my European girlfriend.
Stanley If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
Phyllis That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.
Angela  Oh my God.
Oscar Oh...
Kevin Oscar. Angela.
Erin Are you in a lot of pain?
Andy Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me.
Erin People say you cry all the time.
Andy Well that's not--
Meredith Crotch injuries are the worst. You don't need to tell me.
Andy I wasn't telling you.
Meredith Is there still something there?
Andy Excuse me?
Meredith It didn't get torn off?
Andy No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that?
Jim I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.
Erin If you want to sit on this-- I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged pen1s. Make it softer.
Andy It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you.
Michael Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.
Dwight I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
Penny Is it zipping over your belly? Don't squish the baby.
Pam Thank you weirdo.
Pam's mom everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom.
Pam Okay, here I come.
Pam's mom Oh darling! You look beautiful.
Pam Thanks mom.
Pam's mom Oh, I hope he deserves you.
Pam He does.
Pam's mom Are you sure? Remember you don't have to do this. You don't.
Penny Mom, you're totally projecting. You're being a drag.
Pam Yes. Thank you, mom.
Isabel Hey, I'm going to go outside and talk to Dwight.
Pam Okay great. Yeah, I'll see you in a second. Wait, what? Oh! Oh no!
Jim  Hey!
Pam Can you come here please?
Jim Is this allowed?
Pam No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here.
Dwight  That was an intelligent comment.
Isabel Hello stranger. How do I look?
Dwight Oh. Fine. Isabel, nice to see you. What do you want?
Isabel Um... nothing. Anymore.
Dwight  So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
Michael  Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?
Isabel I'm standing. I'm a bridesmaid.
Michael Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?
Pam Hey.
Jim Wow. You look--
Pam Terrible.
Jim So beautiful. Hey--
Pam My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
Jim  Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty.
Pam  Thank you.
Jim And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?
Pam No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and--
Jim There. Now we're even.
Pam  Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum. And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend. This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?
Phyllis I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife.
Angela Yes.
Oscar  What are you doing?
Kevin I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
Oscar How long do you take to pee?
Kevin The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on.
Michael  Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have--
Pam's mom Oh, yeah--
Michael Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
Pam's mom No.
Michael Oh... okay. Were you saving it?
Pam's mom Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I was just--I've had a very rough weekend.
Michael I'm sorry. Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.
Erin Do you think they canceled the wedding?
Angela Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
Michael my weekend was bad so far.
Pam's mom Oh--
Michael I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.
Pam's mom Oh that sounds awful.
Michael And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
Pam's mom Oh--
Michael It is a terrible year for love.
Pam's mom Yeah. Guess it is.
Michael I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
Tom Halpert Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?
Michel Um, yeah.
Tom Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.
Pete Halpert Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.
Michael Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually. There you go. Use it in good health.
Tom and Pete  Yes!
Meredith Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is the etiquette on taking the gifts? Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
Stanley Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
Kevin Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
Stanley No.
Kevin Who would want it?
Oscar Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
Dwight Toby.
Toby What?
Dwight I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
Toby
Dwight  Crap. Come here you.
Toby Well I guess this weddings not going to happen. I wonder if this is it for them.
Pam's dad Hey. What happened?
Ryan Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
Jim Well we are here now, so let's just--
Michael  Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?
Jim You look great.
Pam You look great.
Tom  Wear a tie much?
Penny  I begged them not to.
Pam Mm-hmm.
Penny I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list.
Pam Yes I did.
Penny I'm sorry.
Pam  Go ahead. I think it's your turn.
Penny Wait, what happened? You're okay with this?
Pam Yeah, I'm okay.
Penny Okay then!
Michael Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
Pam Saw it.
Jim I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.
Kevin What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking. Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel.
