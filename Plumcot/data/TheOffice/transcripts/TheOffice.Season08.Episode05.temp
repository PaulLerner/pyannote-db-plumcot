andy Approved!
andy Chef from South Park, it's genius!
stanley Just some chef.
andy I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
kevin The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
andy Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.
kevin It's been out for ages, man.
andy Costume vetoed.
andy Ah, it's, uh. somebody's already called that.
phyllis Who?
andy kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
kelly This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
andy Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just.
kelly Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. meredith wasn't even here.
meredith Because I was there. Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
andy I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
meredith What I said was, "My sister's funeral is this weekend. " Didn't say I'd be there.
meredith Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
andy Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?
erin Here you go.
andy There you go. Thank you.
erin When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
kevin Jim, put it on.
darryl Put it on, man.
jim I don't know if I can.
kevin Come on, the Three Amigos.
darryl Three Kings.
jim Alright.
jim I know, I know, I know. But darryl and kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
ryan If you get into season 1, you can really.
kelly Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
dwight It's called a costume.
kelly What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
dwight Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
ryan Whoopi Goldberg.
dwight Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
toby Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
andy Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just. wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
andy I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - "Boo!" Scared me. And then I got this text from robert California - "Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high. " Scared the s**t out of me.
andy G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
pam Yeah.
andy Australian accent.
pam What are you doing?
erin Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
pam Oh. Are you.
erin That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
pam Oh, Erin.
erin Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
pam Um, 2?
erin That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
pam No, I mean, you're doing great, and andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
erin Yeah.
pam Yeah.
erin Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
phyllis Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
oscar I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
pam Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
oscar What happened, Pam?
pam Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story.
phyllis Wait, they have food there?
pam . and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
jim No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
jim Hey.
pam Hey!
jim Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
pam What do you mean?
jim Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
pam I saw a ghost.
jim Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
pam It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
jim Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
pam I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
andy Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!
robert Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.
andy Yes.
robert Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is. a paper company.
bert Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane.
robert Here, use this one.
robert Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?
erin Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
bert That stuff's for babies.
robert Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.
andy Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
robert Extraordinary. Did you plan this?
kelly Well, toby and I did, yeah.
gabe And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
toby If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
kelly 1, 2, 3! Gabe/Kelly/
toby Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
robert Delightful.
kelly Thank you.
robert Now then, how are we today?
kelly Fine.
toby Great.
robert Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?
kelly Mmhmm.
robert You feeling fulfilled in your life?
kelly I guess.
robert You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.
kelly I try not to think about it.
robert Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?
kelly Never marrying.
robert Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?
toby So great.
erin Oh, I put those up.
angela I know. I'm taking them down.
phyllis I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
erin I don't know about this, guys, andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so.
angela Well, andy sent us in here, so which is it?
erin Oh.
angela So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
bert Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm.
dwight Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
bert What are you, anyway?
dwight I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
bert If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft.
dwight Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
bert If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl.
dwight Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
bert Yeah, she also has boobs.
dwight Yeah, but no nipples.
erin Hey.
andy Hey. What's up?
erin November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
andy Yeah.
erin Hey, what's the jive with angela and phyllis helping with the party, you know?
andy Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
erin But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
andy Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
erin Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
andy Yes. I don't know. Mmhmm. . push;
erin Gabe?
gabe Sweetheart.
erin I'm throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz.
gabe Ok where does gabe factor in?
erin Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn't stop crying?
gabe Yes. Lars and Decocco's
erin Ok. Let's say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just. more adult. more. scary and sexy
gabe I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
erin No â€“ just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
gabe Oh that would be scary!
erin What are you thinking?
gabe Ok let me go get it.
pam pam Halpert.
jim Hey it's jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I've read a lot about this really great documentary.
pam Is it called Ghostbusters?
jim It's called Ghostbusters.
pam It didn't look like that.
jim It didn't have a buster sign around him? Why don't you draw him? Why don't we see this whole thing.
pam Ok fine I'll draw him.
jim I ain't fraid of no ghost. Whoa!
pam Mmhmm. dwight are you eating a stick?
dwight It's a root you idiot.
bert Everyone hates you.
dwight That's really rude. I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.
bert What do you like? Tornadoes?
dwight Try influenza.
bert Oh yeah? What's the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?
dwight Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane's coming. I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
bert Try a box jelly fish.
jim You know that's.
robert What are we talking about?
jim I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and meredith said she believes in them too.
robert You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don't scare you?
kevin I'm only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don't exist like ghosts or mummies.
oscar Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums.
kevin Yeah . prank
robert It's true. They've been preserved for thousands of years. They're all over.
kevin Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
erin Witch's brew?
erin I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh!
jim Party looks fun doesn't it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
bert I'm using it. I'm about to play Starcraft with him .
jim Are you serious?
dwight Yeah I'm serious.
jim That's funny. Ok.
dwight Loser.
bert Yeah.
angela pam do you think anyone's going to notice I've worn this costume before? When I wasn't pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
oscar Hey guys. I'm an oscar liar weiner.
ryan Oh my god!
darryl This party's tight. The fog is cool.
erin Thanks. It's on medium.
darryl Perfect.
andy It really looks great. You did a great job.
erin Oh, so we don't have to have that talk.
andy We should still have that talk. Maybe you can come by my office at like 4
 45? Cool.
erin Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok.
gabe The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
oscar Is that my grandmother?
andy What's the story?
oscar There is no story.
gabe Yeah it seems like there isn't a narrative. Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
stanley What the hell is going on here?
andy I think we've seen enough. You can turn it off now. Yeah turn it off now.
stanley How did you get in my car?
oscar Where is this from? That is so upsetting!
andy That was awful. robert I apologize.
erin I'm sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now . This game is called "pecker Poker". It's the game of cards that gets you hard.
andy What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
robert Why didn't you simply ask andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. You're obviously very close. . Oh I see. This no longer seems like my business .
erin All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so.
robert You were going to talk at the end of the. I'm not here.
andy Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn't. I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
robert I'm never uncomfortable.
andy Ok. erin I think you know I've been dating someone.
erin Sure.
andy And it's getting a little more serious. She's never come by.
erin And she's never called here. Unless it's your mom.
andy No I didn't want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it's weird that she's not calling.
erin Two dates? Three dates?
andy Thirty-one.
erin Wow. I'm so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I'll see you guys.
robert I should go.
darryl I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
jim Thank you.
pam jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
jim Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
pam Really.
jim No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not.
kevin Exactly.
jim Thank you.
dwight Go, get up there right now.
bert Got it.
darryl Dwight?
dwight You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
bert Unleash the hellstorm.
darryl Dwight.
dwight Nice.
darryl Dwight!
dwight Got 'em. Go!
phyllis Is she Asian?
erin I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
phyllis Forest? Did andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
erin I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
phyllis Hmm.
robert Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?
creed No.
robert Are you scared of snakes?
creed You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
darryl [in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
meredith Honestly, jim gives me the creeps.
robert What am I up to?
jim Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, "Mom, there's a ghost in my closet. " Now, you say one of two things - one, "You're just having a bad dream, " or two, "Let's go see what it was. "
pam I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim.
jim Ok.
pam I'm not gonna lie to her, either.
jim Oh, come on!
robert When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.
creed Oh my goodness.
robert The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.
kevin Nooo!
robert Amongst them was a man, tall, slim.
meredith Jim.
robert Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. "Oh, wait, " she thought, "I don't have a husband. " For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, "Baby, are you okay?" Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, "I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine. "
bert 
robert Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.
bert Toby?
toby Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry.
bert You're fired.
toby . bones. What?
bert You heard me. Pack your things.
toby What. you can't. Gabe? Are you.
bert I'm the CEO's son. Pack your things. You're done.
