michael_scott Hello son. If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead. Life is a road---
dwight_schrute How do you know it's going to be a boy?
michael_scott How, would you stop interrupting please?
michael_scott Yesterday I was scraping some gunk off my wall sockets with a metal fork and I gave myself the nastiest shock. And when I came to, I had an epiphery. Life is precious. And if I die I want my son to know the dealio. The dealio of life.
michael_scott Here are some things that I want to teach you that your mother won't be able to.
michael_scott To jump start a car, first pop the hood. Then you take these bad boys and clip them anywhere on the engine. Then you take these and clip them wherever.
dwight_schrute
michael_scott Number eight, learn how to take off a woman's bra.
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott We will demonstrate on Pam.
pam_beesly No. No.
michael_scott Come on.
michael_scott You just twist your hand until something breaks.
dwight_schrute Ow.
michael_scott Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.
michael_scott And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
dwight_schrute What if he's a murderer?
michael_scott He's not going to be a murderer.
dwight_schrute Maybe that's how you die.
michael_scott You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
dwight_schrute I want to do this.
michael_scott Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-
dwight_schrute Action.
michael_scott Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta.
jim_halpert Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So...
michael_scott I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
michael_scott I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat.
michael_scott What's up spinsters?
angela_martin Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only.
michael_scott No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2 30 to 3 15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys.
karen_filippelli I guess Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch for the past couple weeks but we had some really good talks and actually now I think that we're better than ever.
jim_halpert Karen and I had a long talk last night and the night before that and uh, every night, for the last five nights.
pam_beesly Something's up with Jim and Karen. Not that I've been eavesdropping. It's not really any of my business, but I've gotten pretty good at reading the back of Jim's neck.
todd_packer Halpert! Tall, queer, handsome as ever. Hey everybody it's me, Jim. Hello, hello. Todd Packer.
karen_filippelli Karen Fillipelli. Jim's girlfriend.
todd_packer Shut up!
karen_filippelli Yep.
todd_packer Shut it!
karen_filippelli That's rude.
todd_packer Either this chick is a dude or Halpert got scared straight!
michael_scott Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh!
todd_packer What happened?
michael_scott Oh God-
todd_packer Quick somebody help! Help the man!
michael_scott No, no, no!
michael_scott I can't believe you're not going to be there. It's going to be good, it's going to be a great bachelor party man.
todd_packer I have a full day of sales calls.
michael_scott You should get out of them.
todd_packer
michael_scott It's the only time he can do it. 2 30 to 3 15. It's going to be great. We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie. Going to be very delicious.
todd_packer And what kind of stripper did you get?
michael_scott I did not order a stripper.
todd_packer You didn't order a stripper? Have you ever even been to a bachelor party?
michael_scott Um, not personally, no.
todd_packer Mike, okay, a stripper is bachelor party 101. If you don't get a stripper your party is going to suck it hard.
michael_scott I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment.
todd_packer Just get one for the girls too. That evens it out. You know, separate but equal.
michael_scott So that's what that means.
michael_scott Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!
dwight_schrute Alright! Uh!
michael_scott Gay.
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies.
angela_martin Under no circumstance should a man strip off his clothes in this office.
meredith_palmer SHUT UP ANGELA!
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Ugh.
jim_halpert Ugh.
pam_beesly Everything okay?
jim_halpert Oh yeah. Why?
pam_beesly Well you seem a little tired.
jim_halpert Oh. Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
pam_beesly You should get more sleep.
jim_halpert Yeah, I know I should.
pam_beesly Never underestimate the power of a good night's sleep.
jim_halpert No, I'm sure you're right.
pam_beesly When I get eight hours, compared to like six hours, like, big difference.
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly Oh yeah. Gotta get your REM cycle going with the whole sleeping. Better than not.
jim_halpert Good advice Beesley. Thanks. See you out there.
pam_beesly Yeah. Don't fall asleep at your desk. Oh my God.
michael_scott Okay. We are off. Ryan and I are going to go get some supplies and I need you to handle hiring the strippers.
jim_halpert Absolutely not.
dwight_schrute I'm on it.
michael_scott Well get on it. And make it happen.
dwight_schrute Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want-
jim_halpert Stop. That's disgusting.
dwight_schrute Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
jim_halpert Fine.
dwight_schrute I knew you would, Nancy.
jim_halpert Sally.
dwight_schrute No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
jim_halpert Blonde.
dwight_schrute Nice. Do you have any blonde women?
michael_scott
ryan_howard He hasn't even said a word yet. Just giggling.
michael_scott Gotcha, oh! Yes?
jim_halpert Are you okay?
michael_scott I'm in the, I'm in the s*x shop.
jim_halpert Ah, gotcha. Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
michael_scott Squarepants?
jim_halpert Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
michael_scott And you think that'd be sexy?
jim_halpert Michael referred me to a male strip club called Banana Slings. Instead, I called the Scholastic Speakers of Pennsylvania.
ben_franklin Franklin Hold the door please!
michael_scott Oh.
ben_franklin Franklin Thank you.
michael_scott Oh. Hello!
ben_franklin Franklin Hello!
michael_scott You wearing a thong?
ben_franklin Franklin What?
angela_martin Sparkling cider is very good.
pam_beesly I think that's champagne.
angela_martin
michael_scott Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
ben_franklin Franklin Thank you for that introduction, Mr. Scott, and good afternoon fine gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin.
michael_scott Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
ben_franklin Franklin Knickers in fact, yes!
michael_scott He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
ben_franklin Franklin Well, actually, I never was president.
michael_scott Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
ben_franklin Franklin Ah. I'm here to teach you a little bit about my life and the era of the founding fathers.
michael_scott And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow.
meredith_palmer Wait, this is the entertainment?
michael_scott Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one.
jim_halpert Have you ever seen a stripper before?
dwight_schrute Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.
jim_halpert Yeah, me neither.
elizabeth_the_stripper Hey.
jim_halpert Hi.
elizabeth_the_stripper I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested.
dwight_schrute Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
elizabeth_the_stripper I'm the stripper.
dwight_schrute Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
jim_halpert Oh God.
dwight_schrute Is she hot? Text back, "Kind of."
ben_franklin Franklin It was a warm June evening in 1752, the night of my fateful kite flight.
karen_filippelli Mr. Franklin?
ben_franklin Franklin Yes?
karen_filippelli Do you have a girlfriend?
ben_franklin Franklin I have a lovely wife, Deborah.
pam_beesly But don't you also have girlfriends in Paris? Like a lot of them?
ben_franklin Franklin Uh, well that is a grey area of my life. Okay? So, it was a warm June evening.
michael_scott Look at that. Nothing like grilling in the great outdoors.
ryan_howard Is this the same grill you grilled your foot on?
michael_scott No. Yes.
ryan_howard Oh gross.
michael_scott But I got all the foot off of it.
pam_beesly Okay Ben Franklin!
karen_filippelli Ben Franklin tied a cherry stem with his mouth!
ben_franklin Franklin Well, that is because I am a renaissance man.
pam_beesly Ben Franklin, do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons?
ben_franklin Franklin Well, you're very saucy!
michael_scott Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?
dwight_schrute I do! I want some man meat!
jim_halpert Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
michael_scott Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity.
stanley_hudson Of course.
karen_filippelli So I guess you have the Ben Franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?
pam_beesly Well I like to think that his dad was a Ben Franklin impersonator and he really pressured him into it.
karen_filippelli Hey um, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but Jim told me about you guys.
pam_beesly What do you mean?
karen_filippelli Well that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal. It's just a kiss. Wait- you're not still interested in him?
pam_beesly Oh yeah.
karen_filippelli Really?
pam_beesly Oh no, I was confused by your phrasing. You should definitely go out with Jim. I mean, you're going out with Jim. I'm not going out with Jim. You're dating him, which is awesome, because you guys are great together.
karen_filippelli Okay.
pam_beesly I'm not into Jim. Yeah.
karen_filippelli So um, well good.
pam_beesly Yeah. Sorry.
karen_filippelli What are you sorry about?
pam_beesly Um, what?
karen_filippelli What are you sorry about?
pam_beesly Nothing. I was just thinking of something else.
kevin_malone Okay. The game is no limit deuce to seven lowball. Lines twenty five fifty, nickels are worth ten, dimes twenty-five, and quarters fifty. Nothing wild.
michael_scott I call shuffle. Here we go.
kevin_malone Michael.
michael_scott Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
elizabeth_the_stripper Hi guys!
michael_scott Nice outfit.
elizabeth_the_stripper I hear there's an important meeting here.
roy_anderson I'm not really into strippers. You know what I find sexy? Pam's art. She's an artist and I appreciate that. It's very moving and sexy. The art.
elizabeth_the_stripper Hit it. So where's the groom?
michael_scott He's right there. There he is.
bob_vance Vance Absolutely not. That's all you. That's all you.
michael_scott Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I?
elizabeth_the_stripper Just sit on down.
michael_scott Alright.
elizabeth_the_stripper Alright.
michael_scott Okay.
elizabeth_the_stripper Here we go.
michael_scott Here we go. Alright!
elizabeth_the_stripper Yeah!
michael_scott Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide.
elizabeth_the_stripper Mmm, what's that?
michael_scott You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so...
elizabeth_the_stripper I bet she'd be jealous.
michael_scott Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!
dwight_schrute Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it.
elizabeth_the_stripper You want me to answer phones with my clothes on.
dwight_schrute We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
elizabeth_the_stripper Oh I love your poster.
angela_martin Thank you.
kevin_malone
ben_franklin Franklin You know I invented electricity.
pam_beesly I know.
ben_franklin Franklin Well I'm sensing a little electricity right here.
pam_beesly Didn't Ben Franklin have syphilis?
ben_franklin Franklin Yes, but I don't. My name is Gordon.
pam_beesly Ohhh.
michael_scott On one hand I want to be honest with Jan and tell her the truth but on the other hand I'm afraid she's going to dump me.
ben_franklin Franklin You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.
michael_scott Really.
ben_franklin Franklin But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler s*x.
michael_scott Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.
michael_scott Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
elizabeth_the_stripper Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone.
michael_scott Wow. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Care for a piece of chocolate?
ben_franklin Franklin Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States.
dwight_schrute Who is the king of Austria?
ben_franklin Franklin Joseph the 2nd.
dwight_schrute Who is the king of Prussia?
ben_franklin Franklin Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd.
dwight_schrute Who is the king of England?
ben_franklin Franklin Why the tyrant King George, of course!
dwight_schrute I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure.
jan_levinson Michael, I left a meeting. What is so urgent? Are you, are you okay?
michael_scott Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
jan_levinson Okay.
michael_scott I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
jan_levinson Uh when, when did, when last night?
michael_scott No, today at work.
jan_levinson You went to a bachelor party at work?
michael_scott Yes. I kind of arranged it.
kelly_kapoor Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot?
ryan_howard Kelly don't do this.
kelly_kapoor Do what? I just asked you a question.
ryan_howard You know what you're doing.
kelly_kapoor Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam.
jim_halpert Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley?
pam_beesly Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever.
ryan_howard Ok.
elizabeth_the_stripper Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here.
pam_beesly Yeah? I lose my appetite all the time.
elizabeth_the_stripper You could strip you know.
pam_beesly Thanks.
michael_scott So you don't want to end our relationship?
jan_levinson I'm closer to firing you.
michael_scott That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?
jan_levinson I'll talk to you later.
michael_scott You are. You are.
michael_scott So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.
dwight_schrute Are you near sighted or far sighted?
ben_franklin Franklin Both. That's why I invented the bifocal.
dwight_schrute GAH!!!
