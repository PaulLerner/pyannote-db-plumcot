michael_scott Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
oscar_martinez Yes.
michael_scott Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.
michael_scott Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
darryl_philbin Hey, are we doing this thing?
michael_scott Yup.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
michael_scott Why are you dressed like that?
darryl_philbin Like what?
michael_scott Like you're applying for a loan.
dwight_schrute Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
darryl_philbin Figured I look presentable. You? Went a different way.
pam_beesly I think you look nice.
michael_scott and Darryl Thank you.
michael_scott Okay, here's what we're going to do I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.
darryl_philbin What college did you go to Mike?
michael_scott Let's go!
jim_halpert Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try.
phil_maguire Maguire Whoa!
jim_halpert Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.
phil_maguire Maguire Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man.
andy_bernard Oh no! No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir. I am... totally and completely kidding! Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95.
phil_maguire Maguire Phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74
andy_bernard Oop, got some blisties.
phil_maguire Maguire Yeah, you do.
andy_bernard Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
phil_maguire Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
jim_halpert Great!
kevin_malone What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
kevin_malone I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
pam_beesly So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
michael_scott A little over the top, don't you think?
darryl_philbin Show them what you brought, Mike.
pam_beesly Um, that's all we brought.
michael_scott This is all we need.
oscar_martinez We'll see.
michael_scott Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! Hello!
kevin_malone Andy, you're up, let's go!
andy_bernard Giddy up, let's do this.
andy_bernard People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my "knot" on.
andy_bernard Dammit!
meredith_palmer Guys, do we have to stay all day?
phyllis_vance I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
creed_bratton Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
dwight_schrute Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
phyllis_vance What consequences?
dwight_schrute I will tell on you.
pam_beesly There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we... uh, eat a lot of cake!
justin_polznik Cool.
pam_beesly Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
michael_scott Hello. Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
pam_beesly This is Michael, my boss. Justin.
michael_scott Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest."
pam_beesly He's nice and he seems interested.
michael_scott He's totally wrong, Pam. Hey.
justin_polznik Hi.
michael_scott How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
justin_polznik Sorry for wasting your time.
michael_scott Oh, no problem. And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
darryl_philbin Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
pam_beesly I only brought the one.
michael_scott Are you mental?
pam_beesly Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure Michael?" And you said "Pam! Pam! Pam!" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, "Don't worry, it's just allergies." Do you remember that?
michael_scott I... don't.
pam_beesly Okay. I'll go look for another one.
michael_scott And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
jim_halpert Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
phil_maguire I can't complain, people love their junk mail.
jim_halpert Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
phil_maguire You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay?
jim_halpert Absolutely, will do.
jim_halpert So I guess I'll just... work on my short game.
michael_scott Hello there.
Kid#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 What is this company?
michael_scott Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
oscar_martinez Dunder Mifflin paper.
Kid#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 Thanks.
michael_scott Dammit, Oscar!
michael_scott Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline!
dwight_schrute Thank you.
angela_martin Extension 128.
creed_bratton Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.
creed_bratton Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
angela_martin No.
creed_bratton Are you out? Pumpkin's out, let's go gang!
pam_beesly My old art room. Oh, maybe it's still here! No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
michael_scott What do you want?
dwight_schrute Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
michael_scott Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
dwight_schrute So... what else is up? Mich-
michael_scott Thank you! What, what is this?
pam_beesly A piece of paper.
michael_scott This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
pam_beesly Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
michael_scott Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
pam_beesly Are you serious?
michael_scott Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
pam_beesly Okay.
phil_maguire Oh! Ah, dammit!
jim_halpert You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
phil_maguire Yeah I'll- I'll get it out. Thank you.
jim_halpert Yep.
angela_martin and Dwight
andy_bernard AH! Come on, Tuna!
jim_halpert Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
pam_beesly Just checking in, how's it going?
jim_halpert Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
pam_beesly I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get Michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
jim_halpert Oh, I like you.
pam_beesly Talk to you later?
jim_halpert Yeah. All right. Bye. All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
phil_maguire You can try. But I've looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn't work. It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim. Six.
kevin_malone Yeah.
andy_bernard All right, race to the next hole!
kevin_malone Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
andy_bernard Shortcut! Shortcut! Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
dwight_schrute
michael_scott All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
michael_scott Hey! Game over.
michael_scott Just-in time.
justin_polznik Hi.
michael_scott Just-in case. What's your last name?
justin_polznik Polznik.
michael_scott This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
michael_scott Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most... important thing in my life right now.
michael_scott I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
oscar_martinez Hey.
justin_polznik Hi.
michael_scott This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you. No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
pam_beesly Excuse me.
michael_scott Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
oscar_martinez Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
michael_scott So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
justin_polznik You didn't want me before. That's what you said.
michael_scott No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
justin_polznik You were kind of a jerk to me.
michael_scott I, uh, hmm.
justin_polznik And I'm, I'm gonna go now.
michael_scott Why don't... hey.
andy_bernard
dwight_schrute Ah-choo!
angela_martin Bless you.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
kevin_malone Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
phil_maguire Let's open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often.
andy_bernard Count me in!
phil_maguire No.
andy_bernard All right!
jim_halpert Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
phil_maguire I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good?
jim_halpert Absolutely.
Maguire#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 Good playing with you guys.
andy_bernard Right on.
jim_halpert You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 on mic The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.
michael_scott Hold down the fort, I have to do something. Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
angela_martin Thank you.
dwight_schrute You're welcome.
pam_beesly Beers? You closed it?
jim_halpert I closed it!
pam_beesly Yes! Oh! Um, congratulations to you, sir.
jim_halpert Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
pam_beesly Well done.
jim_halpert Thank you. You know what, screw this!
kevin_malone Oooh!
michael_scott Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
michael_scott Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.
pam_beesly Hi.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy Hello.
pam_beesly I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy Are you interested in graphic design?
pam_beesly Yeah. Can I fill out an application?
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.
pam_beesly I can do that.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.
pam_beesly I don't know any of those.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy It's actually not super-complicated. I mean I'm sure there's some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they've got amazing programs out there for design.
pam_beesly New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy Yeah.
pam_beesly All right. Cool, well... thanks.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy Sure.
pam_beesly And uh, I'll look into those.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy You should.
pam_beesly New York or Philadelphia.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy Absolutely.
pam_beesly Okay.
Graphics#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode13 guy It's where the action is.
pam_beesly Thanks.
