michael David!
david Oh, Michael?
michael Are we all set?
david Isn't our interview tomorrow?
michael Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
david You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
michael Thought I'd catch a show.
david In the middle of a work day?
michael Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
david Okay.
michael Um, how many people are you interviewing?
david We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
michael Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
david I don't think so.
michael Great. One more. question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
david I believe we put you in charge.
michael Ah, great. No further questions.
david Okay, Michael.
michael Okay.
david I'm really looking forward to our interview.
michael And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
michael I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. Hey, pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
kevin Hey.
jim Hey, Kev.
kevin What's different about you? You look worse.
jim Thank you.
meredith You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
jim Ohhh.
meredith Turn around.
jim No.
meredith Yes.
jim No way.
meredith Do it!
andy Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
jim Andy.
andy What is it, Big Haircut?
jim Nothing.
andy Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.
jim Yup.
andy What?
jim karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
pam Hey. I think it looks great.
jim Thanks, Pam.
pam After I had my little outburst at the beach, jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so thank you.
michael Yeah.
dwight You wanted to see me?
michael Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to dwight K. Schrute.
dwight But that's my name. Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. Thank you.
michael Okay. Uh.
dwight Thank you, Michael.
michael Uh, okay.
dwight Thank you so much.
michael Stop crying.
dwight Thank you.
michael Ohhhhh.
pam Hey.
karen Hey.
pam Um, about the beach.
karen It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
pam Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just. I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
karen Oh. Okay.
karen pam is. kind of a bitch.
karen Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
jim Ahhh. just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
jim So I was wondering if karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
michael Why so you can do it?
karen 
jim Whoops.
michael No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger.
jim Hmmm.
karen Heh.
michael Moon each other.
jim Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
michael All right.
jim All right.
michael Your loss.
karen Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
michael Cruise control.
karen Oh.
kevin So Jim, who do you think is hotter? pam or Karen?
jim Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
kevin pam is taller.
jim You sure?
kevin Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
jim Wow.
kevin I think karen has a prettier face.
jim Uh, hmm. Uh, hmm. What else?
kevin Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
jim Hm. Really tough call.
kevin Yeah.
jim You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
kevin Will do.
jim All right.
oscar Hey, pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship.
pam Wow, very funny.
stanley I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
kelly Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
pam 
meredith You know what? Don't even worry about it. everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
creed I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
creed www. creedthoughts. gov. www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
ryan Last year creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's. pretty shocking.
michael There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
kevin Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with jan in New York?
michael No. Not at all. I haven't talked to jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
oscar Maybe you should talk to her? Before.
michael No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
oscar Michael.
kevin What?
angela Why?
oscar I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
michael Yes, I.
angela Wha? Who gave you that advice?
kevin Yeah, michael you should never sell your condo.
michael I have to buy another place.
angela But you said you were in debt.
oscar You're not sure that you have the job.
michael I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.
dwight How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
angela No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
dwight No, no, not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job.
angela Not now. Goodbye, kelly Kapoor.
dwight Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
jim Oh hey, Dwight.
dwight I am gonna be your new boss. It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.
jim Does my room have cable?
dwight No. And the sheets are made of fire.
jim Can I change rooms?
dwight Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
jim Can I have a late checkout?
dwight I'll have to talk to the manager.
jim You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
dwight I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!
jim Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
dwight Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
jim Go.
dwight Eighty thousand dollars a year.
dwight Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
andy I will see you at the inter-view.
dwight Yes you will.
michael Who is D. Abramson?
pam He's from that company in Pitts.
jan Michael.
michael Why. are you here?
jan Uh, how are you?
michael I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
jan I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk. privately. for a minute?
michael Why privately?
jan I just, I uh. I don't uh. I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
michael Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
jan Okay.
michael Okay.
michael Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
pam What do you want me to do?
michael Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
pam What about Meredith?
michael No. She's an alternate.
michael So, how you been?
jan Been good.
michael Good.
jan Good.
michael Yeah.
jan Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
michael Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
pam So, um, michael needs us in the conference room.
karen 'Cause of jan again?
karen Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
pam Uh, sure.
karen Thanks.
pam I really hope you get the job.
karen Thanks.
jan After you ended. everything with us, I went on a vacation.
michael Hmm.
jan To kinda clear my mind.
michael Sound good. Sounds fun.
jan It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
michael Hmm.
jan I've made some big changes in my life and. I miss you. I want us to get back together.
michael Would you excuse me for a second?
jan Ohh.
michael Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.
phyllis What are you gonna do?
michael I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please.
karen Do you want to get back together with her?
michael No, no. What do I do?
pam Just don't get back together with her.
michael What if she makes me?
angela How can she make you get back together with her?
michael She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
pam This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
michael I wasn't.
pam You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
michael You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
pam Right.
michael Wow.
karen Do it.
michael I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
michael Okay. Jan, we need to talk.
michael jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
pam Oh my God. Huge!
jim Yeah, bigger actually.
pam That's crazy!
jim Mm-hm.
pam Wow!
karen Oh my God. Can you believe that?
jim Unbelievable.
karen Wow!
jim She could put the cup right there.
karen I know!
pam No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for jim when Roy and I were joking around. that one time.
meredith I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
kevin I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers.
creed I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots.
jan So. there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
michael Yeah.
jan I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
michael First got priorities.
jan And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation.
michael Let's get back together.
michael No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is. emotionally magnificent.
dwight Okay, everyone, listen up! Time to begin the interview process! Andrew Bernard.
andy Saving the best for first!
karen All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck!
dwight No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael.
oscar Good luck, you guys!
dwight What did I say!?
pam Good luck.
jim Thanks.
pam I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. That's Popeye.
dwight I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?
andy White, because it contains all other colors.
dwight Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?
andy You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
dwight What is the capital of Maine?
andy The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
dwight Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
andy Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
dwight You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
andy I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
andy I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else
has my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
dwight Time! No, you failed.
andy Damn it!
dwight This interview is over. I'll let you know.
karen Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
jim Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or.
karen Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
jim Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named karen too? What did she accomplish?
karen No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
jim Oh.
karen 'Cause I'm going to get the job. . push;
michael Remarkable.
jan Thanks.
michael Wait, wait. Check one more time.
jan Oh, okay.
michael Very good
jan Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
michael Yes, indeed.
jan Good luck with your interview. Bye.
michael So, I guess we're getting back together.
pam What happened?
michael Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
michael Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery.
karen So we have all night. Where do you want to go first?
jim Oh, I dunno, how about the U. N. ?
karen How often do you come here?
jim Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
karen I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
michael Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, I would like to start saying my goodbyes Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
dwight Who's ready to work?
jim Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
karen That wasn't him.
karen So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
jim Oh do you mean when I get the job?
karen Well, if you get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there.
jim You mean Kevin?
karen Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
jim Yeah, I do. C'mon.
michael How are you guys doing? Need anything?
karen Uh, no, we're good. Thanks.
michael I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
jim Who's that?
michael That is Beardy.
jim Beardy?
michael Mm-hmm.
jim I'm gonna introduce myself.
michael No, no, no, just. that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so.
michael I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. jim and karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy. is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.
dwight michael is gone.
andy Hail to the chief!
dwight My first order of
business make Andrew Bernard my number two.
andy My first order of
business accept.
dwight As if you had a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime.
andy Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad.
michael Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
hunter Uh, administrative assistant.
michael jan in yet?
hunter I think she's comin' in. later.
michael Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
hunter Sure.
michael Just say, "I want to squeeze them. " It's code. She'll know what it means.
hunter Okay.
michael Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
dwight You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
pam Thank you.
dwight I had to make andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you. to be Assistant Regional Manager.
pam Really?
dwight Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
pam You will be your own assistant.
dwight Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title. to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
pam Okay. So. you would be the Regional Manager, and the Assistant Regional Manager. andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager.
dwight Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.
pam Mm-hmm.
dwight Do you accept?
pam Absolutely, I do.
pam I learned from Jim, if dwight ever asks you to accept something secret. you reply, "Absolutely, I do. "
michael Hello, hello!
david Michael, good to see you!
michael Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
david Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work. So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
michael Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
david Okay. And your strengths?
michael Well, my weaknesses are actually. strengths.
david Oh. Yes. Very good.
michael Thank you.
david Very good.
phyllis dwight is our new boss.
oscar Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
pam Then who do you think will get the job?
kevin Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits.
phyllis I think it's gonna be Michael.
oscar Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
phyllis No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
oscar Mm. Yeah.
dwight Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This. is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks. equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
pam What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
dwight Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent.
oscar So ten thousand of your dollars is worth one real dollar?
dwight Just. zip your lid! Another announcement. michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!
stanley Amen.
dwight Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
kevin Do we have to?
dwight Yes! michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me. " Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!
pam I literally cannot wait to see what dwight has planned. And I wish jim were here.
david What do you think we could be doing better?
michael I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper. " I don't know, something like that.
david Okay!
michael Okay.
david Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
michael Thank you.
david It is always a treat when our paths cross.
michael It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, jan and I are back together. So. I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.
david You're back together.
michael Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her. or on top of her. Mm, that's not sexual, just. we're all professionals.
david Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position. the job you're applying for. is Jan's job.
michael I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
david No, we're letting jan go.
dwight Listen up. Let's start. from the ground up. Where does paper come from?
kevin Trees.
dwight Trees! And where do trees grow?
kevin Forest.
dwight Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say. is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous. state?
stanley Liquid.
dwight Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.
stanley I don't want it.
dwight Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
stanley Make it 100.
dwight We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
stanley No. In fact, I'll give you a billion stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
dwight What's the ratio of stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
stanley The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
dwight Okay---
andy That's it!
dwight What---
andy Class is canceled, everybody out!
dwight No wait, what are you doing?!
andy I'm punishing them.
dwight No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled.
everyone 
pam HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation!
oscar What--- What are you winking for?
dwight Zip your lid!
karen So, that's. my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows?
david Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but.
karen Yeah?
david . what do you think about michael Scott?
karen He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
david This is off the record.
karen He would be disaster.
jan Hey you!
michael Hey.
jan How was your interview?
michael Pretty good.
jan Yeah?
michael Could have gone better I guess.
jan Oh. I'll put in a good word for you.
michael Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
jan What?
michael Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would. be fine. We'd have fun.
jan What's. what's the matter? What. what happened in there?
michael I can't tell you.
jan Tell me what?
jan You son of a bitch!
david Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
jan You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
david Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
jan Erratic?
david Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
jan Is it because of these?
michael Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
jan No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
david It's not.
jan No?
david It's not.
jan 'Cause he likes them. Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
david The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable.
michael Hey! You're unstable!
jan Yeah!
michael No--- We're all unstable.
jan Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving.
michael David, I did not tell her.
andy It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
dwight It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black.
andy This is gonna look so awesome!
dwight It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here. is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
andy Totally!
jan Bye Hunter.
hunter Bye.
jan Good luck with your band.
hunter Oh, thank---
jan Don't let them change you, okay? So long, .
michael So, I am gonna. give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.
david Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
michael Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
david No, we're not giving you the job.
michael You know what? That. is actually good. because, um, I don't think I could take. my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?
david I do.
michael Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.
david Yes.
michael Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two. Either one of them. excellent candidates.
karen Wow. That was some serious. hardcore. self destruction.
jim Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though.
karen Don't! She's nuts!
jim Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
karen Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so.
jim Okay.
karen Just call me when you're done.
jim Sure.
karen Good luck, Halpert.
jim Thank you.
receptionist Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure.
jan Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just so rude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy!
michael I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible.
jan Oh, just. No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so.
michael Well, it's. No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
jan Oh, I know, I know. It's just. I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do?
michael I don't know. Well I guess. you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
jan Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5
 15. It could work. This could work, really!
michael I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack!
pam How'd it go?
michael No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! kevin Nealon.
michael Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in. " Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?
dwight To intimidate my subordinates.
michael That's stupid.
dwight It was Andy's idea.
michael You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack. Ryan, coffee.
ryan I don't do that stuff anymore.
michael No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.
michael So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place. is like. the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my. graveyard. for my bones.
pam Did. karen get the job?
michael Back to work. Still waitin' on that coffee.
dwight Pam, hello.
pam Dwight, hello.
