michael_scott Hup!
pam_beesly Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
michael_scott Hup!
pam_beesly We're getting pretty good at it.
jim_halpert Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
pam_beesly The timeline's messy.
jim_halpert Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
andy_bernard This is my solo.
pam_beesly I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
andy_bernard Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
jim_halpert I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
andy_bernard Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
pam_beesly I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
andy_bernard Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
phyllis_vance What's wrong with you?
dwight_schrute These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
phyllis_vance I think you look nice.
dwight_schrute Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
charles_miner Looking good.
dwight_schrute 'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! Okay.
dwight_schrute When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
michael_scott Hey.
dwight_schrute Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
michael_scott Is this good?
dwight_schrute They have some great kitchen ideas.
michael_scott Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
dwight_schrute It's small, I know.
michael_scott I really appreciate it.
dwight_schrute Thanks, Michael. Wait, what is this?
michael_scott It's for your trouble.
dwight_schrute Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.
michael_scott No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
dwight_schrute Michael, you know I can't take this.
michael_scott Yes, I do.
dwight_schrute But don't forget you owe me $10.
michael_scott That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
dwight_schrute Michael.
andy_bernard What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
jim_halpert I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
andy_bernard It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
jim_halpert Am I going down a road?
andy_bernard When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
jim_halpert It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
andy_bernard I know a few things about love. Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
jim_halpert I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
michael_scott Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
pam_beesly I'm not gonna do that.
michael_scott That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
ryan_howard I can get there.
michael_scott Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
ryan_howard Oh, awesome.
michael_scott Bring it in. Morning cheer.
here_comes_treble_singer Pam & Ryan U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!
pam_beesly I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
dwight_schrute You needed to speak to me?
charles_miner Dwight, take a seat.
dwight_schrute I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
charles_miner Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
dwight_schrute Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
charles_miner I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
dwight_schrute Your concern is noted.
charles_miner Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
dwight_schrute Like a wolf. Thank you.
charles_miner And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
dwight_schrute Really?
charles_miner Definitely.
dwight_schrute It's firm.
michael_scott I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
dwight_schrute I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
michael_scott Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
dwight_schrute No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
michael_scott I'm not following you.
dwight_schrute Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
michael_scott Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
dwight_schrute Good, do you see what I'm saying?
michael_scott Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott Can I use it?
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott Dwight, are you talking about us?
dwight_schrute It is possible that I could be talking about us.
michael_scott Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
dwight_schrute It is the situation that we are in now.
michael_scott So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
dwight_schrute I'm not a barbarian.
michael_scott Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
dwight_schrute I will.
michael_scott Dwight?
dwight_schrute Yes?
michael_scott Is the cool new guy Charles?
dwight_schrute I've said too much.
michael_scott Is it Stanley?
jim_halpert Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
andy_bernard 'Noishe.'
jim_halpert -I just don't know if I can do it.
andy_bernard That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
jim_halpert It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
andy_bernard And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. Ah, what'd you do that for?
jim_halpert You know that I was doin' this.
andy_bernard Totally.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
dwight_schrute I'm sorry, Michael
charles_miner Hi, Michael.
michael_scott Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
charles_miner No, Mich-Michael.
michael_scott Dwight, run!
charles_miner Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
michael_scott You be cool.
charles_miner Yes.
michael_scott Just-what's going on?
charles_miner We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
michael_scott Mm-do... Dwight would not-
charles_miner He did.
dwight_schrute I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
charles_miner Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
michael_scott I. Understand. Nothing.
michael_scott Wow.
pam_beesly Michael, are you alright?
michael_scott It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
pam_beesly Tell us what you're talking about.
ryan_howard Yeah.
michael_scott It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
pam_beesly We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
michael_scott I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
andy_bernard Hey, Jim.
jim_halpert I just totally blew a sales call.
andy_bernard Bro, I do that all the time.
jim_halpert Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
andy_bernard Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
jim_halpert Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
andy_bernard Well, so what? Your body's a ten.
jim_halpert Forget it.
andy_bernard Jim.
jim_halpert I said forget it.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute.
michael_scott Hello, traitor.
dwight_schrute I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
michael_scott I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
pam_beesly Michael!
michael_scott I'm just getting hardcore with him.
ryan_howard Finally.
michael_scott Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. Bill Cosby.
dwight_schrute Mr. Schofield, please?
receptionist He's in a meeting.
dwight_schrute Dammit!
michael_scott Is Mr. Schofield there?
Automated#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode22 phone voice If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first.
stanley_hudson So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
dwight_schrute I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
phyllis_vance You sound worried.
dwight_schrute And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations!
michael_scott Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
ryan_howard Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
pam_beesly I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
michael_scott Wow. High score?
dwight_schrute And no, I cannot lower my current prices. Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
dwight_schrute Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
michael_scott Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
dwight_schrute I would like to arrange a truce.
michael_scott So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
dwight_schrute Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
michael_scott No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
dwight_schrute Michael.
michael_scott Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
dwight_schrute In which direction?
michael_scott Toward the sun.
dwight_schrute At what time?
michael_scott Noon.
dwight_schrute That-
michael_scott You have two seconds.
dwight_schrute Michael. Sorry.
michael_scott Dwight.
dwight_schrute Michael.
michael_scott I hope you're not recording this conversation. Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
dwight_schrute You were making me do things that were not all right.
michael_scott So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
dwight_schrute And not come through for you?
michael_scott If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
dwight_schrute I want a truce.
michael_scott I do too.
dwight_schrute Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
michael_scott Cooper's.
dwight_schrute I had fish yesterday.
michael_scott Damn it.
michael_scott Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
dwight_schrute Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
michael_scott Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
dwight_schrute I hit a bear.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
michael_scott Yeah, sure.
dwight_schrute Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?
michael_scott Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
pam_beesly Sounds neat.
ryan_howard We can spend a couple days there.
pam_beesly Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute Did you enjoy your lunch?
michael_scott Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
dwight_schrute No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
michael_scott No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. You?
dwight_schrute Me.
michael_scott What about our truce?
dwight_schrute I broke it.
michael_scott On purpose?
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott Why?
dwight_schrute You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
michael_scott Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
dwight_schrute And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
michael_scott Oh. b*st*rd!
dwight_schrute Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
dwight_schrute Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend." "Tall" and "beets."
dwight_schrute And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here.
michael_scott Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
dwight_schrute Sure. That'd be fine.
michael_scott If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
dwight_schrute This is war and that is what happens.
michael_scott Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
dwight_schrute Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
michael_scott Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
dwight_schrute Michael! Michael!
michael_scott You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
receptionist Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
dwight_schrute Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
michael_scott Walking in the door...
creed_bratton Schofield Michael, good to see you.
michael_scott Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door.
michael_scott Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
creed_bratton Schofield Really?
michael_scott Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
dwight_schrute Are you saying you invented paper?
andy_bernard Okay, okay.
jim_halpert Oh, God.
andy_bernard Okay, Tuna.
kelly_kapoor Hey, guys.
jim_halpert Hey.
andy_bernard Hello.
andy_bernard Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
kevin_malone I guess I could be nicer.
phyllis_vance Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
andy_bernard Oh, really?
phyllis_vance Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert Okay.
andy_bernard Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
jim_halpert Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
andy_bernard Uh, that's not what was-
jim_halpert And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
andy_bernard Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
michael_scott What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
dwight_schrute It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!
receptionist Uh, hello, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Spin move.
receptionist Oh-
dwight_schrute Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
creed_bratton Schofield Dwight, I'm in a meeting.
michael_scott That's very rude.
dwight_schrute I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
creed_bratton Schofield Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
dwight_schrute La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
michael_scott I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
dwight_schrute Come on.
michael_scott Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
dwight_schrute What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
creed_bratton Schofield Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
michael_scott That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
creed_bratton Schofield Uh, ok, sure.
michael_scott Good, good, good. I will see you.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
creed_bratton Schofield Excuse me?
michael_scott I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?" Most colors mean "Don't say it."
dwight_schrute How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
michael_scott I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
