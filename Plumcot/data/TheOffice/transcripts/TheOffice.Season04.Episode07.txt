toby_flenderson I really didn't think I was going to have a good time, but I did. Totally did.
meredith_palmer I love camping. Anything can happen.
toby_flenderson Oh, it wasn't camping, it was more of a wilderness retreat.
michael_scott Morning.
toby_flenderson Michael.
pam_beesly Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a "get to know you" weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.
pam_beesly Did you sleep in cabins?
toby_flenderson Under the stars. It was really beautiful, you should come.
phyllis_vance Bob and I took rock climbing lessons once.
phyllis_vance Michael wasn't invited on Ryan's camping trip. Toby went, but Michael didn't go. He wasn't invited.
pam_beesly Who went?
toby_flenderson Me, Dan from Buffalo, Mark Chisholm, Jeff from Albany and Ryan, obviously. Made so many s'mores, that I finally had to say, "No more s'mores, no more s'mores."
toby_flenderson Ryan invited me to go on his wilderness adventure retreat. It was this amazing, beautiful experience
michael_scott Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
toby_flenderson Michael wasn't invited.
michael_scott Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? Not real.
jim_halpert Got it.
michael_scott So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
jim_halpert Absolutely, yes.
jim_halpert When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.
michael_scott Really?
jim_halpert Yeah?
michael_scott Oh, you wanna go today?
jim_halpert And I am always busy.
jim_halpert Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.
michael_scott How often can you actually donate blood?
jim_halpert Is there a limit?
michael_scott Your body only has a certain amount.
jim_halpert Well, is that it? Or?
michael_scott Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
jim_halpert How so?
michael_scott A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores?
jim_halpert What's that?
michael_scott Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
jim_halpert Right.
michael_scott In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
jim_halpert Not gonna change.
michael_scott I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
jim_halpert I thought we had that looked at.
michael_scott I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
michael_scott When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called "Survivorman." And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.
michael_scott OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
dwight_schrute I'm on it.
michael_scott OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. Hey, what...
dwight_schrute Let's see if any of these will work.
michael_scott Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.
dwight_schrute I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." Well I say, "It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."
michael_scott Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.
pam_beesly Do you want me to ask where you're going?
michael_scott No.
pam_beesly Great.
michael_scott Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
pam_beesly Oh.
michael_scott Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
jim_halpert Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?
michael_scott Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
jim_halpert OK, great.
michael_scott This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
jim_halpert Yup.
michael_scott When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
jim_halpert That'd be great.
dwight_schrute Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way no, I do not.
michael_scott This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
dwight_schrute No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
michael_scott Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
dwight_schrute I would make sure that you were dead.
michael_scott Well...
dwight_schrute First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
michael_scott You...
dwight_schrute And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
michael_scott You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. OK.
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
michael_scott I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- Ow! What are you doing?
dwight_schrute It would be better if you were unconscious.
michael_scott No! Gosh! Dwight. Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
dwight_schrute Do you want to do this right or not?
michael_scott Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
angela_martin Jim, we need to order a cake for Creed's birthday.
jim_halpert Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?
angela_martin Yes. Kelly's was last week, remember?
jim_halpert I do remember, yeah.
angela_martin It's birthday month. Creed's is today. Oscar's is week after next. Meredith's is at the end of the month. Michael usually goes with red and white streamers...
jim_halpert You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
angela_martin What?
jim_halpert There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.
michael_scott Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.
jim_halpert And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to "Happy Birthday." And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.
michael_scott Happy Birthday!
kelly_kapoor Ahhh!!
michael_scott Happy Birthday!
oscar_martinez Ahhh!
michael_scott Happy Birthday!
phyllis_vance Oh!
jim_halpert So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.
jim_halpert We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.
angela_martin I don't like it.
pam_beesly Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?
jim_halpert It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
pam_beesly Do you think it's a good idea?
jim_halpert No... I think it's a great idea.
pam_beesly Hmm.
dwight_schrute We're here.
michael_scott Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
dwight_schrute Here we go. Just the two of us
dwight_schrute Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
dwight_schrute Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
jim_halpert You know, try sending them another invoice.
oscar_martinez Ok.
jim_halpert Alright. Oh, did you see my memo by the way?
oscar_martinez "Let's be honest, as fun as birthdays are we could all use a break from the constant cake, so let's celebrate birthday month in style today." This is really cool.
jim_halpert Right? I was just thinking...
oscar_martinez No, totally, totally. This way we get it all out of the way at once and it could actually be fun.
jim_halpert Right! Exactly. Knew I could count on you.
dwight_schrute Good a spot as any.
michael_scott What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
dwight_schrute I'm just --
michael_scott Stop.
dwight_schrute Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. Behold.
michael_scott Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
michael_scott Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.
dwight_schrute Good luck, Michael.
michael_scott Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.
meredith_palmer Hey, Jim, can I have my own cake?
jim_halpert What's that?
meredith_palmer I really prefer devils food cake.
jim_halpert Oh, sure.
meredith_palmer Yes!
jim_halpert OK.
pam_beesly Wow! That was easy.
jim_halpert Yeah, people like me I guess.
creed_bratton Jim.
creed_bratton I hate devils food.
jim_halpert Well I think Meredith was just --
creed_bratton Screw Meredith, I don't think it's fair to let someone else pick the cake on my birthday.
jim_halpert Everybody's birthday.
creed_bratton Today is actually my birthday and I want to pick the cake.
jim_halpert What do you want?
creed_bratton I want pie. I want peach pie.
jim_halpert You want a birthday pie?
creed_bratton I want a nice cobbler.
jim_halpert Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
creed_bratton I don't care who you talk to. Just make it happen.
jim_halpert It will be Angela.
creed_bratton You tell her it's for Creed. She'll know what that means.
michael_scott Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
dwight_schrute I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
michael_scott There we go. Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts .
michael_scott I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs.
michael_scott See, this is a beautiful piece of material This could be used for all sorts of things.
michael_scott Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.
andy_bernard Tuna.
jim_halpert Andy.
andy_bernard Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.
jim_halpert Not your birthday.
andy_bernard Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.
jim_halpert Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
andy_bernard Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.
jim_halpert Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
andy_bernard Loud and clear.
jim_halpert Alright.
andy_bernard Pizza rolls.
jim_halpert OK, I'm gonna go into this office here to do some work. So I will be in here.
andy_bernard Mushroom caps.
michael_scott I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.
dwight_schrute Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. I hope he finds it. Lunch.
michael_scott Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
dwight_schrute About two more minutes .
michael_scott I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.
meredith_palmer What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday, so what if there's a lot of them?
kevin_malone Yeah, I work hard all day. I like knowing that there's going to be a break. Most days I just sit and wait for the break.
stanley_hudson I took an extra shot of insulin in preparation for this cake today. If I don't have some cake soon, I might die.
oscar_martinez Why don't you just have an apple?
stanley_hudson Why don't you mind your business?
creed_bratton Listen, I figured this out. Jimmy had his birthday three weeks ago, so he doesn't care.
oscar_martinez Probably went to his head.
creed_bratton Yeah.
oscar_martinez Hey, Jim.
jim_halpert Hey guys, what're we talking about?
creed_bratton Nothing! Nothing going on. We're talking about nothing. C'mon gang.
michael_scott Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
dwight_schrute Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... on.
toby_flenderson Hey Jim.
jim_halpert Toby.
toby_flenderson Hey, I just got the word on the communal birthdays. Great idea.
jim_halpert Oh, thanks man.
toby_flenderson Yeah...
jim_halpert Is there anything --
toby_flenderson My birthday was two months ago.
jim_halpert Oh, OK.
toby_flenderson There was no party.
jim_halpert What?
toby_flenderson Well, it... there was. But Michael scheduled it for 4 58 on a Friday. You know, people sang in the parking lot.
jim_halpert I remember that.
toby_flenderson I don't know, I just thought you could include me.
jim_halpert Seriously?
toby_flenderson I just though you could add me. I don't see the harm in that.
jim_halpert Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.
jim_halpert OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?
angela_martin No. No way. I am not a machine, Jim. You can't just change plans willy nilly and expect these little magic party elves to do your bidding. We already have devils food, peach cobbler, Fudgie the Whale, mushroom caps.
toby_flenderson I'm allergic to mushrooms.
jim_halpert That's a bummer. OK, then we need to... Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please? 'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.
pam_beesly Conference room?
jim_halpert Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.
angela_martin What am I supposed to do with two cakes and a pie?'
kevin_malone Oh, I'll take 'em.
creed_bratton Well nobody's touching my cobbler.
phyllis_vance Hey, Michael. I mean Jim.
jim_halpert Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.
michael_scott Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.
dwight_schrute Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out.
all@ Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you.
michael_scott Yeah! Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.
michael_scott Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. I can also make it the sky.
michael_scott Hey, buddy.
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott What up?
jim_halpert Sure glad you're back.
michael_scott You are relieved.
jim_halpert You have no idea.
michael_scott So what did I miss?
jim_halpert Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
michael_scott Oh.
jim_halpert So, terrible idea.
michael_scott Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
jim_halpert You did do it?
michael_scott Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
jim_halpert Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
michael_scott That's what I said. That's what she said.
jim_halpert That's what who said?
michael_scott I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
jim_halpert That's what she said.
michael_scott Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
