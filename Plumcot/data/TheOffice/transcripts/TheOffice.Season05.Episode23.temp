michael It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The michael Scott Paper Company. Okay. Not gonna make this one.
jim LOVE the hair.
pam Morning Michael!
michael Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride!
michael I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. Welcome! To the michael Scott Paper Company!
kelly So. I thought we could take the customer on a. Then. Then we could.
jim You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
kelly And.
charles Hey Kelly?
kelly Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
charles Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly.
jim The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
charles Oh, and Kelly.
kelly Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
charles Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
erin If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
charles Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
kelly Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
kevin I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
michael We are in the heart of it. And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
pam What should we do now?
michael We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
michael I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
michael I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.
pam I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
andy What do you think?
dwight Let me check. Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
andy Thank you!
dwight Yes, I am taking andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
ryan You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
michael Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
ryan Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
charles Hey jim can I get a, um-
jim Hi!
charles Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
jim Sure!
charles Yeah.
jim Okay.
jim What the hell's a rundown?
jim When did you need that rundown by?
charles As soon as possible.
jim Okay.
charles Just get it right.
jim Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
erin Oh.
dwight You know there's a ghost in this office
erin Really?
dwight A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
erin Why was she in this building?
dwight Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
erin That's crazy.
dwight Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
erin Oh my god!
dwight It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
erin Hmm.
dwight That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.
erin Oh!
dwight Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
erin Yeah.
dwight Yeah?
erin Just got some ice.
dwight erin Erin.
andy Oh, this is awkward.
erin Oops!
andy Uh oh! Oh! Oh!
erin So I'll see you guys around!
dwight Hey buddy.
michael Hey Ryan? Could you get to that copy from before?
ryan Pam's better at that stuff
pam That is so insulting.
ryan How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
pam Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
ryan I'm not judging it, it's like . I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other.
pam Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
ryan What the hell?
michael Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
ryan Yeah I make originals too.
pam Shut up!
michael Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
pam Really!
ryan Yeah!
toby Not much? What's up with you? Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. Hey does blue go with tan?
michael Would someone just make the copy?
toby I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
michael Just make that copy okay?
pam Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
ryan That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
pam I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
ryan You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
pam Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
ryan This is from the sun.
pam Oh yeah I bet.
michael They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
pam Michael, we can hear you.
michael I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
pam Okay it's my turn.
ryan No don't take that, give that back!
pam Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
ryan I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
pam You're gonna make another "spreadsheet. "
ryan Yeah!
pam Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
ryan Go make a copy, secretary.
pam Come on! Ryan!
michael They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
dwight Hey buddy, what are you up to?
andy Um, nerthing?
dwight Listen, when I saw you talking to erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your pen1s.
andy Pffft.
dwight Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
andy The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
dwight And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
andy No, that's ridiculous.
dwight No no no.
andy Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
dwight Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, Boom.
michael Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
pam Definitely.
michael Okay. There are . 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
pam We could work from home.
ryan Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
michael Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1, 2, 3- What are we gonna do?
pam . . Corner idea?
michael No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house. "
ryan Rock the house!
pam How would we know that?
jim Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is?
oscar Use it in a sentence.
jim "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"
oscar Try another sentence.
jim "This rundown better be really good"?
oscar I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
jim charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
oscar Why don't you just ask him--
jim No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
oscar What have you been doing?
kevin Try it in another sentence. . push;
ryan Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, "Hey cop, you like donuts?" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. No, not that one.
michael That's my corner.
pam I thought that was your corner.
michael No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
pam So my corner's the one with the copier?
michael Pam, I don't make the rules.
ryan Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
charles You started on that rundown yet?
jim Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
charles Oh.
jim I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
charles Okay, great.
jim Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
charles Just keep it simple.
jim Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
charles You're working hard? On this?
jim No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
charles Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
jim No, I. .
