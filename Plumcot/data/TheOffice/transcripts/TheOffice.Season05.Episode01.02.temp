michael All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up.
dwight From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
michael This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
meredith What should we do with all these leftovers?
stanley I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
dwight No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
creed I can bring these to my shelter.
stanley I'm taking my dumplings.
dwight There. Take those home to your wife.
michael Dwight, Dwight!
dwight Michael, it's time.
dwight Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
darryl Don't go breaking my scale.
andy I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time angela sees me naked.
holly Ex-squeeze me.
michael No, I will ex-squeeze you.
michael OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
dwight Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
jim Really, nothing?
darryl 2, 336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
dwight Wait a minute. pam is on the scale.
michael Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
dwight Family only.
darryl All right, got it. 2, 210 pounds.
kevin Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?
holly Almost, Kevin.
pam Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200.
holly Math is hard.
kevin Yeah.
pam Just, we'll just keep going.
andy I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
oscar All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
andy Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
oscar OK. Stanley, come on.
stanley Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there.
stanley I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
holly And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head.
michael Jimbo.
jim Ah, they moved the shower.
michael Did you see Holly's butt?
jim No, I didn't. You know why?
michael Why?
jim Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
michael I know.
jim But what have you learned about her?
michael I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times.
jim Nice.
michael And that her butt refuses to quit!
jim Well, I tried.
michael You have to agree with me. That's insane.
jim I'll just go later.
michael I thought you had to pee.
dwight 
oscar Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
holly Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
oscar Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
holly Actually, I'm a lesbian.
oscar I'm gay!
holly I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that. It's a joke.
oscar What's the joke?
holly There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
oscar Oh, you think it's a choice?
holly Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
oscar I'm messing with you, Holly.
holly I knew that. OK, bye.
oscar OK.
jim So you have the directions.
pam Yes.
jim You have a toothbrush.
pam Yes.
jim You have a cell phone charger.
pam I have everything.
pam Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. What up, 212?
dwight Fax this for me.
jim Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
dwight It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
andy Ang. Ela. Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
angela What?
andy Hey, check it out. This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
andy Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
angela No. No.
andy This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
angela I don't care.
andy OK. How do you feel about Maine? I'm on it. I'll see you later, love.
dwight Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
angela Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
dwight Monkey.
angela No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
michael Hey, hey! Pam, Pam! Hey!
jim What happened?
michael I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
pam I should really get going.
michael No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls. "
pam I'm sure it was really lovely.
michael I took a lot from other poems.
jim Call me when you get in.
pam OK, bye.
jim Bye.
michael All right, call--
pam No, Michael.
jim Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here.
michael OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
angela It doesn't matter, Michael.
michael Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
holly Oh, fancy meeting you here.
michael All right.
darryl OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
michael All right!
jim I can't believe I'm saying this, but michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because holly is kind of a major dork.
michael I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
holly Wikka wikka wikka what?
ronnie Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie.
jim I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
professor Sorry I'm late. I accidentally switched my alarm clock setting to Zapf Chancery. Which is my terrible segue into our course, Expressive Typography in New Media.
pam I'm in the wrong class.
professor Some of you may remember from last semester I am professor Monaghan. And looks like I'm boring someone already.
pam Oh, no. I just--
professor Please sit down.
holly You're shaking. Are you all right?
kelly Just leave me alone!
kelly I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So . gonna look amazing.
ronnie Hi, can I help you?
jan I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
kevin Hi Jan.
jan Hi.
kevin How's the candle game?
jan Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing? Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
kevin Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
jan Oh, they found her?
michael Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. Come on. Let's go in.
jim When michael told us that jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
holly Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
jan That's his ex.
holly Oh, she's very beautiful.
oscar Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
holly So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
oscar OK.
angela Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G. D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
holly No! You do not talk to him like that!
angela But he's an idiot!
kevin Hey!
holly He is not an idiot!
kevin Thank you, Holly.
holly He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
kevin Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
holly Well, no. Dwight.
angela Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
holly I'm sorry.
andy Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding
locales Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
angela Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
angela Hurry, we have to make this fast.
dwight Let's do this thing.
angela Hey!
angela I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8
 30. That's how I sleep at night!
jim All right, I am connecting and . you are not there. Did you install it right? How about
this Go to applications--
pam I can see you!
jim All right!
pam This is so cool.
jim So what is going on, girl in the computer?
pam Lunch with a girl from my hall.
jim Uh-huh.
pam Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
dwight OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
michael No way. No way. pam Beesley. Hello. Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
pam Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
michael Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
pam The nerve.
michael Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
pam They're on the supply shelf.
michael Let's go. We are following pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
pam New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to jim now, please?
michael OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.
darryl 2, 184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
michael Damn it. Come on.
oscar Oh!
kevin Oh, my God!
dwight Come on, Bernard.
michael Here we go. Everybody on.
dwight All right, we're set.
darryl Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
kelly I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
stanley I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
phyllis Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
phyllis Yes, I've replaced angela as head of the party planning committee. I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
michael How's it going?
phyllis It's going well.
michael Good.
holly I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
michael Cake? Who suggested cake?
phyllis We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
michael Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
michael What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having s*x. And then again for seven years.
michael Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
dwight Shotgun weddings.
jim That's not what that is.
creed Fright. Being scared to death.
michael No.
holly Obesity-caused illnesses.
dwight Obesity-caused illnesses.
michael Thank you. holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
jim I would like to lose 65 pounds.
michael Yes, all right. Who else? Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
angela No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
michael If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
jim Cryogenics. Beer me five.
michael This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
jim All right, I'm taking off.
michael Booty call.
jim Nope, just going to see Pam.
michael Here.
jim Maybe put up some shelves.
michael Wait a second. I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
jim OK, thank you for . this.
michael You want more?
jim No.
andy I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
angela It's not my problem.
andy Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
angela That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it.
andy Sweetheart. Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
andy Hey-oh!
angela I know I haven't made this easy on you.
jim Hi.
pam Hi. Mmm. 'Cause--
jim Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out.
michael It's a pretty lame party.
ronnie Does anyone want to dance?
jim Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
phyllis Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
stanley I don't like cake anymore
andy Why not, dawg?
stanley Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
dwight Michael, we have a situation.
dwight They should not be in that room.
holly That's so lame they didn't invite us.
michael You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
dwight Yeah!
michael Let's go mini-golfing.
holly Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
michael Uh.
holly It'll probably be a total disaster, but.
michael Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
dwight Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
michael You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
holly Really?
michael Yeah.
holly Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
michael Good luck. . push;
michael Oh, holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
dwight Party's over. You are so busted!
michael OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
phyllis You said fruit, Michael.
michael And what is that?
phyllis Cake.
michael You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
dwight Happy Birthday, Stanley!
holly It's kind of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days. So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
kevin What?
creed Oh nothing.
kelly It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
kelly I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico.
creed That wasn't a tapeworm.
ryan How's my favorite branch doing? All right .
michael ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.
ryan And you got a goatee!
michael I did!
ryan Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
michael Yes. Gooooo-tee!
kevin Firrrrre-duh guy!
ryan Hey Kevin. That's really funny.
kevin Yeah.
ryan It's great to see you Kev.
kevin You too.
ryan I'm keeping a list. of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. kevin just made the list.
ryan Jim. I wanted to apologize. for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community.
jim Well that's great. You're talking about your court ordered community service?
ryan I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
jim But he did, right?
ryan All right.
jim All right.
ryan 
darryl Well you lost zero pounds. No change. On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
michael Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
andy Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking?
holly Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
andy NO! I want names!
andy This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life.
oscar So how was your date?
holly Eight point five. I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt. But he's cute, right?
michael 
holly What's wrong?
michael Mmm--- mmm. Um.
michael Close the door. This is your fault.
jim Nope.
michael Your stupid friend zone.
jim Mmm.
michael I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!
dwight Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
jim How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
dwight I am hardly the problem, Jim.
jim No, you're definitely the problem.
dwight This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
ryan Kelly.
kelly Oh, hello Ryan. You look well.
ryan I wanted to say I'm sorry. for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11. Um, I want you to know I've changed.
kelly Cool.
ryan We should get a drink later. Catch up. Pick me up around eight?
kelly Oh that is so sweet. Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so.
ryan That--- I, um. cool. Well maybe I'll see you around.
kelly It's a small office.
ryan Yeah.
dwight Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry. about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line.
phyllis Yes you were.
dwight But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested?
phyllis Split the commission?
dwight Sixty - forty. Hm? I'll drive.
ryan 
holly Dieting's only half of it.
michael Mmm-hmm. Saunas.
holly And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
michael Gah, the dreadmill.
jim Probably the weirdest thing about pam being gone would be lunch. actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider. coworkers.
friend Oh, my God. Ok. Everybody just act normal. Don't say anything.
pam What?
friend My ex-girlfriend. She's right behind you. Just. hide me.
pam Really, where?
friend No no! Don't look!
pam Wow, was it the age difference?
friend Uh, actually, kind of. Yes. I just didn't like eating dinner that early.
pam Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!
phyllis Are you insane?!
dwight Hey, hey!
oscar Oh my God, what happened?
phyllis There was no client. dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
dwight And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!
phyllis You left me in a bad part of town!
dwight Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about? You look great. I can definitely see the difference.
phyllis phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
holly ". or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate. Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies. As was clearly stated in the official starting---"
michael Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
holly What are you doing?
jim Fair question.
michael I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful.
michael It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
michael Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society.
jim See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but. maybe there's something wrong with you.
michael If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"
kevin Because you're kind of doing michael Clump.
michael How do you know michael Clump?
oscar Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
michael How dare you! michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
oscar I think of him as more like. a monster? What about, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"
dwight No, no, no, it goes, it goes. look, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"
michael No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside. and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
dwight Vamping.
michael Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please?
dwight Eh, I've been sitting all day.
michael We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else. Hey. Hey. You shaved?
ryan I did.
michael Why?
ryan 
professor So, in the year 2000, fungus and even black mold was discovered growing in the cave. Some blame it on the new air conditioning system they installed. Some, on the high powered lights. Others feel that fungus is do to an over---
pam Nice.
professor Quiet please.
pam Sorry.
friend Sorry.
michael Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
dwight She should thank me.
michael Ok Phyllis, thank dwight first.
phyllis Why should I have to thank him?
michael You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok.
dwight I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
michael Finally. Right? Ok, phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat? Let's all clap at Phyllis. Ok! When michael Clump wants to remind you that corporate. their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly. Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go. Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful?
ryan Everything. She's perfect.
meredith I like her nails.
michael Ok, be more specific.
meredith I like her fingernails.
phyllis I like her purple dress.
michael What about her looks?
creed Hell of an ass.
kelly . what else do people like?
phyllis I wonder what people like about me? . Probably my jugs.
michael Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
kelly I hate dieting, I hate it so much. I hate this worm inside of me!
michael I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug. Mmmmmm.
jim Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer?
michael Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers.
ryan Oh.
michael Ahaha, Yep!

holly Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call. I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so.
oscar He'll call.
michael Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
darryl You guys lost four pounds.
michael Hey!
darryl I say we have a parade.
dwight We better.
michael Excellent! Good job.
jim So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so.
pam You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you.
jim I know. I suck.
dwight Yes, you do.
jim dwight says "Hi. "
dwight I do not! I do not say "Hi" Pam!
jim Now he is saying "Hi" louder.
pam I. listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
jim Umm.
pam No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.
jim Hey, can you go to IM?
pam OK.
jim OK. JIM9334

michael Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call?
holly I just got off. Kendall? I just got off.
michael No no, did, I heard you talking to oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?
holly Oh, no.
micheal Really?
holly No.
micheal Aach.
holly And you know what? I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise. Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
michael I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco.
holly Thanks. That's sweet. Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
michael Ugh.
holly Well, at least everyone lost weight. That's all that really matters.
michael Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
holly So we're only eight pounds behind Utica. Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
andy Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
andy andy Bernard does not lose contests. He wins them. or he quits them because they are unfair.
michael Hey, is that healthy food?
kelly Nope.
michael We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please?
jim Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
michael Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
jim Perfect.
dwight 
angela I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
andy Your wish is my command.
angela Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
