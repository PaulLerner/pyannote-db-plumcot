michael_scott Coat!
pam_beesly Michael just rented The Devil Wears Prada. He has his NetFlix sent here to the office, and he watches them in pieces when things are slow.
michael_scott Steak! Where's my steeaaak?
pam_beesly He's a big Meryl Streep fan, so I shouldn't be surprised that he's identified with her character.
michael_scott Get me Armani.
pam_beesly A suit?
michael_scott On the phone.
pam_beesly Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.
michael_scott Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are.
michael_scott I owe you an apology.
pam_beesly You finished the movie.
michael_scott Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
pam_beesly No. Go ahead.
michael_scott Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
pam_beesly Mo Chuisle. He's watching Million Dollar Baby... He's gonna try to kill me.
michael_scott So this one goes with my eyes and this one goes with your eyes. People have said I have very pretty eyes.
jan_levinson You do.
michael_scott I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
jan_levinson Well, they both go with the carpet I've ordered, and if you go with the brown leather on the sofas, then they go with that too.
michael_scott We already have a sofa. So why do---
jan_levinson A futon's not a sofa.
michael_scott It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
jan_levinson I know what a futon is, Michael.
michael_scott I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
jan_levinson It costs what it costs.
michael_scott No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything.
jan_levinson We have gone through this.
michael_scott Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.
michael_scott It's just that you say it's gonna cost what it costs---
pam_beesly Michael, it's Ryan for you.
jan_levinson Conniving little runt. Put him through.
michael_scott Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
ryan_howard I sent you an email about the new Powerpoint.
michael_scott Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
ryan_howard I had IT install the updated Powerpoint on the computer so you can use it for the presentation. I really want people there using Powerpoint.
michael_scott Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
ryan_howard Hold on, I'll get them on the phone.
michael_scott Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
jim_halpert Sure, I can hold.
dwight_schrute Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
jim_halpert Hey Dwight.
dwight_schrute None of your business, Jim.
jim_halpert Do you run the bed and breakfest?
dwight_schrute It is not a B and B.
dwight_schrute Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
jim_halpert Does the Department of Health know about this?
dwight_schrute I'm not telling you anything. Permits are pending. Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
pam_beesly Hello, I'm looking for a room.
dwight_schrute Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
pam_beesly It says here you cater to the eldery.
dwight_schrute Where did you read that?
pam_beesly Trip Advsior.
dwight_schrute Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
dwight_schrute How many in your party?
pam_beesly Two?
dwight_schrute We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
jan_levinson So, um, I forgot to tell you that I need the car tonight.
michael_scott Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
jan_levinson Why? Improv? Why don't you just pretend you have a car? Good practice, incase you ever do a scene where you need to pretend you have a car?
michael_scott Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.
dwight_schrute One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
angela_martin What about my cherub figurine?
dwight_schrute You took that with you.
angela_martin No I left it on my night table--- your night table, by the lamp.
dwight_schrute You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
angela_martin Fine.
dwight_schrute My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has s*x with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
kevin_malone The bar uses an applause meter. That is why it's so important that you all come and applaud only for my band. Scrantonicity 2. NOT Scrantonicity, which I am no longer a part of. Michael, can I count on you?
michael_scott You can not, I have a thing tonight.
kevin_malone Dammit.
jim_halpert Uh, Michael.
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
michael_scott Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
jim_halpert Darn it!
pam_beesly Shoot!
michael_scott How about this weekend?
jim_halpert No, can't.
pam_beesly We only had tonight free, and we really wanted to spend it with you.
michael_scott Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
jim_halpert Where are you going out tonight?
michael_scott You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
jim_halpert I wouldn't understand or a secret?
pam_beesly You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.
michael_scott I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will---- it will be that easy.
jim_halpert I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.
pam_beesly The Beets Motel.
jim_halpert The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
pam_beesly Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!
jim_halpert How are you doing this?
pam_beesly I don't know!
pam_beesly Oh my gosh.
michael_scott I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.
nick_figaro What's going on here?
michael_scott Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
nick_figaro We're a legit operation with a license from the city I can show you. We pay minimum wage against commision---
michael_scott No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
dwight_schrute We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
pam_beesly What are the themes?
dwight_schrute American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
pam_beesly Irrigation.
jim_halpert Nice.
dwight_schrute I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
jim_halpert Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert Not even Harry Potter?
dwight_schrute No. Jim, come on.
mose But you promised.
dwight_schrute Mose, bags! Now!
dwight_schrute Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
nick_figaro Everybody in the conference room. In 5 minutes.
michael_scott These meetings are useless.
nick_figaro I just want to remind you to stick to the script. Improving the work. So, make the call, say the lines, make the sale. Got it?
michael_scott Very inspirational.
nick_figaro We're offering a $50 bonus tonight to the guy with the most sales. Ok.
Co-Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode04 1 Or a woman.
michael_scott Or a trained seal.
nick_figaro You could make jokes when you've made a sale there rookie, ok?
jim_halpert Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
jim_halpert You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.
dwight_schrute Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
michael_scott Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?
stanley_hudson Yes, who is this?
michael_scott I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
stanley_hudson Michael?
michael_scott ...Stanley?
stanley_hudson Why are you calling me here at home?
michael_scott Senor, are you happy with your---
stanley_hudson Michael, I know that's you. Why are you calling me here at home?
michael_scott Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
stanley_hudson Michael, I know that's you. I know your voice. Why are you calling me here at home?
stanley_hudson When I'm at home at night in my own house in my sweats drinking some red wine watching my mystery stories, the last thing in the whole God forsaken world I want to hear is the voice of Michael Scott.
michael_scott Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.
nick_figaro My office.
michael_scott You bet.
nick_figaro Just dial the number on the sheet and stick to the script. Say those words exactly, got it? I don't know why we have to keep on having this conversation.
michael_scott Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
nick_figaro A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
michael_scott It is not a waste of our time.
nick_figaro This is a trading game.
michael_scott No.
nick_figaro You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.
michael_scott Vikram doesn't have my people skills.
nick_figaro Good for Vikram, because he out-sells you every night.
michael_scott Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
dwight_schrute And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
michael_scott What did you get tonight?
vikram Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.
michael_scott Oh, that looks good.
vikram Oh, and what about you? Peanut butter flavor again?
michael_scott I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
vikram Enjoy.
michael_scott Thank you.
vikram I was a surgeon back home.
michael_scott Really?
vikram Oh yeah.
michael_scott Wonder what I would've been back home?
vikram Well this is your home.
michael_scott I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
vikram Uhh, no.
michael_scott I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
jim_halpert Wait, you're going up there?
pam_beesly Yeah. Coward.
pam_beesly Oh my God. What century is this?
michael_scott You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.
Co-Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode04 2 Dude, you should review movies.
michael_scott I actually wrote a movie.
Co-Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode04 3 Really?
michael_scott I'm writing one, yeah.
Co-Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode04 3 What's it about?
michael_scott Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
nick_figaro What's so captivating? I like captivating things. And this must be really captivating because it's keeping you off the phones. I mean time is your money, that's how I know how captivating it is. Because how much time you spend talking.
pam_beesly Ugh, your turn.
dwight_schrute Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
jim_halpert Hey Dwight.
dwight_schrute Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
jim_halpert Does Mose have nightmares?
jim_halpert Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
dwight_schrute Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
jim_halpert Yeah, yeah.
dwight_schrute Great.
jim_halpert Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.
dwight_schrute Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
jim_halpert Good night, Dwight.
Co-Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode04 2 Yeah, so we're all gonna go out for a beer. Do you wanna come?
Co-Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode04 3 We'd love for you to come, Michael.
michael_scott Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
Co-Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode04 2 All right, next time dude.
michael_scott Okay, see you guys. Hey, how you doin'?
jan_levinson You drive, I had too much wine.
michael_scott Okay. How's yoga?
jan_levinson I didn't go.
michael_scott Wh-Why not?
jan_levinson I just didn't!
michael_scott Okay.
jan_levinson How was improv?
michael_scott Good night Vikram.
vikram Good night.
michael_scott Hey, congrats on the bonus.
vikram Thank you Michael.
michael_scott I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
vikram Well if you concentrate and make your calls faster, yeah.
michael_scott Good night.
vikram Good night.
pam_beesly Michael. Morning. Hey Dwight, how are you?
dwight_schrute Pam.
jim_halpert You okay?
dwight_schrute I am better than you have ever been or ever will be.
ryan_howard Hey guys! What's happening? How's my favorite branch doin'?
ryan_howard Okay, Michael, why dont you start us off?
michael_scott Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
ryan_howard Ladies and gentlemen, your boss, Michael Scott.
michael_scott Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
michael_scott Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.
michael_scott And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.
ryan_howard Is this the first time you ever opened PowerPoint?
michael_scott Why?
ryan_howard You didn't prepare a presentation at all, did you?
michael_scott No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
ryan_howard I'm your boss.
michael_scott My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
ryan_howard You have another job?
michael_scott What I do between 5 30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
jim_halpert Are you a cocktail waitress?
ryan_howard You can not have another job if it affects your work here.
michael_scott It won't.
ryan_howard It did, all ready.
michael_scott Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.
kelly_kapoor You're so funny.
ryan_howard Why is Darryl here? He works in the warehouse.
kelly_kapoor I invited him.
ryan_howard It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs, this isn't information you need.
darryl_philbin There's information here? Yeah, you're right, I don't need this.
kelly_kapoor Okay.
darryl_philbin Hey, get off.
kelly_kapoor Umm, see you later tonight.
darryl_philbin I have plans later.
kelly_kapoor Okay, bye honey.
ryan_howard How long until you actually get this presentation ready?
michael_scott Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
ryan_howard You know what I really want? Honestly Michael, is for you to know it, so you can communicate to the people here, to your clients, to whomever.
michael_scott Huh, okay.
ryan_howard What?
michael_scott It's whoever, not whomever.
ryan_howard No, it's whomever.
michael_scott No, whomever is never actually right.
jim_halpert No, sometimes its right.
creed_bratton Michael is right. It's a made-up word used to trick students.
andy_bernard No. Actually, whomever is the formal version of the word.
oscar_martinez Obviously it's a real word, but I don't know when to use it correctly.
michael_scott Not a native speaker.
kevin_malone I know what's right, but I'm not gonna say, because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night.
ryan_howard Do you really know which one is correct?
kevin_malone I don't know.
pam_beesly It's 'whom' when it's the object of a sentence, and 'who' when it's the subject.
phyllis_vance Yeah, that sounds right.
michael_scott Well it sounds right, but is it?
stanley_hudson How did Ryan use it? As an object?
ryan_howard As an object.
kelly_kapoor Ryan used me an object.
stanley_hudson Is he right about that?
pam_beesly How did he use it again?
toby_flenderson It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to explain the computer system, the object.
michael_scott Thank you.
toby_flenderson To whomever, meaning us, the indirect object. Which is the correct usage of the word.
michael_scott No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
ryan_howard Wait! This doesn't matter. And I don't even care. Michael, you quit the other job, or you're fired here.
michael_scott I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life. So, you are filming history.
michael_scott Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs. One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---
telemarketer Figaro Lipophedrine
michael_scott And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
telemarketer Figaro Never heard of it.
michael_scott In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this.
telemarketer Figaro Are you quitting?
michael_scott I am.
telemarketer Figaro Come back anytime, don't forget to disinfect your headset.
michael_scott I was never in this for the money. But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me. I tried to live the dream. I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed. But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.
andy_bernard So.
pam_beesly What's up?
andy_bernard Me. All night. Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.
pam_beesly You're being gross.
andy_bernard Not from a male perspective. You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.
pam_beesly What moves?
andy_bernard I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.
pam_beesly I can't believe that's not working.
andy_bernard Yeah.
pam_beesly Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.
andy_bernard Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
pam_beesly She's very religious.
andy_bernard Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
pam_beesly Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.
andy_bernard Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
pam_beesly That's right, you did.
andy_bernard Yeah.
pam_beesly Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
michael_scott Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right? A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.
kevin_malone I do gamble Michael.
michael_scott Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?
kevin_malone The mob.
michael_scott Do you know anybody in the mob?
kevin_malone
michael_scott Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
kelly_kapoor What do you mean you have plans tonight?
darryl_philbin I have my daughter tonight; we're renting Charlotte's Web.
kelly_kapoor Well, you have to make a choice, it's either your daughter, or me.
darryl_philbin My daughter.
kelly_kapoor Okay, I see how it is. Oops.
darryl_philbin That was cold.
kelly_kapoor
phyllis_vance He's always been terrible with money.
stanley_hudson I bet it's Jan spending him straight to the poor house.
kevin_malone Yeah, women be shoppin'.
meredith_palmer I can't believe he has a second job.
oscar_martinez He's not even good at his first one.
michael_scott Hey guys.
kevin_malone Shh.
michael_scott What'cha talking about? Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having s*x, what it looks like, I know, I think---
pam_beesly Michael.
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey.
oscar_martinez Michael, are you having money problems?
michael_scott Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?
oscar_martinez You heard me correctly.
michael_scott Oh, I hate monkeys.
pam_beesly What's going on, why do you have a second job?
michael_scott I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
pam_beesly Doesn't Jan have money?
michael_scott I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.
kevin_malone True, it's best to hide our money problems from women.
michael_scott I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?
oscar_martinez and Stanley You just put it back in your pocket.
michael_scott Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
darryl_philbin Hey, let's call this what it is.
darryl_philbin It's like she only wants to hook up when Ryan comes around. It's gotten to the point where I get excited every time I see that little dude walk through the door.
kelly_kapoor Well, I just need to know where this is going.
darryl_philbin Hey, I like you. Oh yeah, what's not to like? But you need to access your uncrazy side, otherwise maybe this thing's run its course.
kelly_kapoor Don't you dare walk away from me Darryl Philben, you are the most selfish person I've ever met in my entire---
darryl_philbin Slow down, think it over.
kelly_kapoor Darryl Philben is the most complicated man that I've ever met. I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?
creed_bratton Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
michael_scott No you didn't.
creed_bratton Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
creed_bratton Creed Bratton has never declared bankruptcy. When Creed Bratton gets in trouble, he transfers his debt to William Charles Schneider.
michael_scott How would that help Creed? In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.
creed_bratton You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands.
michael_scott That is a good point.
creed_bratton Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
michael_scott Like the witness protection program.
creed_bratton Exactly.
oscar_martinez Not at all.
michael_scott I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.
michael_scott I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
oscar_martinez Hey, I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.
michael_scott I didn't say it, I declared it.
oscar_martinez Still, that's not anything.
oscar_martinez This is a lot of credit card debt.
michael_scott Yeah, tell me about it.
oscar_martinez Mmm.
michael_scott You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
oscar_martinez Okay, a hundred and twenty-five dollars, Amazon.
michael_scott Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
oscar_martinez Twelve hundred dollars. What's a Core Blaster Extreme?
michael_scott That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.
andy_bernard I left a little present for Angela. I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together. I got game.
oscar_martinez Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
michael_scott Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
oscar_martinez The red bar is what you spend on non-essentials, like magazines, entertainment, things like that.
michael_scott Right.
oscar_martinez This scary black bar is what you spend on things that no one ever, ever needs, like multiple magic sets, professional bass fishing equipment.
michael_scott How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?
pam_beesly Man, Angela really had a hold on him. Angela.
oscar_martinez Michael, I'm going to set you and Jan up with a debt consolidator, you meet with this guy.
michael_scott No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
oscar_martinez She has to know.
michael_scott We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
oscar_martinez Michael, this is a presentation tool.
michael_scott You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
oscar_martinez I'm done!
michael_scott No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
oscar_martinez Jan is smart.
michael_scott She poses.
jim_halpert Dwight, how's the hotel business?
dwight_schrute Stupid.
jim_halpert Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert Maybe you should.
dwight_schrute Maybe you should. Whatever.
pam_beesly We wrote a good review. Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.
jim_halpert The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
pam_beesly Table making never seemed so possible.
jim_halpert You will never want to leave your room.
pam_beesly The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.
dwight_schrute I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
pam_beesly We really did. It was fun.
oscar_martinez So due to Michael's clever financial maneuvering, he finds himself tremendously in debt.
jan_levinson You're broke?
michael_scott Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
jan_levinson Michael, how did this happen? Where did all your money go? I don't, I don't get this. I really don't. I don't know how you could be so irresponsible. I mean, this is, it is astounding to me, really. I don't know what more to say.
oscar_martinez Jan.
jan_levinson Yeah, what?
oscar_martinez Michael left.
jan_levinson Okay, where did he go?
oscar_martinez I don't know.
jan_levinson Well, is he coming right back?
oscar_martinez I don't think so.
jan_levinson I'll be right there.
michael_scott What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.
angela_martin You may ask me out to dinner. Nothing fancy or foreign, no bars, no patios, no vegetables, and no seafood.
pam_beesly Dwight.
dwight_schrute Uhh-mmm
jim_halpert Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
dwight_schrute No you didn't.
jim_halpert Yeah, I didn't think I had. Well, it was all about Pam.
dwight_schrute Mmm-uh-mm
jim_halpert Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it. I mean, I lost it Dwight. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything. Even weird stuff, like food had no taste. So my solution was to move away. It was awful. It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
dwight_schrute
pam_beesly Hey, I was thinking about dinner---
jim_halpert Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Yeah?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
jim_halpert Yep, I'm very passionate about Italian food. In fact, um, I'm in love with Italian food.
oscar_martinez Jan, he went running that way.
jan_levinson Alright.
michael_scott Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Hey Jan.
jan_levinson What's going on?
michael_scott Not much, what's up with you?
jan_levinson Well, why are you sitting on a train? Where are you going?
michael_scott I'm out of answers Jan.
jan_levinson What does that mean?
michael_scott I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.
jan_levinson Michael, come on. Running away from your problems won't solve anything. You know that.
michael_scott I don't know that.
jan_levinson Your creditors can follow you anywhere with ease. Your debt follows you around the world, electronically.
michael_scott I'll stay off the grid.
jan_levinson Uh, Michael, come on, come on, you can deal with this. It's not that bad.
michael_scott Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.
jan_levinson Well, when my life fell apart and they, and they screwed me in New York, and I felt like my whole world was collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone. I mean, my whole family still won't even talk to me, on the advice of counsel, and my friends were just waiting for this to happen.
michael_scott That's really nice of you to say.
jan_levinson Michael, no, what I want to say is you were there for me. By my side. Without even a thought. That's just who you are. I mean, no matter how badly I treat you, or what I'm going through, you just, you are there for me. And that is a guy worth staying beside. So, where's this train taking us?
michael_scott I think the engineer left.
dwight_schrute Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
michael_scott Don't sell your implants please.
jan_levinson I'm keeping them. I know you like them. They're kind of uncomfortable though.
michael_scott That's nice though.
jan_levinson It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
michael_scott It looks cute though.
