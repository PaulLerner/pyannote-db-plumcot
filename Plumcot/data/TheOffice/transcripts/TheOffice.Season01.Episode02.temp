michael Hey, uh, can I help you out in here? Mr.
brown Oh, I'm all set, thanks.
michael Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
michael Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.
jim That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, "100% post-consumer content. " What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.
jim Do you really have to do that right now?
dwight Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
jim Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you. Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying. Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
dwight Retaliation. Tit for tit.
jim That is not the expression.
dwight Well, it should be.
jim This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?
jim Solitaire?
pam Yeah, Freecell.
jim Six on seven.
pam I know. I saw that.
jim So then, why didn't you do it?
pam I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.
jim Who doesn't love that?
michael Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
oscar All right.
michael Did you have a good weekend going there?
oscar It was fine.
michael Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
oscar Martinez.
michael Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis! Mr.
brown Great. We're all set.
michael Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. oscar works in. here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
jim Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
michael It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
jim You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that. Mr.
brown Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
michael Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards! Mr.
brown Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
michael You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race. Mr.
brown Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
michael Exactly, were not. Mr.
brown That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
michael With tolerance. Mr.
brown No. With more ignorance.
michael Ignorance. Mr.
brown Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
michael Let's celebrate. Mr.
brown Right. OK.
michael Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right? Mr.
brown Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that.
michael You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody. everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
dwight I have two. White and Indian. Mr.
brown Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
michael Yes. Mr.
brown Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
michael OK. Mr.
brown Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
dwight A few of the ground rules?
michael Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
dwight OK, can we steer away from gay people? Mr.
brown Um.
dwight I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so. paradox. Mr.
brown Well, we only have an hour.
dwight I figured it would save time.
michael OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr. Mr.
brown Mr. Brown.
michael Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that. Mr.
brown Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.
michael How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black? Mr.
brown So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
michael I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off. Mr.
brown Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.
michael OK, I will play guy listening. Mr.
brown Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
kevin I remember. Mr.
brown Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
michael OK.
michael kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.
kevin Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
michael OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin. He's butchering it. Could you just let me. Every time. Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass. I take care of my kid! Mr.
brown Wait a second.
michael They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do! Mr.
brown Stop it!
michael What you want a cookie? Mr.
brown Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
dwight Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero. Mr.
brown Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
dwight A hero kills people, people that wish him harm. Mr.
brown OK.
dwight A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged. Mr.
brown Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
dwight We all have a hero in our heart. Mr.
brown Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
michael I don't think I can sign this. Mr.
brown I can't leave until you do.
michael Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so. I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so. Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this? Mr.
brown Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
michael Sure. Mr.
brown We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.
michael Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of. racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit. Mr.
brown Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.
michael OK, well I know. You told me that several times. Mr.
brown Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
michael OK. Mr.
brown Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.
michael Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't. Mr.
brown Don't worry about dating.
michael I won't. Mr.
brown OK. Thank you.
michael Yeah, yeah. . push;
michael "I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness. " Open-mindedness, is that even a word? ". into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck. " He's going to lose it when he reads that.
jim Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
michael "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart. " I do believe. in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look. the guy, "Mr. Brown, " he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
michael All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.
toby Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we?
michael Get out.
toby I'm sorry.
michael No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um. thanks for coming in. Um. Diversity. is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
michael Hi. I'm michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, "If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North. " And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
michael OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
jim
 Uh, is that it?
michael Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
kevin It was kind of hard to hear.
michael Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um.
kelly I have a customer meeting.
michael Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
oscar What part Native American?
michael Two fifteenths.
oscar Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.
michael Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
oscar OK, Michael, um. Both my parents were born in Mexico.
michael Oh, yeah.
oscar And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
michael Wow.
oscar My parents were Mexican.
michael Wow. That is. That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
oscar Thank. Yeah.
michael Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
oscar Mexican isn't offensive.
michael Well, it has certain connotations.
oscar Like what?
michael Like. I don't. I don't know.
oscar What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
michael No. Now, remember that honesty.
oscar I'm just curious.
michael . empathy, respect. Jim! Jim!
jim Hello? Hello?
michael I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore. Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and. Take a card, take a card, any card. Um. And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so. I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And. I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.
michael Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's.
michael Oh this is a good one.
pam Um, hi. How are you?
stanley Fine. How are you?
pam Great.
michael Push it.
stanley I admire your culture's success in America.
pam Thank you.
michael Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
stanley Who am I supposed to be?
michael No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
dwight Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
dwight Um. Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
pam That's nice, Dwight.
dwight OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
pam OK, I like your food.
dwight Outback steakhouse. I'm Australian, mate!
michael Pam, come on. "I like your food. " Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
pam OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.
dwight Oh, man, am I a woman?
michael You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. "Too soon for Arabs. " Maybe next year. Um. You know, the ball's in their court.
jim What are you watching?
ryan Chappelle's Show.
jim Really?
ryan I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.
jim No way. I think she likes this stuff.
ryan Great. She's cute, huh?
jim Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but.
ryan Oh, no, the girl in the. sketch.
jim Oh, yeah. She's hot.
kevin Hey.
angela Hey.
kevin You wanna go to the beach?
angela Sure.
kevin You wanna get high?
angela No.
kevin I think you do, mon.
angela Stop.
michael OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
michael Kelly, how are you?
kelly I just had the longest meeting.
michael Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my googi, googi. Try my.
michael All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
jim Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your. what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your. Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.
michael I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted. I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
kevin Maybe some spagh-etti.
michael Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
stanley It's collard greens.
michael What?
stanley It's collard greens.
michael That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm. OK, well, it's after five. So. Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
jim Um. Hey.
pam Mmmm.
jim Hey.
pam Oh.
jim We can go.
pam Sorry.
