dwight Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you!
jim Once a year dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate. because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.
dwight How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum. and you are attacked by triads. how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch
jim OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
dwight No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!
kevin No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
dwight False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!
jim OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
dwight That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.
jim So let's just say that dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
dwight Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. Block. Grasp wrist as such.
jim And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
dwight Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!
jim Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
dwight He really is, but not for long. Ow! Instep, oh, not again. You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
jim You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
dwight The important thing to remember Jim. we always have what is called the element of surprise.
michael But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.
andy I did stand up comedy once.
michael You did?
andy Yeah, I killed.
michael That sounds like it was hilarious.
andy It was hilarious.
dwight Michael?
michael Yes?
dwight What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
michael You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
dwight This one, from david Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
michael Woo hoo, shout out!
dwight Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
michael Erin, do we have the journal?
erin Your feelings journal? You told me to put it in the time capsule.
michael Did you?
pam Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.
michael Oh, the Wall.
oscar I found the article. "On a day marked by panicked corporate board meetings, one that is relatively not surprising is Dunder Mifflin's. It is rumored that they will recommend. " and the article cuts off.
michael It's $1. 99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say?
jim Are you serious?
andy I got it, I got it. Oh, Tuna beat me to it.
phyllis "It is rumored that they will recommend declaring bankruptcy. "
michael No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
stanley Oh lord, we're all gonna lose our jobs.
oscar Not necessarily, bankruptcy could mean a lot of things. Maybe they're just restructuring to get out of debt.
michael Oh, that sounds awful.
oscar Or it could mean the end of Dunder Mifflin.
michael Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory.
dwight You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize. david Wallace's
secretary I'm sorry, Michael, David's in a meeting.
michael Ah, well maybe you should spy on him. Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious! david Wallace's
secretary Um, I'll just have him call you back.
michael OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye. He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.
kevin Michael, are you OK? Did you throw up in there?
michael No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be.
kevin It smells like throw up in here.
michael Crazy world. Lotta smells.
kelly Guys, what if this is our last day at work? What if we never see each other ever again?
andy I like Erin. There, I said it. I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so. it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.
jim We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.
michael OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.
jim Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine. So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.
michael Monkey see, monkey do.
jim That's it.
michael Monkey pee all over you.
jim That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
michael We have a monthly staff meeting
jim Alright, let's conference room it up! Here's the deal guys. There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.
jim Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better. I only slack off when things are good.
jim Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
dwight He needs me. Seat saved infinity.
jim OK, great.
michael What? Oh my God! There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah.
michael Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations. Battleship got me through my parents' divorce. Operation got me through my vasectomy, i. e, my operation. I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.
meredith Belles, Bourbon and Bullets, a murder mystery dinner party game.
michael It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it.
jim Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.
michael This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.
jim I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
michael Tube City, you owe me one.
jim Co-managing is a give and take. You have to pick your battles. One of the battles that I picked was to stop michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them. He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one. Voice on CD
player August the 5th, 1955. It's a sad day down here in Savannah. Local magnate Bill Bourbon was killed last night and all y'all have congregated tonight for a meal to celebrate Bill as he passes on to his great reward. You're not just here to pay your respects, you have to figure out which of y'all is the no-count scoundrel who killed him.
stanley This is ridiculous.
michael There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
stanley What kind of food?
michael Sandwich platters.
stanley I'm in.
michael Baby carrots.
michael OK, here are your character cards. Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props. Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is. Everything else is up to your imagination. So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.
kevin Whoa, I'll try it.
michael OK, use your imaginations.
andy Who'd you get?
erin Naughty Nellie Nutmeg, a vivacious young socialite with a penchant for scandal.
andy Oooooo, saucy.
erin How about you?
andy Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.
angela Michael, I don't like this game. It's scary.
michael It's not scary.
angela I don't like my character.
pam Who are you?
angela Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch doctor of the Savannah swamps. I'm not comfortable with this.
michael Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
michael Well, well, well. What is this contraption, I do declare?
oscar It's my blackberry Michael, I am trying to get updates on the company.
michael Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
ryan You don't have to keep saying "I do declare". Any time you say something it means you are declaring.
michael That is the way Southern people talk.
jim And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
michael Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?
pam I'll go. My name is Deborah U. Tante. Deb for short.
andy That's clever, Debutante.
pam Bill Bourbon was my uncle. I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.
meredith Nice accent. You sound like Forrest Gump.
pam I do not.
andy Well, you do actually. You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.
kevin Oooo, now do the Swedish chef.
andy Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?
kevin He lives on Sesame Street, dumbass.
phyllis You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
dwight Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
michael No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.
dwight I will poison your food.
andy I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.
michael Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
michael I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.
kevin Y'all. . push;
creed Sorry I'm late, boss. What's going on?
michael Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
creed OK. Hang on just a second. Let me just settle in and I'll be right back.
michael Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
andy Hey there young lady.
erin Hello.
andy I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.
erin Sounds like a plan, Sugar.
andy Alright, a plan it is.
dwight Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
angela It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
dwight I know you did it!
dwight I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
kevin Do you want to go out on a date with me? We can make out by the horses.
erin Well, you know ol' Nellie's always up for a romp in the hay.
meredith How about a threesome?
erin Yeah, my boudoir's always open.
kevin Nice.
andy I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin. Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone. And she might be a murderer.
oscar I just got an email from corporate, specifically for Accounting to stop all payments to our vendors.
phyllis What does that mean?
oscar Well, maybe nothing but it could mean a problem with liquidity-
michael Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah.
oscar This plantation, we're running low on greenbacks. We're having problems paying the people who give us the seeds and the dirt. We can't pay. - Michael, I can't - Basically it could mean a lot of things, but it is unprecedented, so it's cause for concern.
jim OK, I'm going back to work.
michael No no no no no no no. I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go. Voice on CD
player Well by now you've figured out that ol' Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.
phyllis Michael, I was doing so well.
michael Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is. Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju. what am I gonna do?
jim OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.
kevin That could be a good sign.
angela Hey everyone, Kevin's going to give us his take on the situation. Let's listen up.
jim Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
kevin Now, jim telling us all to work? I think that is a very good sign.
angela Don't just say things.
jim Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets. Do you want to-
michael I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case.
jim No, you're not reopening the case. The case is closed.
michael No it ain't.
dwight Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
andy Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's. It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.
erin I haven't seen it.
andy Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?
erin Of course, Nathaniel.
andy Yeah, OK.
erin Where are you taking me?
andy Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.
erin Savannah? That's a far way from Scranton.
andy Did you mean a real date?
erin No. Did you?
andy Totally. not.
erin I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
dwight You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
michael I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
dwight Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
michael This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir.
dwight Answer me.
michael You are out of order.
dwight You are out of order.
michael You are-
pam I think michael may have snapped.
jim Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
pam Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?
jim Both. They're both worse.
jim It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out. We're not going under.
pam Jim, what if we both lose our jobs? I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.
michael Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?
jim Michael, not now.
michael Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on.
pam I should just go. Where to now Caleb?
michael To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
jim Michael, can I. OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.
michael Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
meredith I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
dwight Hey shut up. You're dead.
jim Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
michael No michael here, my name is-
jim Caleb!
jim Today of all days.
michael No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright?
michael Oh, you startled me. My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest. What can I do you for?
erin Wallace is on the phone. He's returning your call.
michael Detective Wallace?
erin I don't think so. I think it's david Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.
michael Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.
oscar You're not gonna answer the phone?
michael No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.
jim I'll take it.
jim Hey David.
david Hey, sorry to be getting back to you guys so late. Things are still a bit unclear, we didn't officially decide anything yet.
jim Oh, OK.
david But if I can be candid with you here Jim, it's not good. We fully expect to be out of money by the end of the year. Insolvent. So, well. You know what? I'm sorry, I have to run. But we will talk soon, OK?
jim Sure. Oh, you know, while I have you. today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
david You know what? I can't really get my head around anything like that right now, but that's great. Keep after it, but I gotta run.
jim OK.
david Thanks Jim.
jim See ya.
pam What's the news?
jim Nothing yet.
phyllis Well, I guess that's not-
jim Well there is some bad news. There has been another murder.
michael A murder, you say? I do declare.
jim Conference room everyone.
stanley Do we have to play?
jim No.
stanley Super.
dwight Oh, this could be a juicy one.
michael Get in there!
jim I think today was a good day to have two managers. 'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing. But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy. It's because they're doing it for the kids. And I get that now.
michael There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue. My little heart can barely take it no more. Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.
andy I didn't do it!
dwight OK, everybody just calm down.
andy I am calm.
michael On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
dwight I have crossbows.
michael We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
dwight OK, I'm ready.
michael One, two, three.
jim andy revealed himself to be a double agent. At which point dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent. And then michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent. Oh, and it is 6
 00.
jim Really?
pam It wasn't me. I'm not goin' down for this!
jim Yeah, I want to go home.
pam Get the keys out of my purse, start the car.
