michael_scott Welcome children of the Scranton Industrial Park Community.
Kids#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode08 YAY!
michael_scott Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha... ... ha ha ha.
jim_halpert We are doing a haunted house this Halloween. Which is actually kinda spooky because, as legend has it, on this very site there used to be a productive paper company.
michael_scott I am going to scare these kids so bad.
darryl_philbin This is the spookiest warehouse in the world, kids. You don't believe me? Just take a look. Oh. Scary, huh? This is a surgery with an octopus and a burn victim.
angela_martin Black widow.
kelly_kapoor Lulu from The Fifth Element.
darryl_philbin Nobody told me what people were, alright? So... label yourselves or take what you get.
creed_bratton I want to sell your blood!
ryan_howard That's really not the trend in vampires right now.
darryl_philbin Here is an old man and a goth dude... and then the old crone from Drag Me to Hell.
meredith_palmer I'm a hobo.
darryl_philbin I asked for a list. ...and a clown.
dwight_schrute I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
darryl_philbin You're not as scary as Book Face, over there.
jim_halpert Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
darryl_philbin Ok, kids. You've all been so good and unbelievably patient so I think you are gonna get some candy!
Kids#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode08 Yeah!
michael_scott Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
michael_scott Why is Christmas the only holiday that can have a message?
michael_scott It is the easy way out. You are not alone.
darryl_philbin What the hell is wrong with you?
michael_scott Who wants candy?
michael_scott ...and then I think I'm going to go to the Garlic Festival.
jim_halpert Wow.
michael_scott Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
jim_halpert I bet we would.
michael_scott They have a TCBY booth.
jim_halpert Cool.
michael_scott The same stuff you get downtown.
jim_halpert Mmm-hmm.
michael_scott Do you like TCBY?
jim_halpert Who doesn't?
michael_scott I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun
erin_hannon I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're expecting the both of you in an hour.
jim_halpert Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
erin_hannon They said the both of you.
jim_halpert That is a mistake.
michael_scott You should give them a call. Check that out.
jim_halpert Alright. Let's clear this up. Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
michael_scott Jim's a good kid. He can handle a lot but sometimes you have to call in a master. I, uh... why would you date an amateur when you could date a professional?
jim_halpert Great. See ya' then.
michael_scott Wha- what?
jim_halpert They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
michael_scott Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
jim_halpert I absolutely don't understand, either.
michael_scott I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott Let me get your stroller.
jim_halpert Sure. Michael's a good teacher. A teacher is someone who stands right next to you your whole life and never lets you do anything. That's what a teacher is, right?
michael_scott What are you gonna call him?
jim_halpert Dave.
michael_scott No. What is his name?
jim_halpert Dave.
michael_scott Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
jim_halpert Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
michael_scott Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
jim_halpert Yes, it is.
michael_scott ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
jim_halpert No thanks.
michael_scott They are into style.
jim_halpert Mmm-hmm.
michael_scott They are into appearance. We are selling success.
jim_halpert ...and paper.
michael_scott That's sorta secondary.
jim_halpert Nope. No.
jim_halpert He's trying to micro-co-manage me... or co-micro... manage... me.
pam_beesly Here we are outside-
andy_bernard WB!
pam_beesly - the Wilkes-Barre Industrial Park.
andy_bernard Industrial P.! Makin' cold calls.
pam_beesly The two people with the lowest sales in the quarter have to do them.
andy_bernard Where are you? Dean Trophies. Suite 100. Sherman Blinds and Rugs. Suite 202.
pam_beesly Here it is. Suite 401.
andy_bernard Yeah. I was gonna sing that part.
pam_beesly I know. Now you don't have to.
andy_bernard Except it was going to resolve the melody, so now my head hurts. Feels like I held in a sneeze. Mmm! I hate this feeling. Suite 401.
michael_scott Alright. Hi. Any messages?
erin_hannon You're soaking wet.
michael_scott Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
phyllis_vance Wow. Sounds scary.
michael_scott It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
angela_martin Why isn't Jim wet?
jim_halpert I outran it.
meredith_palmer I don't think it rained. My hip would be throbbing.
michael_scott It rained.
dwight_schrute Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
michael_scott Nothing. Cocoa.
jim_halpert I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
michael_scott Good. Yep.
receptionist Must be nice to have company on these cold calls.
andy_bernard We're kind of a dynamic duo. Or trio.
receptionist How exciting! Do you guys know the s*x yet?
pam_beesly Oh. No, no. We're not together. No, no, no. Definitely not. Definitely not. No. We just work together.
andy_bernard Looks like somebody's got a case of the definitelies.
erin_hannon Um, Michael? The custodian from Raskin Design is on the line. He said they found your keys in the Koi pond.
michael_scott Ok. Thank you.
stanley_hudson Did you say 'Koi pond'?
michael_scott Yeah?
erin_hannon Michael, people are asking questions.
michael_scott Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
phyllis_vance Michael, did you you fall into a Koi pond?
michael_scott Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
oscar_martinez Jim, did Michael fall into a Koi pond?
jim_halpert Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
michael_scott It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
angela_martin So you fell in?
michael_scott No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
angela_martin So a child had fallen in?
michael_scott Not yet!
kevin_malone That is hilarious.
michael_scott No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.
jim_halpert Truthfully, it wasn't the way he fell in. It was... how long it took him to get out.
pam_beesly And we'd like to offer you 15% off your first purchase as our way of welcoming you to the area.
mose Well that sounds like a really nice deal.
andy_bernard Sha-bow.
mose And I must say, that since we are a family business it is nice to see that you are, too.
andy_bernard Oh, wow. You thought that- oh, my gosh. Oh. Definitely not.
mose My mistake. Sorry.
pam_beesly It's ok.
andy_bernard Nuh. Actually, it's kinda not ok. Um, I date models. Face models. My girlfriend, on a scale of one to Giselle, uh... a nine.
mose That- that's good for you.
pam_beesly Anyway, we also have a special on envelopes.
andy_bernard Pam's carrying our surrogate. Because my girlfriend needed to keep her figure for fashion week. So, we, uh, we put our baby in Pam. Doesn't matter what Pam looks like.
pam_beesly Yeah.
pam_beesly You were way meaner to me than I was to you.
andy_bernard No I wasn't. Ok. The very idea of us together made you burst out laughing like you just bit into an Adam Sandler and jelly sandwich.
pam_beesly You blew the sale, you idiot.
andy_bernard Let me tell you something. I was never gonna make that sale.
michael_scott Erin, do we have any of those clips that hold paper together?
erin_hannon Staples? Uh, David Wallace called.
michael_scott Oh. He did? What did he say?
erin_hannon He heard you made a big splash at the meeting. Oh, my God. That was so mean what I just said and I didn't mean it. It was Kevin and Meredith put me up to it.
michael_scott Ok.
kevin_malone I'm gonna kill you.
stanley_hudson Michael, don't listen to them.
michael_scott Thank you, Stanley.
stanley_hudson You just ignore their carp.
michael_scott Ok.
dwight_schrute Michael?
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
creed_bratton Hey, boss, did you find Nemo?
michael_scott I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
oscar_martinez Don't you mean 'Koi Story'?
phyllis_vance And when you fell in, did you flounder?
dwight_schrute Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
michael_scott I know what a flounder is.
michael_scott I'm not usually the butt of the joke. I'm usually the face of the joke. I wish Jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look... Damn it! He'd still look good.
michael_scott The most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret. Show of hands- who has been 'Koi-ponded'? Who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far? Phyllis?
phyllis_vance Michael, you make fun of us every day.
michael_scott Uh...
kevin_malone Yeah. Every single day.
michael_scott You never said anything.
meredith_palmer Uh, we have. Countless times.
michael_scott Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'
angela_martin That's never the case.
michael_scott We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
dwight_schrute I don't want people making fun of my nose.
michael_scott Your nose?
dwight_schrute It's too small.
michael_scott Alright.
oscar_martinez Oh my. That is small.
dwight_schrute Just, write it down, please.
oscar_martinez Can you breathe okay?
kelly_kapoor What keeps your glasses on?
dwight_schrute Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
michael_scott No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
kevin_malone I don't want people making fun of my weight.
michael_scott Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah? Meredith?
meredith_palmer I don't want to say it out loud.
michael_scott Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
meredith_palmer I really didn't want to put it on the board but I thought maybe it was gonna come out somehow so... what are you gonna do?
michael_scott Ok.
andy_bernard That is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it.
keena_gifford Gifford Well, you two are quite the salesmen and a very cute couple.
andy_bernard Well-
pam_beesly Oh- Thank you.
keena_gifford Gifford Some couples don't seem like a good match. You two do.
pam_beesly Well, you know.
andy_bernard Yeah. You know. Two peas in a pod. We complete each other. What can I say? She loves to cook-
pam_beesly He loves to eat.
andy_bernard I love to dance-
pam_beesly I love to watch him dance.
andy_bernard Right. Sometimes I'll just dance for hours in the living room-
pam_beesly And I'll just watch him.
keena_gifford Gifford And a baby on the way? You must be so excited.
pam_beesly Yes.
andy_bernard Yeah. We are thrilled.
pam_beesly Mmm-hmm.
andy_bernard In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?
pam_beesly It was, sweetie.
keena_gifford Gifford Oh. I know the best teacher. Her name is Miss Janet.
andy_bernard Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.
keena_gifford Gifford Yeah!
andy_bernard Yeah.
angela_martin This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some people say that I eat like a squirrel.
phyllis_vance So now you're comparing yourself to a cute, tiny animal?
erin_hannon Um, Michael? The custodian called again. Apparently a Koi has died.
michael_scott It's a fish.
erin_hannon They want you to pay for it.
michael_scott It could've died of natural causes. So...
erin_hannon Well, they said you stepped on it's head. He did not suffer.
oscar_martinez When is the funeral?
michael_scott Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
erin_hannon $300.
michael_scott What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
creed_bratton Oh, you're payin' way too much for your worms, man. Who's your worm guy?
jim_halpert Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
michael_scott No, no.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
michael_scott No. We are not done here. This-
andy_bernard One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!
keena_gifford Gifford That's great!
andy_bernard Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.
pam_beesly Yeah, well, that'll happen.
andy_bernard Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too.
pam_beesly Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.
andy_bernard Message received, little soy bean.
jim_halpert I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
michael_scott No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
jim_halpert No, they don't.
michael_scott Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
jim_halpert Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
michael_scott I want to make fun of you right now.
jim_halpert Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
michael_scott No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
jim_halpert See?
michael_scott Oh, my God.
michael_scott Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.
phyllis_vance Michael. You know, when you think about it, it's not all your fault. I mean, who puts a Koi pond in a lobby?
michael_scott Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
dwight_schrute Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
michael_scott It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
kevin_malone Enjoying your nut?
oscar_martinez Kevin.
angela_martin Why?
kevin_malone I'm not mocking. I was just making an observation about a nut.
angela_martin I was.
michael_scott Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
jim_halpert Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...
kevin_malone We'll stay late.
andy_bernard Well, that went pretty well.
pam_beesly Yeah, I guess.
andy_bernard We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.
pam_beesly If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.
andy_bernard You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.
pam_beesly Yeah. Way too much.
andy_bernard Yeah.
pam_beesly I mean, what the hell was that?
andy_bernard What the heck was that?
pam_beesly When you cried?
andy_bernard Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.
pam_beesly You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?
andy_bernard No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?
pam_beesly Hmm.
andy_bernard I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
pam_beesly Well, are you dating anyone?
andy_bernard What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.
pam_beesly Ah.
andy_bernard You think I can do better?
pam_beesly Ah.
andy_bernard Gotta get my goin' out on.
meredith_palmer Hey, let's watch this thing.
jim_halpert Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
oscar_martinez How can we not watch this?
jim_halpert What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
phyllis_vance We're not mocking, we're watching.
jim_halpert That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...
phyllis_vance Well, we'll deal with it as it comes.
michael_scott Is this the tape of me falling?
phyllis_vance Yes. Put the DVD in.
kevin_malone Open QuickTime.
oscar_martinez It starts on it's own. Let it -
kevin_malone No! Use QuickTime. Trust me. I've done this.
jim_halpert Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
michael_scott No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
jim_halpert What are you doing?
michael_scott It's alright. I can handle it.
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott I am a grown-up, Jim.
meredith_palmer Shh. It's on.
kevin_malone Here they come. Boom!
oscar_martinez Oh. Did - did you see that?
jim_halpert See what?
angela_martin Why'd you stop it?
jim_halpert Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
oscar_martinez Jim, you let Michael fall in.
dwight_schrute Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
jim_halpert Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
michael_scott I don't think you froze.
jim_halpert It's a killer new dance move. Do you wanna talk in your office?
angela_martin No.
jim_halpert I didn't ask you. Would you like to talk?
dwight_schrute Judas.
dwight_schrute Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
jim_halpert I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.
michael_scott Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.
meredith_palmer Hey, what's up lifeguard?
oscar_martinez Jim, I think I'm in your way.
michael_scott Oscar's a douche.
jim_halpert He's alright.
michael_scott No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok.
jim_halpert Thanks Michael.
michael_scott You're welcome. Whoa! Almost fell.
pam_beesly Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?
erin_hannon Oh, sure. Oh, wait. Hand them to me upside down so I don't accidentally read them.
pam_beesly Ok.
erin_hannon Thanks.
pam_beesly Mmm-hmm.
erin_hannon How did today go, by the way? Did you make any sales?
pam_beesly No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.
erin_hannon Yeah, he is!
pam_beesly Yeah, he is.
erin_hannon He's, like, the coolest person I've ever met.
pam_beesly That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.
erin_hannon Oh. Do you mean Marlon Wayans? 'Cause he is.
pam_beesly I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.
