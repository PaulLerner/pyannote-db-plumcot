andy_bernard Val, I need the space.
val All right guys, clear out.
andy_bernard Everybody out.
val Promise me you're going to clean up.
andy_bernard I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.
val Promise me that-
andy_bernard Obviously I'm going to clean up.
andy_bernard Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, "Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance," and then you have to be like, "Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!" And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. s*x also works.
erin_hannon Hey! Jim's back from jury duty.
andy_bernard Hey! Tuna! He's back.
jim_halpert Hey.
andy_bernard Oh, look at this. Tuna wrap.
jim_halpert Okay.
andy_bernard Hand roll.
jim_halpert Yeah.
phyllis_vance How was jury duty?
jim_halpert It was pretty uneventful, actually.
dwight_schrute Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
erin_hannon What was the case?
jim_halpert Uh, hit and run.
erin_hannon Ooh, "the case of the hit and run," that's exciting.
phyllis_vance Did you send him to the slammer?
jim_halpert Nope. Not guilty.
dwight_schrute Of course you found him not guilty. "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm."
jim_halpert We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
dwight_schrute Not coming, have plans.
jim_halpert Okay.
jim_halpert I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.
erin_hannon Ah! Angela had the baby!
kevin_malone Is it black? 'Cause that would be hilarious.
darryl_philbin Why?
kevin_malone You know.
darryl_philbin Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
kevin_malone A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
ryan_howard Eh, a little bit.
kevin_malone Oh, did I win the pool?
erin_hannon Ah, no. Right month, wrong year.
oscar_martinez Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
erin_hannon We should all go to the hospital and visit her.
phyllis_vance Oh, I'd love to but, um-
jim_halpert Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
oscar_martinez Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
kevin_malone Yeah, Oscar's the dad, I'm Oscar's dad and Angela's my mom.
gabe_lewis Everyone, our very own Angela-
oscar_martinez We all got the email, some of us are going to go visit.
gabe_lewis Oh, I am so in.
gabe_lewis I love maternity wards. It's the perfect blend of love and horror. Things can go so wrong or so right.
andy_bernard Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?
jim_halpert Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
meredith_palmer How could it be boring? You were there for five days. Titillate us.
stanley_hudson Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay until six twice to cover for you. My wife got to the TV first, had to sit through damn Rizzoli and damn Isles.
phyllis_vance Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
jim_halpert Wow, I'm really sorry.
phyllis_vance Yeah.
jim_halpert I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.
jim_halpert So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
toby_flenderson You know, when I was on j-duty, uh, Strangler case, we used to recreate the various stranglings with empanadas from- at Ernesto's.
jim_halpert Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
toby_flenderson You mean food truck. Ernesto's was a food truck.
meredith_palmer Toby, shut your hole about the empanadas. Nobody cares about the empanadas.
dwight_schrute I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
oscar_martinez Guys, I don't know how many of you have seen- Gabe? Bring it in. I don't know how many of you have seen a premature baby before. It's going to be really tiny, so please don't say anything offensive.
kevin_malone Got that, bimbo?
erin_hannon Got it, bimbo.
angela_martin Yes?
oscar_martinez Knock, knock. Oh!
kevin_malone Hi!
angela_martin Oh... I don't- I don't want any- what are you guys doing here?
oscar_martinez We wanted to say hi to the newest little Dunder Mifflinite.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Well, meet our not-so-little bundle of joy, Philip Halsted Lipton.
kevin_malone Phillip is so fat.
oscar_martinez Kevin!
kevin_malone You warned me not to say anything if it was tiny, Oscar. But you didn't prepare me for a big, giant, fat baby.
angela_martin Hey.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Yes, he's substantial.
erin_hannon He's more than substantial. He's a monster.
dwight_schrute So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. Busted, Halpert!
jim_halpert Okay, wait, wait.
dwight_schrute Yes! Andy, get out here.
jim_halpert No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
dwight_schrute I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
andy_bernard What's up, gangstas?
dwight_schrute Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
andy_bernard Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
dwight_schrute I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
andy_bernard No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
dwight_schrute I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
andy_bernard Here, right there. Down the hatch.
dwight_schrute I really don't want to take the chill pill.
andy_bernard Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.
dwight_schrute Okay, okay. But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
andy_bernard Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu.
dwight_schrute That's good enough for me.
jim_halpert ...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.
andy_bernard I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.
jim_halpert Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
andy_bernard No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?
jim_halpert No.
andy_bernard Do you know why you never heard of it?
jim_halpert No.
andy_bernard Covered it up.
jim_halpert Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
andy_bernard They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.
andy_bernard My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.
ernesto Where you want I park?
dwight_schrute Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you.
toby_flenderson Ernesto!
ernesto Hola Toby!
toby_flenderson Yeah, hey.
ernesto Como esta?
nate Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah," I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah," but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby." "I remember Toby."
dwight_schrute Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
jim_halpert Uh-
toby_flenderson It's the empanada guy.
jim_halpert The empanada guy!
dwight_schrute No, Toby! Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. Ask him if he remembers Jim.
ernesto No.
nate He says, "No."
dwight_schrute He says, "No!" Boom!
andy_bernard Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
dwight_schrute Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.
nate Ah, he doesn't want any trouble, he sees lots of people, they come from all around to eat his delicious meat pockets.
jim_halpert Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
creed_bratton Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
dwight_schrute Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
andy_bernard Why? Everybody's heard it.
dwight_schrute Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
andy_bernard Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.
phyllis_vance Why?
andy_bernard Why? Why?
jim_halpert Because my car broke down.
andy_bernard His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
dwight_schrute Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
andy_bernard Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.
phyllis_vance I'm sorry, do you have any American Mexican food?
andy_bernard We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?
jim_halpert Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
andy_bernard I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your .
jim_halpert Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
andy_bernard I don't even know what the truth is anymore.
oscar_martinez Wow, it's so... healthy.
kevin_malone I'm going to call him Little Kevin.
angela_martin No, you will not.
erin_hannon Is he really five pounds?
angela_martin Mm-hmm.
erin_hannon Because I squat with five pounds. This- yeah, this feels like more than that.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton No, no, no, he's nine pounds, seven ounces.
angela_martin Nine pounds? Really? I thought you said five. You know what? I was under so many drugs, I felt like I was at a James Taylor concert or something, oh. So, what did you bring?
oscar_martinez Oh yeah, I don't know if it's right, but-
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Well, if it's anything like that gorgeous wrapping paper, you hit it out of the park.
angela_martin Aw, preemie pajamas!
oscar_martinez Again, it may not be the right size. I can return-
angela_martin No, I think he came early just so he could wear these. Thank you.
kevin_malone I got Little Kevin Call of Duty.
oscar_martinez This baby is clearly not premature. They're lying about the date it was conceived. It's very interesting. And her husband's gay. I don't even know which thread to follow.
jim_halpert Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.
stanley_hudson What?
jim_halpert Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
dwight_schrute You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
stanley_hudson What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
jim_halpert Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
dwight_schrute Your clients. They're all mine.
darryl_philbin Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
andy_bernard Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
dwight_schrute All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself.
andy_bernard Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
dwight_schrute No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
andy_bernard I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye.
dwight_schrute That's it? This is crap!
gabe_lewis You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao.
dwight_schrute Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best stickle.
angela_martin Shh.
oscar_martinez Honestly, I can return this for a larger size.
angela_martin It's fine. Pajamas aren't supposed to be baggy, right? It's not the barrio.
oscar_martinez The only premature baby in this room is the baby this baby ate.
angela_martin Ah!
kevin_malone Little Kevin.
angela_martin Really?
oscar_martinez Angela.
angela_martin Fine, God. Philip was conceived nine months ago.
oscar_martinez I knew that, I knew it.
angela_martin The senator and I wanted to wait, but we had just seen Thor and there was way too much wine in my chicken piccata.
oscar_martinez Chicken marsala.
angela_martin Right. Um, point is, Philip was conceived out of wedlock.
oscar_martinez Mm-hmm.
angela_martin And now you all know, but you can never tell. I'm serious.
oscar_martinez Dwight. Hey.
dwight_schrute Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
oscar_martinez He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
dwight_schrute Okay.
oscar_martinez Don't you want to see the baby?
dwight_schrute Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
oscar_martinez I promised I wouldn't tell.
dwight_schrute So don't.
oscar_martinez Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
dwight_schrute What?
oscar_martinez She got pregnant before the wedding.
dwight_schrute How long before?
oscar_martinez A month. You didn't hear it from me!
dwight_schrute Yes I did.
angela_martin Dwight?
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Dwight.
dwight_schrute I want to see the baby.
erin_hannon Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
dwight_schrute Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... willingly, or as slaves.
dwight_schrute That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose s*x, that baby is mine.
angela_martin He's hungry.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Oh, that's my cue to leave.
angela_martin No, you don't have to. I'm going to wear this cover.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Still. Still.
angela_martin You won't see-
jim_halpert You want a giraffe?
jim_halpert Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.
pam_beesly Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.
jim_halpert Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
pam_beesly Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!
jim_halpert Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
pam_beesly Oh, hi Stanley.
jim_halpert Split the difference?
pam_beesly Jim.
jim_halpert Okay, let's go.
pam_beesly Hey.
erin_hannon Hi.
pam_beesly Hi everybody!
jim_halpert What?
all@ Hi.
pam_beesly How about a little visit?
jim_halpert Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
creed_bratton Hey, Angela's back with her baby.
pam_beesly Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.
andy_bernard Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.
creed_bratton Let me have a turn.
pam_beesly No, it's the pacifier's turn.
creed_bratton All right.
jim_halpert Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
pam_beesly Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.
phyllis_vance Cookies?
pam_beesly No, but that would've been a really good idea.
jim_halpert That was a great idea.
pam_beesly No, she brought you drawings.
jim_halpert Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
andy_bernard Oh!
jim_halpert Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Oh.
andy_bernard Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?
cecelia_halpert No.
pam_beesly She says "no" to everything. You know, she thinks my name is "No." Cece, do you want some broccoli?
cecelia_halpert Yes.
pam_beesly No. It's crazy.
ryan_howard Why am I shorter than the table that I'm standing next to?
andy_bernard There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.
kelly_kapoor Cece, this is your big sister Kelly. Did you color this pretty picture?
cecelia_halpert No.
kelly_kapoor So then this means nothing to you.
andy_bernard Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?
jim_halpert You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
cecelia_halpert Mama!
pam_beesly Shh.
jim_halpert I don't know what else we can do here.
cecelia_halpert Mama, mama, mama.
jim_halpert It's okay.
pam_beesly Oh, it's okay, sweetie.
jim_halpert All right, all right. Okay.
pam_beesly It's okay, honey. It's okay, it's okay.
jim_halpert All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
pam_beesly Shh.
cecelia_halpert Mama!
dwight_schrute Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
angela_martin Every baby looks just like you. Your face kind of looks like a baby.
dwight_schrute Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
angela_martin That is completely untrue.
dwight_schrute Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
dwight_schrute You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
angela_martin I did not. Uh-uh.
dwight_schrute -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
angela_martin That didn't happen.
dwight_schrute And then I inserted my penis-
angela_martin No! Stop it!
dwight_schrute Into your-
angela_martin Dwight.
dwight_schrute v*g1n* and-
angela_martin And even if it did, it's just a coincidence.
dwight_schrute Admit that there is a chance.
angela_martin I will not.
dwight_schrute Admit it. Admit it.
angela_martin I will not, it's not-
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton All done?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Mmm.
angela_martin Yes, yes. He's sleeping.
dwight_schrute Before I go, may I?
angela_martin Sure. Watch the head, watch the head.
dwight_schrute Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
nurse_ruth Who are you?
dwight_schrute I just might be his father.
nurse_ruth I don't know what that means. We're gonna circumcise him.
jim_halpert I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?
cecelia_halpert No!
jim_halpert Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
pam_beesly I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.
jim_halpert Cece!
pam_beesly Okay, we're going.
jim_halpert Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
pam_beesly Shh, shh, shh.
jim_halpert I know, I know.
pam_beesly You want to grab her?
jim_halpert I'm gonna grab her, okay.
pam_beesly Here we go, here we go.
jim_halpert Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
stanley_hudson We'll see you tomorrow.
jim_halpert No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
phyllis_vance No, just go home.
darryl_philbin It's all good, we got this.
darryl_philbin I have a kid. Last week, Jim at home? That was no vacation.
pam_beesly Jim.
phyllis_vance Just go.
andy_bernard Hey, we'll be just fine.
jim_halpert Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
andy_bernard Oh, whew!
andy_bernard Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
dwight_schrute Oh, right. The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
gabe_lewis You had something important to tell me?
dwight_schrute Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
dwight_schrute Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
