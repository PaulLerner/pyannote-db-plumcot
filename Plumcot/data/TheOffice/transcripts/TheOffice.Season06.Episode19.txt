michael_scott Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
kelly_kapoor I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
ryan_howard Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
kelly_kapoor Well why don't you invite your friends?
ryan_howard Why are you being so weird about this?
meredith_palmer Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
ryan_howard Why no kids?
kelly_kapoor Yeah, where are your kids?
meredith_palmer Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
michael_scott It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
erin_hannon Welcome back, "Dad!"
jim_halpert Oh, thank you!
phyllis_vance Hey!
stanley_hudson Hey!
andy_bernard Welcome back Tuna!
jim_halpert Hey...
dwight_schrute Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
jim_halpert What do we got here?
dwight_schrute Mega-Desk.
jim_halpert Of course.
dwight_schrute Command central.
jim_halpert Hm hm.
dwight_schrute Surveillance, gaming- and business.
jim_halpert Okay. Just gotta...
dwight_schrute Okay. Come on! Jim!
dwight_schrute Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
jo_bennett Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling!
jim_halpert Morning!
jo_bennett Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something.
jo_bennett Oh good morning sweetheart.
michael_scott Morning, honey-pile.
jo_bennett I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
michael_scott It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
jo_bennett Is that a lump of coal?
michael_scott Yes it is!
jo_bennett Have I been that naughty?
michael_scott No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
jo_bennett Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.
michael_scott Mm, that sounds great, actually.
jo_bennett Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.
michael_scott When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
andy_bernard Erin go braugh!
erin_hannon Andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt!
andy_bernard Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
andy_bernard Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to "How I Met Your Mother" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Great.
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
jim_halpert No-no-no-no-no.
dwight_schrute Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
jim_halpert Is this yours or mine?
dwight_schrute They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
jim_halpert Good Lord! I can't believe I'm missing this.
pam_beesly It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
jim_halpert Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.
dwight_schrute Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
jim_halpert It is. Big time.
dwight_schrute Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
jim_halpert Pretty amazing.
dwight_schrute What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
jim_halpert Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
dwight_schrute I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
jim_halpert Is that what happened to you?
dwight_schrute I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
jim_halpert That's a common mistake.
dwight_schrute Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
angela_martin Hey! Are you sick?
erin_hannon Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
angela_martin In your nose?
erin_hannon Yes.
erin_hannon I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
jo_bennett Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.
michael_scott That is a great idea JB.
jo_bennett Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist.
kevin_malone Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
jo_bennett You know it doesn't have to be an invention.
oscar_martinez I have a question.
michael_scott Oscar, homosexual accountant.
oscar_martinez In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
jo_bennett I am so proud of Sabre's "Print In All Colors" initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. Daryl?
michael_scott Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
jo_bennett Okay hush now.
michael_scott Okay.
darryl_philbin The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.
jo_bennett But you wouldn't need more trucks?
darryl_philbin Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
jo_bennett Oh look at you.
michael_scott Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
jo_bennett I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?
darryl_philbin Are you serious?
jo_bennett Yeah. Take Jim's old office.
gabe_lewis Um. I set my stuff up in there. So... just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
jo_bennett Yeah, I want to hear more from you.
darryl_philbin Absolutely.
jo_bennett All right.
darryl_philbin Thank you.
jo_bennett Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!
michael_scott Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
jo_bennett Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away.
michael_scott Well, I am heading down there.
jo_bennett Well, anytime now.
michael_scott How about July 4th weekend?
jo_bennett Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket?
michael_scott I did!
jo_bennett Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?
michael_scott You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
jo_bennett Enough!
michael_scott All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
michael_scott Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
darryl_philbin Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...
michael_scott Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.
jo_bennett No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
michael_scott No is not an option.
jo_bennett Yes it is.
michael_scott All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
jo_bennett How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
michael_scott I'll be over there.
jim_halpert And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
dwight_schrute Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute My headphones are broken.
jim_halpert Right.
dwight_schrute Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
jim_halpert Yeah that's great. Great.
dwight_schrute Okay? "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"
jim_halpert When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
dwight_schrute "- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-"
jim_halpert Please stop that!
dwight_schrute "-But we'll be together then-"
jim_halpert Can you grow up?
dwight_schrute "-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then."
jim_halpert Whether it's this time or next time.
andy_bernard "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon"
jim_halpert Yeah.
andy_bernard and Dwight "Little boy blue and the man in the moon."
jim_halpert No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
andy_bernard and Dwight "When you coming home Dad?
jim_halpert You know, can I call you back?
andy_bernard and Dwight "I don't know when-"
jim_halpert That would be great, thank you.
andy_bernard and Dwight "But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-"
jim_halpert No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
jim_halpert I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
erin_hannon This fax came for you.
jo_bennett Oh no no no! Are you feeling ill?
erin_hannon Uh...
jo_bennett Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week.
erin_hannon Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
jo_bennett Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?
erin_hannon Well...
andy_bernard She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
jo_bennett Yes?
andy_bernard I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you.
jo_bennett Oh! You're sick! Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home.
andy_bernard No, no, no, no, no.
jo_bennett Get everybody sick in the office.
andy_bernard I have some good ideas...
jo_bennett We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now.
andy_bernard You sure?
jo_bennett You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
michael_scott Very nice.
darryl_philbin Not bad, huh?
michael_scott A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
darryl_philbin I impressed her with my good ideas.
michael_scott Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
darryl_philbin I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
michael_scott How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
darryl_philbin Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.
michael_scott Okay. All right.
jo_bennett Hey there.
michael_scott Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
jo_bennett Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time.
michael_scott Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
jo_bennett Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work...
michael_scott Right. What?
jo_bennett Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.
michael_scott Mm. mm. Oh well.
jo_bennett Anything else I can help you with?
michael_scott No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
kevin_malone Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
michael_scott Hey Pack-man.
todd_packer Packer Hey what's up, Butt-plug?
michael_scott How you doing stud? You already there?
todd_packer Packer Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
michael_scott How's the lady situation?
todd_packer Packer Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
michael_scott Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
todd_packer Packer Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
michael_scott Yeah. Maybe next year.
todd_packer Packer Maybe next "queer." Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?
erin_hannon Oh! Andy!
andy_bernard Hi!
erin_hannon I'm in my jammy-jams!
andy_bernard That's okay, I'm in my "worky-works." You look amazing!
erin_hannon Oh, thanks. Come in!
meredith_palmer Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
kevin_malone Oh I'm in.
oscar_martinez I'm in.
meredith_palmer All right.
jo_bennett Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!
dwight_schrute Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.
dwight_schrute Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening I have...
jo_bennett Hello?
jim_halpert Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7 30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
jo_bennett Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.
jim_halpert You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
jo_bennett Okay.
jim_halpert Okay.
jo_bennett Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?
dwight_schrute Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
jo_bennett Thank you.
jim_halpert Thanks again by the way.
darryl_philbin Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode19 guy 1 We're here to bust you out!
darryl_philbin I wish, but uh-
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode19 guy 1 Dude! Your shirt tucked in?
darryl_philbin Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom. All right then, uh, let me get to it.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode19 guy 1 All right.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode19 guy 2 See you later.
erin_hannon Your hand's cold.
andy_bernard It is? I'm sorry.
erin_hannon Yeah, have some more blanket.
andy_bernard Okay, thanks.
reed What's up?
andy_bernard Whoa!
erin_hannon You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
andy_bernard I didn't know you had a brother.
erin_hannon He's my foster brother.
andy_bernard Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard.
reed Cold hands.
andy_bernard Are we rotating seats, or?
reed Oh yeah, you're the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet.
erin_hannon Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them!
reed Ooh!
andy_bernard So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
erin_hannon None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
andy_bernard All right. Formative years.
reed Nice skirt.
andy_bernard Yeah, it's a kilt.
Night#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode19 cleaning crew Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry.
angela_martin Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
jo_bennett Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves. I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.
michael_scott How late do we have to work tonight?
gabe_lewis You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
michael_scott Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
gabe_lewis Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right? I will date when I'm dead!
michael_scott Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
michael_scott Hello Jo.
jo_bennett Anything I can do for you Puddin'?
michael_scott There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8 30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
jo_bennett Hmm.
michael_scott I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
jo_bennett All right then.
michael_scott Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
jo_bennett Michael?
michael_scott Yes.
jo_bennett I look forward to that too.
andy_bernard Ooh. It's coming down out there.
erin_hannon Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
andy_bernard No, I-
erin_hannon I'm so sorry I was so sick.
andy_bernard Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick.
michael_scott Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
meredith_palmer Creed, Oscar and Matt
michael_scott Drinks are on me!
oscar_martinez No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
michael_scott Oh -hoh! All right.
michael_scott Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, "Don't worry, be happy."
todd_packer Packer Whoops!
michael_scott Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. What the hell is going on back there?
jim_halpert Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. Thank you.
dwight_schrute What the hell is this?
jim_halpert Oh!
dwight_schrute This is not Mega-Desk.
jim_halpert No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
dwight_schrute That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
jim_halpert Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we?
dwight_schrute Hello, Dwight Schrute?
