oscar Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
phyllis What's he doing?
dwight He's searching out younger gays.
phyllis Oh.
oscar No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
dwight . with you.
oscar No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
kelly Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
oscar Do you not own a mirror?
kelly Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
pam I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
kelly I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
oscar Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
robert No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
oscar It's not misleading.
robert -pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as "normal. " It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
kevin Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. Ooh!
robert Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!
dwight You okay, Robert?
robert Fine.
dwight Put some ice on it.
oscar In any case, it gets better. Maybe- maybe not much better. but better.
sasha One, two, three!
dwight I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, "muffin basket. " Then I thought, "What's even more precious to people than muffins?"
jake Can you just smile, please?
meredith I don't want to!
dwight . their own children.
dwight Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
angela No thank you.
dwight Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
jim I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
jim Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And. you can fill in the rest.
dwight Wha-? Damn it, Jim!
jim Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
darryl Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
hide Bad economy. Bad investment.
darryl You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
calvin They did not.
darryl And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
calvin I wouldn't.
darryl Aw, come on. What's the harm? Mmm. What flavor was that?
hide Coconut pen1s.
darryl The coconut's pretty subtle.
calvin Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no?
darryl I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- ooh, hold on a second. Oh.
darryl If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
andy Hi guys.
jim How's it going, man?
andy I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
jim Great, yeah, good.
gabe Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
nellie Oh God.
andy Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants.
nellie No, you don't understand-
andy Clean the toilets.
nellie I don't need anyone to-
andy Pull the poop out of the toilets.
nellie That's not even a thing.
andy Just, please.
nellie Andy.
andy Please!
nellie Andy.
andy Give me something!
nellie Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
andy Thank you.
nellie You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
andy Thank you.
nellie You don't need to-
andy I have a delicious secret.
creed Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
jim Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
andy Yeah, it is actually.
andy Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced david Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
pam Family picture!
jim Pam? No!
pam What? Honey, we talked about this.
jim No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
pam Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
jim No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
pam No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
jim Nope.
pam We decided that there's no way dwight would harm a child.
jim But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
pam No, no.
jim Nope.
pam But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
jim That's-
pam Yes!
jim That's-
pam And we'll make sure dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
jim Okay.
kevin Wait, C-R-A-Z.
dwight Great, right up there.
pam Yeah?
jim Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
pam Okay.
jim Alright. Why don't you just-
pam Oh, great. Thank you.
jim -give him to me and. perfect.
pam Okay.
jim This is great.
pam You ready?
jim Excuse me.
pam There we go.
jim Just do it.
pam I'll just stand here?
jim Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
photographer Sir, could you look into the camera?
jim Let's do it, shoot it.
photographer Sir.
jim Great.
dwight Up here.
jim Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
dwight Jim, right here, right here. Okay, good.
jim Oh, so that's it?
dwight That's it.
pam See? That wasn't so hard.
dwight Cute kids, thanks for coming. Senator
lipton Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody.
angela Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing? Senator
lipton Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op.
phyllis Yeah.
angela Heh.
erin Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. Senator
lipton Thanks.
dwight Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
angela Dwight.
dwight Nice to see you. May I hold him? Senator
lipton Sure.
angela No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
angela I think that dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which. is impossible. because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
angela See the duckie!
dwight Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place. Senator
lipton Oh, thank you.
angela No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
dwight Really?
andy This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. It's go time.
andy Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
nellie Well, I don't want any soup.
andy But it's really good- Oh!
nellie Oh come on, Andy! . push;
erin I know this is going to be a great payoff.
andy A delicious moment.
erin But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
andy Well, but it-
erin Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
dwight Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
angela Uh-uh, leave us alone. Senator
lipton I guess we're okay with the fingernails.
dwight Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
angela Dwight, we're fine! Senator
lipton Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?
angela Oh no. Senator
lipton I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
dwight He defecated, aw. Senator
lipton You're stinky.
darryl A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
brandon That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that.
val Uh, Brandon?
darryl I would.
brandon You would?
darryl Yeah.
brandon Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend.
val Calm down, he's not.
darryl Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
brandon So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
val Brandon!
darryl Good slam.
brandon Thank you, Biggie.
darryl Good luck to you.
brandon Oh, and have a burger for me. Senator
lipton Okay, shall we take a few more?
angela I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight. Senator
lipton Okay. There we go.
angela No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
dwight Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
toby Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
nellie You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
andy I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
jim No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk.
erin No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
nellie What?
pam You hit her?
andy No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
erin He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
andy That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
gabe Happy birthday to Gabe!
nellie Oh, get out, skeleton man!
toby I can refer you to someone to talk to.
andy Huh? Hold on.
toby Give you a name or-
andy I just gonna- quick- Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday. that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
jim Oh boy.
pam Oh, Andy.
oscar What?
andy I'm not crazy. I convinced david Wallace to give me my job back.
oscar david Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
andy Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw david at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It" to the U. S. military.
jim Andy, come on.
kevin Even I know that's weird.
andy I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
toby Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
andy Stop saying my name.
erin No, he's not making this up.
andy Thank you, Erin.
erin andy tells me about seeing david Wallace all the time.
pam But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
erin Oh my God.
andy Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to david Wallace.
toby Do you see david Wallace in the room right now?
dwight Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
kelly Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
ravi I do adore you.
robert Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this.
andy Yeah, I know.
robert Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.
jim Hey.
others Hey!
david Hey guys, long time.
pam David, what are you doing here?
phyllis Is it true you're buying the company?
david Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
andy What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
david I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
andy But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
david Yes, as we've discussed-
andy What?
david But it's very possible-
andy Oh my God!
david Probable.
andy Wow. From janitor to manager?
david Yep.
andy That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
david There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
andy From total loss to total boss, I mean-
stanley Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
david Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
andy I was so looking forward to that and it did not. go as I thought it would.
phyllis So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
david Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
robert Oof. Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. I'm actually the CEO.
david Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
robert Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.
david Well, okay. Great to meet you.
robert Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis.
david Pleasure.
robert I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
david That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
robert Please.
andy Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
jim Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
andy Gosh, I hope so.
angela No! God, Mose! God!
mose Hi, Angela.
angela Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
mose I'm not supposed to say.
angela Yes! Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
darryl Let's see that smile. Go on.
val Right here?
darryl Cool.
andy Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
nellie May I say one thing?
andy It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
nellie The quality of mercy is not strained.
andy No.
nellie It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
andy Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
nellie It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
andy I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
andy If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
nellie Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
andy All right, you sly b*st*rd. When can you start?
david Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
meredith Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
david But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
robert david has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
david I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
robert Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
andy Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
robert Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.
andy Mm. Mm-hmm.
robert It's been a great year.
dwight Hello.
angela Where is it?
dwight They're testing it now.
angela How long does it take to get the results?
dwight Seventy-two hours.
angela You're gonna wait here?
dwight Yes.
angela Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight! Senator
lipton Hey.
oscar Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you? Senator
lipton You didn't call.
oscar Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me. Senator
lipton You know what this is about. Call.
