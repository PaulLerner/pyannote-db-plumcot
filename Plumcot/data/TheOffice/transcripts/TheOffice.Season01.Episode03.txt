michael_scott Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
pam_beesly I'm not making any copies.
michael_scott Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
pam_beesly Nothing new.
michael_scott Lay them on me. What?
pam_beesly There's nothing new.
michael_scott That's not what you said earlier.
pam_beesly Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the...
michael_scott The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
jan_levinson So, which health plan have you decided on?
michael_scott I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
jan_levinson Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
michael_scott I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
jan_levinson The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
michael_scott Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott You gotta crack these things open.
jan_levinson You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
michael_scott Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
jan_levinson It's your job. So...
michael_scott Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
jan_levinson Michael... maybe... I mean...
michael_scott There, there...
jan_levinson Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
michael_scott When have you ever done that?
jan_levinson I'm doing it right now. To you.
jim_halpert Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?
pam_beesly No. I have a life.
jim_halpert Interesting, what's that like?
pam_beesly You should try it sometime.
jim_halpert Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
pam_beesly ... your problem.
michael_scott Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
michael_scott There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
jim_halpert Gosh.
michael_scott Yeah!
jim_halpert That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
michael_scott Really?
jim_halpert Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
jim_halpert Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
dwight_schrute Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
jim_halpert Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
dwight_schrute OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
michael_scott Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
dwight_schrute OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
michael_scott You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
dwight_schrute Yes, I have an office. Bigger than his.
michael_scott Nope, you cannot use it.
dwight_schrute OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
michael_scott Temporary workspace. You can use it.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
michael_scott If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.
dwight_schrute What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
dwight_schrute In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead." Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
stanley_hudson There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael_scott Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
pam_beesly Where are you?
michael_scott Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
pam_beesly Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...
michael_scott Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
pam_beesly No you're not.
michael_scott I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
pam_beesly OK.
michael_scott Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
pam_beesly Still no one calling.
pam_beesly Dwight, what...
dwight_schrute Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
jim_halpert It says "workspace".
dwight_schrute Same thing.
jim_halpert If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
dwight_schrute Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
jim_halpert You are not my superior.
dwight_schrute Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
jim_halpert I thought it was a workspace?
pam_beesly OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
dwight_schrute Yes. And my decision in final.
pam_beesly This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
dwight_schrute Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
jim_halpert You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
dwight_schrute Sure.
jim_halpert Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
dwight_schrute Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
jim_halpert OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
dwight_schrute I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
pam_beesly Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
dwight_schrute So I can lower it.
oscar_martinez He literally won't come out of his office.
kevin_malone He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
angela_martin Kevin! That's inappropriate.
oscar_martinez Michael, can I talk to you?
michael_scott Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
meredith_palmer Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
michael_scott Ah, what? Which memo?
pam_beesly Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
michael_scott Is it a good plan?
dwight_schrute It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
oscar_martinez It's like a pay decrease.
pam_beesly Michael, he made huge cuts.
michael_scott Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
dwight_schrute Yeah, you said...
michael_scott No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
dwight_schrute I can handle that.
michael_scott OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
oscar_martinez This is not good.
angela_martin It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
oscar_martinez What was that?
angela_martin You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
kevin_malone What are you guys talking about?
angela_martin Nothing, Kevin.
michael_scott Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.
dwight_schrute OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
jim_halpert OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
dwight_schrute OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
jim_halpert Workspace.
michael_scott You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
pam_beesly Where are you going?
michael_scott Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. Couldn't find the knob.
michael_scott So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
travel_agent Agent I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?
michael_scott Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
jim_halpert Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
pam_beesly I'm inventing new diseases.
jim_halpert Oh, great.
pam_beesly So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
jim_halpert I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
pam_beesly Nice.
jim_halpert Thank you.
michael_scott Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season01.Episode03 on Phone You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.
michael_scott Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season01.Episode03 on Phone It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
michael_scott So it's not a free fall?
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season01.Episode03 on Phone It's an industrial coal elevator.
michael_scott Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
michael_scott OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
dwight_schrute Damnit! Damnit Jim!
dwight_schrute All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
jim_halpert What are you talking about?
dwight_schrute Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
jim_halpert OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
dwight_schrute Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
dwight_schrute You did this, didn't you?
jim_halpert Absolutely not.
dwight_schrute Yes you did.
jim_halpert No I didn't.
dwight_schrute I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
jim_halpert Killer nanorobots?
pam_beesly It's an epidemic.
dwight_schrute The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. "Count Choculitis"
jim_halpert Sounds tough.
dwight_schrute Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
jim_halpert Do you?
dwight_schrute I think you need to confess...
jim_halpert Mmm hmm.
dwight_schrute ...the fact...
jim_halpert Yep.
dwight_schrute What are you doing? Those are my keys.
jim_halpert Good luck.
dwight_schrute Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...
stanley_hudson ...the light green or green...
jim_halpert Jim Halpert.
dwight_schrute Let me out.
jim_halpert Who is this?
dwight_schrute Let me out or you're fired.
jim_halpert No, you can't fire me.
dwight_schrute Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
jim_halpert OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. ] Jim Halpert.
pam_beesly Hey, Jim. It's Pam.
jim_halpert Hey Pam! How are you?
dwight_schrute Jim! Open the door!
pam_beesly Good, how are you? Busy?
jim_halpert I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
dwight_schrute Jim!
pam_beesly Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?
jim_halpert No, not at all.
pam_beesly You don't have anything you're doing?
jim_halpert I have nothing to do.
dwight_schrute Jim!
pam_beesly Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
dwight_schrute Jim!
jim_halpert Oh yeah?
pam_beesly I might go to the mall.
jim_halpert The mall?
dwight_schrute Jim!
pam_beesly I need new shoes.
jim_halpert Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
jan_levinson Hello?
dwight_schrute Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
jan_levinson This is Jan.
dwight_schrute Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
jan_levinson Who is this?
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute.
jan_levinson From sales?
dwight_schrute Well...
jan_levinson Where's Michael Scott?
dwight_schrute He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
jan_levinson Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
dwight_schrute That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
jan_levinson Really?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
jan_levinson OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
dwight_schrute Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
jan_levinson No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
dwight_schrute Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your...
michael_scott Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
ryan_howard Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the...
michael_scott Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
stanley_hudson Oh, thanks.
michael_scott There you go.
stanley_hudson This isn't the big surprise, is it? Because we've been having a pretty horrible day.
michael_scott Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
dwight_schrute Michael. Michael?
michael_scott Oh, Christ.
dwight_schrute I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
dwight_schrute I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
stanley_hudson What about confidentiality?
dwight_schrute You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted pen1s.
meredith_palmer Could you mean v*g1n*? Because if you do, I want that covered.
dwight_schrute I thought your v*g1n* was removed during your hysterectomy?
meredith_palmer A uterus is different from a v*g1n*. I still have a v*g1n*.
dwight_schrute OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?
kevin_malone That's a real thing.
dwight_schrute Yeah, but no one here has it.
kevin_malone Someone has it.
kevin_malone Do you think we should go ?
oscar_martinez I don't know, Kevin. This is important. I don't want... There he is.
kevin_malone What is he doing?
oscar_martinez I don't know.
oscar_martinez Well?
michael_scott Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
oscar_martinez OK, the health care plan.
pam_beesly Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
michael_scott Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
dwight_schrute I most certainly did not.
michael_scott Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
angela_martin What about the surprise?
michael_scott Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
stanley_hudson We all think you don't have a surprise.
michael_scott All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
michael_scott When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.
michael_scott God, yeah... Ah! This...
michael_scott Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
dwight_schrute Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
