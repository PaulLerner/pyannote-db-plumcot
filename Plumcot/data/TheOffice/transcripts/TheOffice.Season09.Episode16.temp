 15 . push; david
wallace . No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
andy I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
david Really? "Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA. "
andy And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
david "By the way, oscar says 'hi'"
andy oscar says "hi" all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. "Hi" "Hello" "Hola" You're telling me you've never heard oscar say "hi"?
david Andy.
andy But you're calling me a liar.
david Andy!
andy By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
david Watch it Andy!
andy Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. "Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick. " Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
david My wife?
andy This has been a really tough time.
david Yeah?
andy Yeah.
david Has it?
andy erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
david Shh.
andy It was like a security blan-
david Andy.
andy -ket
david Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
andy You're not?
david No.
andy That's awesome.
david I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So. I owe you that.
andy David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J. B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
david We are even. now. Understand? Got it?
andy Crystal.
david You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
andy Vanilla. Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
andy Good morning.
erin Good morning.
andy And how are you on this fine-
andy Ok, we ready? Don't use that part. Last week, erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is. brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
andy Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
pam He sounds like a wounded animal.
stanley Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
phyllis I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
stanley I'm the same way with horny people.
pam Ok.
erin Yes. pete and I have started seeing each other and andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
pam Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
pam jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
dwight No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
dwight I need you.
angela Ahh! Dwight!
dwight And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
angela What? What is it?
dwight It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
angela Dwight, that's awful.
dwight You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by Aunt Shirley.
angela What do you mean by "poisoned"?
dwight Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
angela Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
dwight Thank you.
angela But I don't see how this is my problem.
dwight Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
angela Ugh.
dwight And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
angela Gah.
dwight There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
angela It's fine.
dwight It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
angela Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
dwight It's a divet.
angela I'll help you!
dwight . where it was and it needs, it needs a.
angela Ugh.
andy Where are you going?
pam Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
andy Wha? Oh, burn. Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
dwight How dare you?
andy I'm still the boss!
erin I.
andy The answer is yes.
erin . just have some messages for you.
andy Are they from you?
erin Well no, they're from clients.
andy Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
erin I can't. I-
andy Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
erin These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
andy I don't want to talk about work right now.
erin Well I only want to talk about work right now.
andy Then I want my big blue sweater back.
erin Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
pete I've got the seat adjusted right.
clark Perfect height, yeah.
andy She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
pete I was just leaving.
andy Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the
sitch erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
pete I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
andy Survey
says ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero clark Thirty, what do you got?
clark Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
andy Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
clark There you go, good for you.
andy No.
clark You just let it all hang out, that's what.
andy May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you.
clark I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
dwight Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
shirley Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight.
angela Hello Aunt Shirley.
shirley Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch.
dwight This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
shirley New clothes? What for?
dwight OK
angela Oh, God.
dwight You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
angela Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
shirley How would you like a mean cold slap?
angela Ow!
dwight Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
shirley I could do that.
dwight Ok.
angela No. No.
dwight Yeah, trust me.
angela No.
dwight It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
shirley Step on it!
andy Why doesn't erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
phyllis Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
andy I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
oscar You're clearly snooping.
creed That's kinda uncool, man.
meredith Ah, come on.
phyllis Andy!
oscar That's her private property.
meredith Tell us!
andy Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?
phyllis What does that even mean?
meredith What's it say?
phyllis Put it down.
andy Everyone please, just-
creed It's not cool.
phyllis Put it down
oscar Andy. That is her private property.
meredith Boo.
andy Oh my god.
stanley Uh huh.
phyllis See?
stanley That's where nosey'll get you.
phyllis Told you so.
andy Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
darryl Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
andy Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
kevin Pete.
clark Hmm.
kevin pete what?
pete It just occurred to me that andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
pam hello!
jim Hey! There she is. How you doin?
pam Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
jim You look great.
pam Ok
jim Yeah.
pam What's that? Is that a-
jim Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.
isaac Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door.
pam How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
isaac It's a phone?
pam Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
isaac Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You're gonna crush it, Pam.
pam Thanks.
jim You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
pam Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
jim Call you right back. What were you saying?
pam Ha ha. Athlead
coworker Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line.
jim I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it. OK, good luck!
pam Bye.
angela Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
dwight In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
shirley 
dwight Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
angela Spray her down?
dwight No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
pete Hey.
andy Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted shlmydia. from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
pete Yeah. You were gone.
andy I knew it!
pete For a long time, Andy.
andy You and erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
pete Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
andy No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
pete What?
andy Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. So you had a bad day-
pete Andy?
andy . The camera don't lie!
pete Andy.
andy You're being an idiot get.
pete I'm trying.
andy Out of my office, turns out you're fired.
pete Andy.
andy Because you suck.
pete You can't fire-
andy And you're fired.
pete If you want to talk to me
andy So you had a bad day.
pete I'll be in the annex.
andy Rut ti doh doh.
pete Alright? I'll be in the annex.
andy Rut tit doh doh.
pete Toby!
andy Rut ti doh doo doh
pete Toby?
toby You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
andy No.
toby Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
andy nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
toby Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for pete &amp; Erin.
andy They already have a contract? "Mutually agree to-" Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
toby It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
andy Well, I'm not signing away my rights.
toby I already signed it. I was just showing you.
andy Ok, well we'll see about that.
toby Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. It's the original.
mark . talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting. Is that her? Hey guys! Say something.
pam Hello.
mark Hi, I'm Mark.
pam Hi, Pam, hello.
mark I'm the horrible boss around here, but please don't hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D'Jango! I don't agree with the use of the "N" word in that movie. It's, it's too soon.
pam I'm pam Halpert.
mark Oh, hi. They call me Marky mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style. He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it?
pam Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
shirley Time to get clean!
dwight It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
angela You have to use chains?
dwight You'll see. Here we go.
shirley Let's get this show on the road.
dwight Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
angela Dwight!
dwight Let's get to it.
angela No! No!
dwight Give it a whirl.
angela Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
shirley Stop your belly-aching and hose me.
dwight I need you to hose my aunt.
angela No Dwight!
dwight OK you are useless.
angela No, Dwight!
dwight Give me the hose!
angela No Dwight, I won't-
dwight Ahh! OK!
angela I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
dwight Yes ma'am.
angela Good.
mark This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok?
toby Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
nellie Um.
toby Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial.
nellie Oh no.
toby . feel like I may have glossed over a few.
nellie No no no no.
toby . minor points.
nellie No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
toby I've been drafting a letter.
nellie For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it! . push;
mark My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this. work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say "Chillax" people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me.
roger No. I heard you.
mark Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.
pam Oh my god.
andy Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
meredith Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk. .
andy Ugh.
meredith Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
phyllis Come on Andy, they're a good match.
andy That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
darryl Hey, Andy.
andy What?!
darryl You've got a booger bubble going on there.
andy Sorry.
darryl It's ok.
andy My whole life is a booger bubble!
mark This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom. From The Smurfs movie.
pam Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
mark What does this say here? To ti te per tat. what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it.
pam Oh, cause it was upside down.
mark You're a good audience.
pam So um-
mark Unlike some of these people around here.
pam Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
mark Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don't jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean. you think they like me, Pam?
pam Yes.
mark What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I'm gonna do Dylan! pam Halpert is my name, and I've been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute. You have children?
pam Two children, yes.
mark You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so. leave that be.
pete Hey. You got a sec to talk?
andy Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole.
translation pen1s. Translation? My manhood.
pete Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
andy Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
erin Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
andy Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
pete Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
erin See? We can all be friends!
pete Yeah.
erin Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
pete I do think we can have a fair. .
andy Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
mark Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So.
pam I am not pr-
mark You're not.
pam Pregnant, no.
mark I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.
pam Wow.
mark Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-
pam I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
mark It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.
pam So, kinda like a receptionist.
mark Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?
pam Yes.
mark Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted.
pam I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
shirley Ow! The braid is too tight.
angela Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
shirley Yes ma'am.
angela I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
shirley Ok.
angela There.
shirley Thank you Angela.
toby I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
nellie Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
darryl Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
toby Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it.
nellie He's doing it.
pam hey!
jim Hey, how'd the interview go?
pam Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
jim I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
pam Eight? Really?
jim I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
pam Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
jim Alright, love you.
pam Love you.
alice Hi.
erin Hi.
alice I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.
erin Yes. The consultant. andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
alice Ok, great. Thanks.
meredith Fresh meat! Fresh meat!
erin Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm erin by the way.
alice Nice to meet you. Cute sweater.
erin Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
kevin I'm Kevin.
alice Pete?
pete Alice. Oh man.
alice It's uh, been a while, huh?
erin What, do you two know each other?
pete Yeah. We uh, have a history.
erin Oh.
alice History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years.
erin That's so random.
pete Well. Is it?
erin andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no.
creed Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
gabe Hello beautiful.
kevin Didn't you two used to do it?
gabe We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
creed She's looking good.
toby Hi, I'm uh, toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
toby This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? I think this is a start of my first friendship.
clark So pete was a librarian?
alice He worked as a librarian freshman year.
clark Was he like the sexy librarian?
pete Ok.
alice Is there like somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her.
andy Hi.
alice Hi.
andy Hi, how's it going?
alice Hi. Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p-
andy Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
pete Andy, that is really inappropriate.
andy Awkward.
pete It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
andy Really uncomfortable situation.
pete Yeah.
andy It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta "move on". Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm.
alice So there's no marketing department.
clark No.
pete No.
gabe You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
erin So andy just called you up out of the blue?
gabe Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
erin Yeah.
gabe You must be pretty horny.
nellie well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? One week? Ok, two weeks? Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
shirley I feel like a show pony.
dwight And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
angela You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
dwight By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
angela Mmhm.
dwight Would you like the stink sack?
angela Is it any good?
dwight No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
angela Thank you.
shirley So, when's the wedding?
angela Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
shirley That's what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.
pam Hello?
jim Hey! Back here.
pam Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
jim Si, senor.
pam Oh, jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
jim Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
pam Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
jim Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
pam You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
jim Alright. So, tell me all about it.
dwight Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
angela It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. Dwight, Dwight.
dwight Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
angela No, Dwight. The Senator.
dwight Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
angela I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
dwight I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life. I want to spend with you.
angela I made a vow. I gave my word.
dwight Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
angela Good night, D.
erin How are you doing? Is it really rough?
pete It is so unpleasant. You?
andy Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
andy Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
gabe Honestly, it was a little weird.
andy Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because erin and pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and erin used to be an item?
gabe I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
erin Gabe!
gabe . a lot of the time.
andy And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
pete Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
alice Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem.
pete It was college. That is what you do.
alice Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that.
erin Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
andy We'll get to that. Gabe, did erin ever tell you that she loves you?
gabe Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
erin Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
gabe I got a tattoo for you.
erin I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
gabe Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
alice So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete.
pete She's nice to me.
alice How's that P. E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher.
erin Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
gabe I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.

erin Gabe, I don't-
gabe Give me one night with you.
erin What is that supposed to mean?
