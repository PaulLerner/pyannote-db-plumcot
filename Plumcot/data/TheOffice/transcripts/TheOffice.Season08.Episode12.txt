dwight_schrute Oh, ugh. What is this, a meatball? Really?
jim_halpert It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.
dwight_schrute Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the-
stanley_hudson You've been meatballed!
dwight_schrute Ugh.
stanley_hudson Are you ready for some meatball?
dwight_schrute Aw, man. This is not very clever, Jim.
jim_halpert I know.
stanley_hudson Look for your stapler!
dwight_schrute Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
stanley_hudson Oh okay. Good night. What's the haul?
dwight_schrute Thirty-two meatballs.
stanley_hudson Good day.
dwight_schrute That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
stanley_hudson We'll never have to buy meatballs again.
erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin. Jessica, hi! How are you? Oh yay, that's so great to hear.
erin_hannon I'm not going to be one of those exes who can't move on. They have their life and I have mine. I'm taking an Italian class. So far I've learned tortellini, spagettini, linguini... Well it's not so much a class as a restaurant, but I do Monday, Wednesday, Friday from seven to nine.
erin_hannon I will patch you through right now. You sound really pretty today. Okay.
andy_bernard Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.
andy_bernard My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...
jim_halpert Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.
oscar_martinez Oh, who needs a house that size?
dwight_schrute Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
robert_california I'm selling the house, actually.
jim_halpert You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
robert_california It's mid-recession in a depressed area of a faltering state and I've got the most expensive house on the market. The one percent are suffering too, people. I wanted it to be my Playboy mansion. A temple to wine, revelry, s*x, intrigue... this was hot on the heels of Eyes Wide Shut, mind you. Then I met my wife, she moved in, made it her own. Now she's left me and forced me to sell the place. The ultimate insult? They're calling my speakeasy lounge a rumpus room. Does my turmoil amuse you, Jim?
jim_halpert I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
robert_california What could you possibly have found funny in what I said? What was the joke you thought you heard?
jim_halpert I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
robert_california Oh yes. How hilarious it is to laugh at clowns, the painted jesters of the dying circus industry. Very funny, Jim. I get it.
andy_bernard Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.
robert_california A beautiful monster cost me my forties and my dream home. I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.
andy_bernard Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.
kevin_malone Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight and check out your indoor pool?
oscar_martinez Kevin, no.
robert_california What, as some sort of last hoorah?
kevin_malone Yeah. All of us in the pool, saying hoorah. Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.
robert_california You know I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this everyone, tonight, my house, wear a swimsuit. Let's just call it a get-together. And let's say no food.
kevin_malone Hey Oscar, was that you who just created a party out of thin air or was it me?
oscar_martinez That was you, Kevin.
kevin_malone It was me.
meredith_palmer You going tonight, kiddo? Cause I can give you a lift.
erin_hannon Oh, I don't know, Meredith. It seems like you shouldn't drive maybe ever.
meredith_palmer It's no problem. You live right near me.
erin_hannon How do you know where I live?
meredith_palmer Andy followed you home after the Christmas party.
erin_hannon Why?
meredith_palmer He wanted to make sure California didn't put it in you.
erin_hannon Oh. Come on.
erin_hannon Wow. Andy's such a weird stalker. Following me home like that when he has a girlfriend? I should get a restraining order.
angela_martin Oh, it is warm.
cathy_simms It's almost too warm.
gabe_lewis I'm feeling eighty-two, eighty-two and a half.
ryan_howard Oh, so close. Eighty-one.
gabe_lewis Well, we'll say its eight-two and it'll be our secret.
cathy_simms Hey, late guy.
jim_halpert Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
andy_bernard Oh.
jim_halpert DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
jim_halpert You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.
jim_halpert Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.
robert_california You should see the whole thing.
jim_halpert I bet I should. That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
robert_california I'm just about to give the tour.
jim_halpert All right-
robert_california Join us. You must see what you were laughing about.
jim_halpert I must...
jessica Wow.
andy_bernard Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.
jessica What are you doing?
andy_bernard Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener.
jessica Gross. I'm getting a drink. Do you want anything?
andy_bernard No, I'm good.
erin_hannon Funny how we can be surrounded by people and still feel so lonely. Hi.
andy_bernard Hi.
erin_hannon How is everything? How's your car?
andy_bernard It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.
erin_hannon Is that so? How about this weekend we take that sucker to a duck pond or something? Maybe get caught in the rain?
andy_bernard Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.
erin_hannon Oh, like a goodbye trip.
andy_bernard No. What?
jessica Hey.
erin_hannon Hi.
erin_hannon I guess Andy isn't totally over his current girlfriend. But, if he was jealous once before then maybe I can make him jealous again. Just not with Robert. He told me he was a ride I wouldn't survive, and I believe him.
darryl_philbin Val. You made it.
val Yup, yup.
darryl_philbin Uh oh, look at this. Red plastic cup, red plastic cup. How about that?
val You know, you are just as dumb at night.
darryl_philbin Mmm.
andy_bernard All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.
jessica No, show me.
andy_bernard Okay.
jessica Dive in right here.
andy_bernard In a minute. In a minute.
jessica Okay. You don't know what you're doing.
andy_bernard A minute would be cool.
erin_hannon Hey, Dwight Snoot.
dwight_schrute What-
erin_hannon What you doing?
dwight_schrute I'm relaxing. Scram.
erin_hannon Ow.
andy_bernard Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?
stanley_hudson I moved them. Pants only need a chair if there's a person in them.
andy_bernard Where...
erin_hannon Come on, don't you want to play?
dwight_schrute Oh really?
erin_hannon Yeah.
dwight_schrute Yeah, you want to play you little hick?
kevin_malone Whoa.
angela_martin Dwight! Oh my gosh! Dwight!
robert_california Here we have the parlor. I imagined people would set down their coats and symbolically their inhibitions. This was the gateway. You enter this room a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher, a judge, but beyond it you're simply a pen1s, a v*g1n*, hunger, ache. Susan used it as a Pilates studio.
oscar_martinez Holy cow!
robert_california Wine collection.
oscar_martinez How many bottles? Three hundred?
robert_california About twelve hundred. What the hell, grab a bottle. Less inventory for the lawyers.
oscar_martinez Toby! Chateau Margaux ninety-five. You know your wine.
toby_flenderson Well, and you have a... yes, a- d- another chateau.
ryan_howard Robert, you are too kind.
robert_california Oh.
gabe_lewis Too kind doesn't begin to cover it.
ryan_howard With ammunition like this we are in for quite a night, you and me.
gabe_lewis And Gabe-y makes three.
jim_halpert Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
robert_california Jim, come see this next room. I think you especially would like it.
jim_halpert Really? Why?
robert_california I don't know. Maybe not. Just come.
erin_hannon Oh!
dwight_schrute You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
erin_hannon Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
dwight_schrute I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it.
erin_hannon Oh Dwight!
erin_hannon Stop.
dwight_schrute You stop.
erin_hannon No, you stop.
dwight_schrute No, you stop.
erin_hannon Is he looking? Oh. You can stop.
dwight_schrute Okay, you can stop.
erin_hannon No, no, no, he's not looking.
dwight_schrute No, you can stop.
erin_hannon You can actually stop.
kelly_kapoor Whoa, you guys, I just found this insane engagement ring. Is anyone missing this?
meredith_palmer The main stone's missing.
kelly_kapoor I don't know. It looks pretty great to me.
robert_california I pictured myself here every night eating a leg of mutton, the juices dripping down my bare chest, wiping my fingers on the walls. Then I met the vegan.
jim_halpert Good night.
oscar_martinez To the kitchen!
all@ To the kitchen!
robert_california To the kitchen. Onward!
oscar_martinez Toby, what's compelling about this is the note of persimmon. Right?
toby_flenderson Note? It's a symphony.
oscar_martinez Okay, you have to join my wine-tasting club.
toby_flenderson I would love that.
toby_flenderson Toby, you are playing a dangerous game. Guess I'm through the gateway now, though, right?
darryl_philbin You know, I don't think I've ever been in this exact angle before. I was scared at first, but I like it.
meredith_palmer You guys got to try this pool. No top scum, no band-aids. This thing is choice.
val You in?
darryl_philbin Yeah, sure, sure. I'll be right in.
darryl_philbin I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
dwight_schrute Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
erin_hannon Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
dwight_schrute Damn it.
erin_hannon What is the most romantic possible thing?
dwight_schrute We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
erin_hannon Dwight, that's just- that's really perfect. Thank you.
all@ Yes!
angela_martin You're in my way!
erin_hannon Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
dwight_schrute Chicken fight!
andy_bernard No thanks.
erin_hannon Dang it! What the heck already?
dwight_schrute Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
cathy_simms Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?
kevin_malone I'm right here! Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
dwight_schrute Yeah- oh!
erin_hannon Yes! Woo!
dwight_schrute Woohoo! Yes!
erin_hannon Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
dwight_schrute I know. I could just bang you right now.
erin_hannon He's not looking. Hey!
robert_california I had two bears sewn together to make this king-size. Total waste of two bears.
jim_halpert To both these bears.
ryan_howard To both these bears.
toby_flenderson Bears.
oscar_martinez To both these bears.
robert_california When I put in the screening room, I bought three movies Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2. Last two movies I actually watched in here Marley and Me and On Golden Pond.
ryan_howard I mean, it's clearly meant for watching erotic cinema.
gabe_lewis Yup. We could watch some right now if you want. I got a Korean film on my iPod if you want to just- if you have the cables.
andy_bernard Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, thanks. I'm really glad I found it.
andy_bernard I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?
kelly_kapoor Shh. Of course I'm superstitious. What are you talking about?
andy_bernard The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?
phyllis_vance Oh, I don't think you're being silly.
kelly_kapoor Oh God.
andy_bernard You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.
phyllis_vance Then another woman will get it. We can't allow that. We have to destroy it.
jessica Come on. Let's chicken fight those two.
val How was that?
kevin_malone Okay. Watch my toes.
darryl_philbin Hey Val. Want a beer? It might taste better than that pool water you've been drinking.
val No, I'm good. Thank you.
darryl_philbin Cool.
val Cool. Does Darryl not swim?
kevin_malone That's racist! I don't know. But I would say, by looking at him, no, Darryl does not swim.
jessica Yes!
andy_bernard Yeah!
dwight_schrute Maybe we should take a little break.
erin_hannon Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
dwight_schrute Okay.
erin_hannon One more?
andy_bernard Yeah!
jessica Yeah! Great!
erin_hannon Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
dwight_schrute Go!
erin_hannon Go! Okay. Yeah.
jessica Here we go! Yes!
andy_bernard Yay! Whoa!
kevin_malone Wow!
andy_bernard I cannot believe you're still up!
jessica I cannot believe it either.
erin_hannon I've got this! Charge! Go! Go!
andy_bernard Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
dwight_schrute Erin, did we win?
erin_hannon Sure. Sure we did.
dwight_schrute You're lying. We didn't win.
erin_hannon Hey, hey, hey Dwight. It's okay. Just rest. Just rest.
kelly_kapoor You've broken up your last couple, you evil ring. Do it.
angela_martin We're in the pool!
meredith_palmer Shut it, Angela.
dwight_schrute Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
andy_bernard Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
dwight_schrute I know. But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
andy_bernard Mmm.
dwight_schrute So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
andy_bernard Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
dwight_schrute Not what I asked.
andy_bernard We're done. Erin and I are over.
dwight_schrute So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With s*x.
andy_bernard Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
dwight_schrute You're an idiot.
kevin_malone Kelly, that is mine! This is mine!
erin_hannon Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
kevin_malone No!
val Oh I've got him!
darryl_philbin Cannonball! Let's do this!
andy_bernard Wow.
erin_hannon So I kind of stepped on this. I think it's yours.
andy_bernard Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
erin_hannon The Bernard family seal. Duh.
andy_bernard Duh.
erin_hannon Sorry if your special night was ruined.
andy_bernard Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.
erin_hannon Oh, you weren't going to do that?
andy_bernard Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.
erin_hannon Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
robert_california And of course, the pool. The ultimate lubricant for any wild evening. It was here that my parties would have crescendoed into true madness.
jim_halpert To madness.
ryan_howard To madness.
toby_flenderson To madness.
meredith_palmer To madness.
jim_halpert Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
meredith_palmer Oh, I'm sorry. When I got here, I put my keys in a bowl.
jim_halpert Are you serious?
ryan_howard Robert, I want you to know, I'm here to rock with you as late as you want, man.
gabe_lewis And that goes double for me. I'll stay even later than you'd like.
oscar_martinez Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
toby_flenderson And I am Bacchus's friend!
robert_california Gentlemen, bear witness. While I've been mourning the nights that never were, one of them has been unfolding here before me. This is no get-together. This is a party.
all@ Yes! Woohoo! Bravo!
jim_halpert And there's my talking point.
robert_california Yes, that's it. Push yourselves, boys. It's not a party if you don't do something that scares you. I need a breather. Oh. Oh. You two keep going.
ryan_howard Hey, he's asleep. We can just leave.
gabe_lewis So leave.
