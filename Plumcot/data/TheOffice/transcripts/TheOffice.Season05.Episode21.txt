michael_scott It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company. Okay. Not gonna make this one.
jim_halpert LOVE the hair.
pam_beesly Morning Michael!
michael_scott Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride!
michael_scott I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
kelly_kapoor So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
jim_halpert You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
kelly_kapoor And...
charles_miner Hey Kelly?
kelly_kapoor Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
charles_miner Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly.
jim_halpert The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says "You wanted me" enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
charles_miner Oh, and Kelly...
kelly_kapoor Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
charles_miner Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
erin_hannon If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
charles_miner Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
kelly_kapoor Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
kevin_malone I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
michael_scott We are in the heart of it. And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
pam_beesly What should we do now?
michael_scott We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
michael_scott I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
michael_scott I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service.
pam_beesly I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
andy_bernard What do you think?
dwight_schrute Let me check. Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
andy_bernard Thank you!
dwight_schrute Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
ryan_howard You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
michael_scott Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
ryan_howard Please don't listen to my phone calls. Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
charles_miner Hey Jim can I get a, um-
jim_halpert Hi!
charles_miner Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
jim_halpert Sure!
charles_miner Yeah.
jim_halpert Okay.
jim_halpert What the hell's a rundown?
jim_halpert When did you need that rundown by?
charles_miner As soon as possible.
jim_halpert Okay.
charles_miner Just get it right.
jim_halpert Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
erin_hannon Oh.
dwight_schrute You know there's a ghost in this office
erin_hannon Really?
dwight_schrute A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
erin_hannon Why was she in this building?
dwight_schrute Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
erin_hannon That's crazy.
dwight_schrute Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
erin_hannon Oh my god!
dwight_schrute It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
erin_hannon Hmm.
dwight_schrute That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.
erin_hannon Oh!
dwight_schrute Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
erin_hannon Yeah.
dwight_schrute Yeah?
erin_hannon Just got some ice.
dwight_schrute Erin Erin...
andy_bernard Oh, this is awkward.
erin_hannon Oops!
andy_bernard Uh oh! Oh! Oh!
erin_hannon So I'll see you guys around!
dwight_schrute Hey buddy.
michael_scott Hey Ryan? Could you get to that copy from before?
ryan_howard Pam's better at that stuff
pam_beesly That is so insulting.
ryan_howard How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
pam_beesly Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
ryan_howard I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not saying one is better than the other.
pam_beesly Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
ryan_howard What the hell?
michael_scott Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
ryan_howard Yeah I make originals too.
pam_beesly Shut up!
michael_scott Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
pam_beesly Really!
ryan_howard Yeah!
toby_flenderson Not much? What's up with you? Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. Hey does blue go with tan?
michael_scott Would someone just make the copy?
toby_flenderson I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
michael_scott Just make that copy okay?
pam_beesly Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
ryan_howard That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
pam_beesly I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
ryan_howard You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
pam_beesly Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
ryan_howard This is from the sun.
pam_beesly Oh yeah I bet.
michael_scott They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
pam_beesly Michael, we can hear you.
michael_scott I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
pam_beesly Okay it's my turn.
ryan_howard No don't take that, give that back!
pam_beesly Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
ryan_howard I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
pam_beesly You're gonna make another "spreadsheet."
ryan_howard Yeah!
pam_beesly Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
ryan_howard Go make a copy, secretary.
pam_beesly Come on! Ryan!
michael_scott They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
dwight_schrute Hey buddy, what are you up to?
andy_bernard Um, nerthing?
dwight_schrute Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your pen1s.
andy_bernard Pffft.
dwight_schrute Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
andy_bernard The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
dwight_schrute And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
andy_bernard No, that's ridiculous.
dwight_schrute No no no.
andy_bernard Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
dwight_schrute Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, Boom.
michael_scott Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
pam_beesly Definitely.
michael_scott Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
pam_beesly We could work from home.
ryan_howard Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
michael_scott Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
pam_beesly .... Corner idea?
michael_scott No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house."
ryan_howard Rock the house!
pam_beesly How would we know that?
jim_halpert Hey dude, you know what a "rundown" is?
oscar_martinez Use it in a sentence.
jim_halpert "Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"
oscar_martinez Try another sentence.
jim_halpert "This rundown better be really good"?
oscar_martinez I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
jim_halpert Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
oscar_martinez Why don't you just ask him--
jim_halpert No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
oscar_martinez What have you been doing?
kevin_malone Try it in another sentence.
ryan_howard Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, "Hey cop, you like donuts?" then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. No, not that one.
michael_scott That's my corner.
pam_beesly I thought that was your corner.
michael_scott No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
pam_beesly So my corner's the one with the copier?
michael_scott Pam, I don't make the rules.
ryan_howard Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
charles_miner You started on that rundown yet?
jim_halpert Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
charles_miner Oh.
jim_halpert I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
charles_miner Okay, great.
jim_halpert Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
charles_miner Just keep it simple.
jim_halpert Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
charles_miner You're working hard? On this?
jim_halpert No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
charles_miner Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
jim_halpert No, I....
erin_hannon Can I help you?
pam_beesly No thanks.
jim_halpert Hey!
pam_beesly Hey I'm here to see Charles.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Hey Charles.
charles_miner Hey Pam.
pam_beesly I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
charles_miner I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
pam_beesly Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
charles_miner Um.
pam_beesly Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
charles_miner Yeah I know.
pam_beesly Personal shopper?
charles_miner No.
pam_beesly Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
charles_miner Okay.
pam_beesly I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
michael_scott Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
stanley_hudson I get it. You need to see more?
phyllis_vance It's really cute.
michael_scott Thank you. You remember Ryan And Pam is around here somewhere.
stanley_hudson She's upstairs talking to Charles.
michael_scott What for?
stanley_hudson I don't know.
ryan_howard Are we staying til five?
michael_scott Yes.
michael_scott Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
michael_scott Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. It's about
ryan_howard I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
michael_scott Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
michael_scott Hey Pam.
pam_beesly Hey.
michael_scott You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
pam_beesly Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
michael_scott Yeah?
pam_beesly That's as specific as I'd like to be.
michael_scott Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
jim_halpert There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
charles_miner Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
jim_halpert Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
charles_miner Do I need to?
jim_halpert No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
charles_miner What's that?
jim_halpert The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
jim_halpert Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
pam_beesly We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
angela_martin Do you have a card?
pam_beesly Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
creed_bratton These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
michael_scott These are shaped like paper.
creed_bratton Well I don't even want these.
meredith_palmer I'll take them for my kid.
erin_hannon Country roads, take me home, to the place... Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
dwight_schrute You're good.
erin_hannon Thank you.
andy_bernard That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like
erin_hannon Wow!
andy_bernard What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
dwight_schrute Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
andy_bernard Really?
dwight_schrute Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
dwight_schrute and Erin West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River
dwight_schrute In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
dwight_schrute and Andy Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.
dwight_schrute Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
toby_flenderson You have to stop.
michael_scott I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. It is a disgusting sandwich. And the reason I tell you this story. Pick up the phone.
pam_beesly Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
ryan_howard Keep going.
michael_scott Don't tell them we have free delivery!
pam_beesly We already offered free delivery!
michael_scott They don't know that!
pam_beesly Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
ryan_howard Write it down.

pam_beesly A guarantee of what?
michael_scott Just say the word.
pam_beesly And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.

ryan_howard Oh!
michael_scott You did!
pam_beesly Oh!
michael_scott Oh yeah!
ryan_howard We did it !
michael_scott She did it!
michael_scott Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
michael_scott Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.
andy_bernard Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
dwight_schrute Cherry Pie, Warrant.
