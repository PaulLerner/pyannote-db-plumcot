dwight_schrute Stop it!
jim_halpert Stop what?
dwight_schrute You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
jim_halpert Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
jim_halpert Yup. That's exactly what we did.
pam_beesly It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, "I will when you lose the baby weight."
dwight_schrute Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
michael_scott Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
jim_halpert It's a pen.
dwight_schrute Michael, come on.
michael_scott Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
dwight_schrute Fine. Hey. Tap away.
michael_scott Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
michael_scott Who enjoys the weekends? Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have s*x. Did I say that? Yes, I did. And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend. So just shout it out.
stanley_hudson I have an idea for your weekend.
michael_scott Okay.
stanley_hudson Let me get back to my desk right now.
michael_scott Okay, you get out of here, big dog. Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
pam_beesly Stanley got to go.
michael_scott Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
andy_bernard Walk around apple orchards.
michael_scott Oh!
andy_bernard Super romantic.
michael_scott That's fun.
dwight_schrute Eel fishing.
michael_scott All right.
darryl_philbin Curl up with your favorite DVD.
meredith_palmer You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
michael_scott We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
kelly_kapoor Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
michael_scott Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
kelly_kapoor Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
michael_scott You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
ryan_howard Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
michael_scott You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
pam_beesly No, Michael, no.
dwight_schrute Are you nuts?
pam_beesly You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
michael_scott ... and... we had s*x, too.
pam_beesly That is right. Don't make any more of it.
michael_scott How?
pam_beesly How what?
michael_scott How do I not make any more of it?
pam_beesly You could start by concluding this meeting.
michael_scott All right. And she won't say, "I love you."
dwight_schrute Oh, no.
andy_bernard How many dates have you been on?
michael_scott Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
andy_bernard Mm.
oscar_martinez That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
ryan_howard Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
ryan_howard Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before s*x? Does she shower after s*x? Does she...
michael_scott Yeah, she does all that.
ryan_howard Sorry, dude.
michael_scott No, no...
pam_beesly Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
michael_scott Run what?
pam_beesly Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
michael_scott Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
pam_beesly Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
michael_scott Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
jim_halpert You do?
michael_scott Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
jim_halpert But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
michael_scott That's what makes it so wrong.
michael_scott Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
dwight_schrute Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
michael_scott I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
dwight_schrute I think I've got one for you.
michael_scott This is you. How much do you charge?
dwight_schrute $100 a day, plus expenses.
michael_scott I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
dwight_schrute I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute And you might not like how I find it.
andy_bernard Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
stanley_hudson My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
andy_bernard Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
gabe_lewis There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
andy_bernard Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
gabe_lewis That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
andy_bernard What are we gonna do about this?
gabe_lewis I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
andy_bernard Let me know what they say.
darryl_philbin Wow. That dude is good.
andy_bernard What do you mean?
darryl_philbin You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
andy_bernard I don't know.
darryl_philbin Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
darryl_philbin Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."
dwight_schrute Hi stranger.
donna Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
dwight_schrute I work with Michael.
donna Right.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute.
donna Donna, hi.
dwight_schrute All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
jim_halpert That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
michael_scott It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
pam_beesly Oh!...
jim_halpert Oh, my God
michael_scott It's comfort food, all right? God.
jim_halpert You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
michael_scott I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
pam_beesly Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
michael_scott Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
jim_halpert Michael, no...
pam_beesly No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
michael_scott It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
pam_beesly Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
michael_scott God, this is so disgusting.
pam_beesly Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
michael_scott I know.
pam_beesly And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
michael_scott That's not true. You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
pam_beesly Helene.
michael_scott Helene?
pam_beesly My mother.
michael_scott Oh.
pam_beesly My mother, Helene.
michael_scott Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
jim_halpert You should stop this, and you should call Dwight right now.
michael_scott All right.
dwight_schrute Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
donna Thank you.
dwight_schrute It's all yours. Ah!
donna You okay?
dwight_schrute Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
donna Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
dwight_schrute Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
dwight_schrute Oh. Oh. Oh. One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
donna Nope. I'm good, thanks.
dwight_schrute Really? Hey, um...
Old#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode24 lady Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?
dwight_schrute Get out of my way. Huh!
dwight_schrute Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
donna I'm out of here.
dwight_schrute Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
donna You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
dwight_schrute Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh!
michael_scott You're back. What happened?
dwight_schrute Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
michael_scott No, what happened with Donna?
dwight_schrute Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.
michael_scott Ugh!
dwight_schrute Put your fingers here.
michael_scott No. No! Are you sure?
dwight_schrute I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
michael_scott Who eats eight protein bars?
dwight_schrute People who don't trust egg whites.
michael_scott Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
dwight_schrute Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
michael_scott What? No, she didn't say that.
dwight_schrute You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, "What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him." And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
michael_scott I am not paying for that membership.
michael_scott Ohhh... mmm...
erin_hannon Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
michael_scott No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
erin_hannon Uh, no. Wait, yes.
michael_scott That's her?
erin_hannon Yeah.
michael_scott Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
donna How could you think I would cheat on you?
michael_scott I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
donna That's pathetic.
michael_scott Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
donna When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak.
michael_scott If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
donna I told you I like you.
michael_scott Well, you are boner-ific.
donna Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
michael_scott ...poop my pants.
donna Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
michael_scott Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
donna We're going.
michael_scott We are?
donna Yeah.
andy_bernard What's up? I got your e-mail.
darryl_philbin Close the door.
andy_bernard Okay.
darryl_philbin I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. Andy don't mess with me. I'll figure something out.
darryl_philbin Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
andy_bernard Such as?
darryl_philbin It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was "Andy," "Problem," "Eliminate," something. I don't know what it meant.
andy_bernard What? You don't know what it meant? How about "Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?"
darryl_philbin Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
andy_bernard Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
kelly_kapoor Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
donna Thank you.
kelly_kapoor Did Michael get them for you?
donna No, I bought them myself.
kelly_kapoor Where?
donna Steamtown Mall.
kelly_kapoor Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
donna You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
kelly_kapoor Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
donna Uh, Franklin Mills.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
pam_beesly Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
jim_halpert Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
pam_beesly No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
creed_bratton Psst...
andy_bernard Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
creed_bratton So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
pam_beesly So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. This photo was taken this morning. It's Cece. She's never gonna do anything wrong.
donna Isn't that something?
michael_scott Wow. That's exciting.
pam_beesly Hey, Michael.
michael_scott Hey.
pam_beesly I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
michael_scott Well it can wait. It can wait.
pam_beesly I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
michael_scott Jim is her husband.
donna Oh.
pam_beesly And...
michael_scott And they are having problems, so sh...
pam_beesly No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
michael_scott Good in bed.
pam_beesly Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my s*x life with Jim.
michael_scott Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
pam_beesly I need you to sign this! So bad!
michael_scott Okay, weirdo.
pam_beesly I love ... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely.
donna Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
pam_beesly You're gonna wanna look at the date on that. Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. Are you a golfer?
donna I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. Hey, you okay?
michael_scott Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
pam_beesly Absolutely.
darryl_philbin Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Glen#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode24 I know, it's just, I'm scared...
andy_bernard Your text said 911.
darryl_philbin Glen, could you excuse us?
darryl_philbin It's bad.
andy_bernard What's bad?
darryl_philbin It's real bad.
darryl_philbin Still no plan.
andy_bernard Oh, God.
darryl_philbin It's getting bigger.
andy_bernard I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
darryl_philbin I can videotape it.
andy_bernard Yeah.
darryl_philbin There it is.
andy_bernard There what is?
darryl_philbin What?
michael_scott Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
pam_beesly I don't know who he is.
michael_scott God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
pam_beesly You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
michael_scott I have to hear it from her.
pam_beesly You have to settle down first.
michael_scott I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
pam_beesly Okay. Okay. Yes.
michael_scott I need to have her say...
pam_beesly Yeah, but you have to calm...
michael_scott I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"
pam_beesly Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
michael_scott No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
pam_beesly Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
michael_scott Okay. Okay. Okay.
gabe_lewis I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. We've investigated. Every time it's been user error. They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts.
michael_scott You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
donna Yeah, we should.
michael_scott Wouldn't that be fun?
donna Yeah.
michael_scott How about Thursday?
donna Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
michael_scott I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
donna Oh, Friday doesn't work.
michael_scott Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
donna Shoot. I'm working.
michael_scott Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
donna Well, won't you be at the concert?
michael_scott Nope, that's Tuesday.
donna Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
michael_scott You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
donna How do you know?
michael_scott Pam told me.
pam_beesly Did she see me?
jim_halpert Nice effort.
andy_bernard We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress.
darryl_philbin You haven't even introduced yourself.
andy_bernard Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
darryl_philbin You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
andy_bernard Higher? Okay. Recently certain events have come to my attention...
darryl_philbin Higher.
andy_bernard Make it higher? Okay.
darryl_philbin Mm-hmm
andy_bernard I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
darryl_philbin One more, yeah.
andy_bernard May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... ah! It's working. It's... I knew it!
darryl_philbin This...
andy_bernard We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
darryl_philbin I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
michael_scott Who is he?
donna What, what do you mean?
michael_scott The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
donna It's you. I'm married.
michael_scott I'm the mistress?
dwight_schrute Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
Gym#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode24 Instructor Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this.
dwight_schrute You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
Gym#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode24 instructor Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill.
dwight_schrute No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Gym#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode24 instructor No, guys, no. We're just cooling down...
dwight_schrute If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
In#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode24 memory of Larry Einhorn.
