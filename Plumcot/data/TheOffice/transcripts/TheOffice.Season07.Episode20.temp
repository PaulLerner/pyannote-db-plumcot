michael 
deangelo Did that? Did that just happen?! We should. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious!
oscar michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
kevin Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart!
michael Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting deangelo Vickers!
deangelo 
michael Come on out!
deangelo Hello! How are you sir?
michael I am well, sir, how are you?
deangelo Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-
dwight Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
kelly I'll get that you guys. Don't. it's just. you know.
deangelo I'll help you.
kelly Oh, hi!
deangelo Hello!
kelly Have we met before?
deangelo No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.
kelly Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
deangelo 
kelly And that is what you call a meet cute.
michael And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's deangelo the whole time!
darryl Kind of embarassing.
angela Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
michael I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
deangelo Oh. That was. let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there!
michael Oh yeah. I know. that's what I was just saying. that's what.
deangelo 
andy That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I. D. yourself.
deangelo Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!
andy I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
michael This is jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
pam Well, it wasn't an affair.
michael Yes it was.
pam But, no, but we are a family.
jim We made that.
pam Cecelia.
deangelo Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.
pam Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four.
pam Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
jim Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
dwight Thanks for meeting me.
michael Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
dwight There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
michael You know me very well, Dwight.
dwight That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
michael Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
dwight I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
meredith That apple looks delic!
deangelo I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200.
stanley Deangelo, you're going to starve to death.
michael So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
darryl It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
darryl It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
darryl I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
deangelo Here's the great thing about the southwest; there's so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen.
kevin Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
angela Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
deangelo I did not.
angela Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
deangelo Sounds very interesting, thank you.
erin Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
deangelo Why do you use your name when you use the phone?
erin Oh, that's how pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
deangelo Try it without using your name.
erin Dunder Mifflin, this is. oh, I like it!
deangelo Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?
erin Oh, assist.
michael I sorta like the old way.
deangelo I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point.
michael I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
deangelo And it really isn't.
michael Is that good?
erin Yeah, ok, good.
deangelo Well, I'd like to change it, actually.
michael Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
erin What do you think?
deangelo I think a change would be nice.
michael You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
denagelo Change it.
erin . I'm so sorry. Sorry. . push;
deangelo Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can't even look at you.
andy Here we go. ok. what do African Americans call.
erin Deangelo, did you order a barber?
deangelo Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline.
darryl Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
andy I. don't know. Help me.
ryan That is so badass. So hardcore.
phyllis Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
deangelo I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
michael Shave me. This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
deangelo Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close.
michael And this is erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.
deangelo Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it?
michael It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
oscar You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
deangelo Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
michael Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do. god. we sorta do more of like powwows or-
deangelo Ok, then, powwows then, fine.
michael That's-
pam Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
jim Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
pam Da-das.
jim And what happens here is-
deangelo You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry.
jim We were. I think she was just trying to-
deangelo No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?
michael You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
oscar Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
michael Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
erin Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
michael Don't shave my lips.
deangelo What's up?
andy I don't mean to go into a rant here, but.
andy I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
andy . I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
deangelo Let's not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.
andy I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where-
deangelo Now that's funny! That's funny! You walk much?
andy Yeah, right, I mean-
deangelo Little click.
erin Deangelo, this box came for you.
deangelo Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.
stanley Need a hand?
deangelo Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley!
michael You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so. you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
ryan 
michael I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
darryl So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
deangelo Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.
kevin Interesting.
michael Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy. Darryl's
sister 
darryl Cool, cool. Alright, see you later. Darryl's
sister Hey, hey, hey!
darryl No, I'm good. Keep them.
deangelo Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?
andy Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here.
deangelo Drink some soap!
andy 
deangelo 
andy I guess this is my life now.
dwight How do I become a manger at Sabre?
gabe First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
dwight I left a message at corporate.
gabe Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
dwight Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
gabe What recommendation?
dwight From when he recommended me to replace him.
gabe . I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
deangelo Best whale
watching easily the west coast. If you're going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called "West Coast Whales'. Because you're not gonna see them-
michael Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
kevin Awesome!
phyllis Mmm, whatcha got?
michael PB and J, my mom's recipe!
angela Michael! deangelo has a peanut allergy.
deangelo I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.
stanley What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
michael I think kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!
oscar Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if deangelo touches a peanut?
michael What?
deangelo Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O. J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.
jim Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
deangelo No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.
michael Oscar, here you go.
deangelo You're getting nut particles all in the air!
michael No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
deangelo Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.
michael No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. No body go in there. Stay where you are.
oscar Michael, This is insane.
michael No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
jim Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
michael Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
dwight Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
deangelo Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or. ?
michael I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
deangelo Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. Bring it in, come on. Ok.
michael Ok. Why did you have to be so damn good?
deangelo I. I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you.
michael No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
deangelo Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You've worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It's Lake Havasu time!
micahel Guess I've been working so hard I forgot what it's like to be hardly working.
deangelo Ok. What is the Native American girl's name?
michael You'll figure it out.
jim Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
deangelo That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.
jim Thank you very much.
pam See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
jim We're back in! Right?
deangelo I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled 'Babys I Don't Care About. '
