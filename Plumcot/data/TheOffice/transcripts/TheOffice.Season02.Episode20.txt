dwight_schrute Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
jim_halpert You look cute today, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Thanks, girl.
jim_halpert So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs.
dwight_schrute Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
kevin_malone Hey...
dwight_schrute I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
jim_halpert I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
pam_beesly Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can.
kelly_kapoor And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
dwight_schrute Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?
kelly_kapoor Six.
dwight_schrute I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
ryan_howard I go to a lot of parties.
dwight_schrute Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys.
ryan_howard I am not giving you my keys.
dwight_schrute Don't make me do this the hard way.
ryan_howard What's the hard way?
dwight_schrute I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
ryan_howard Yeah, let's do it that way.
michael_scott Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
dwight_schrute I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
jim_halpert Whoa. You are a volunteer.
dwight_schrute I volunteered for this job.
jim_halpert And that's not the same.
dwight_schrute It is my duty...
jim_halpert Volunteer duty.
dwight_schrute ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
michael_scott Narc!
kevin_malone
dwight_schrute If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
michael_scott I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
dwight_schrute Well, you have...
michael_scott Uuf, well...
dwight_schrute ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
michael_scott Okay...
dwight_schrute ...and I am very proud of being a narc.
michael_scott Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! Dude, where's my office? I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
jim_halpert Well, your office is behind you.
michael_scott Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
ryan_howard I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
dwight_schrute Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
dwight_schrute Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
oscar_martinez No, I have not.
dwight_schrute Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
oscar_martinez What are you implying?
dwight_schrute Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
oscar_martinez Okay. I'm done with this.
dwight_schrute He sure left in a hurry.
dwight_schrute I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
dwight_schrute Do you know what this is?
phyllis_vance Yes, it's marijuana.
dwight_schrute How do you know that?
phyllis_vance It's labeled.
dwight_schrute Dammit.
creed_bratton That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
dwight_schrute No, it's marijuana.
jim_halpert I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
dwight_schrute That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
jim_halpert Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
dwight_schrute I would remember.
jim_halpert Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
dwight_schrute That's not how it works.
jim_halpert Now how do you know how it works?
dwight_schrute Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
jim_halpert No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
dwight_schrute
oscar_martinez So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
jim_halpert Oh, um... Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?
stanley_hudson Is that supposed to be me?
jim_halpert Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
stanley_hudson I do not think that is funny.
pam_beesly He does everyone in the office.
stanley_hudson Hmmmpt.
jim_halpert@pam_beesly I do not think that is funny.
pam_beesly Jinx! Buy me a coke.
jim_halpert Oh...
pam_beesly No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.
pam_beesly Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
jim_halpert C'mon!
pam_beesly Sorry, that's not my problem.
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
angela_martin I understand.
dwight_schrute Where were you yesterday after work?
angela_martin
michael_scott Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?
kevin_malone That is so good, Michael
michael_scott Remember the narc bit? Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
dwight_schrute Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
michael_scott Waa... what? What are you talking about?
dwight_schrute Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
oscar_martinez Is that true, Toby?
toby_flenderson Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
michael_scott Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
michael_scott Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
dwight_schrute No you can't do that.
michael_scott I can do that, it is my office.
dwight_schrute No you cannot. It has to be official, and it has to be urine.
michael_scott Hmmm. Ha. Alright. Great.
dwight_schrute Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
kevin_malone I'm not taking Rogaine.
dwight_schrute Angela, what about you?
angela_martin I don't take any prescription drugs.
dwight_schrute You're not on anything?
angela_martin
dwight_schrute Good.
kelly_kapoor So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. I mean not everything, Jim. I promise, I'm not that kind of...
pam_beesly Hey guys, what's going on?
kelly_kapoor We're having the best conversation.
pam_beesly Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation.
kelly_kapoor So, I was looking so hot...
michael_scott It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
phyllis_vance We don't feel that way.
angela_martin No, not at all.
oscar_martinez You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
michael_scott No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."
dwight_schrute Thank you, Michael.
michael_scott I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
michael_scott Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
stanley_hudson Where did you get these facts?
michael_scott Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
stanley_hudson They are not.
michael_scott Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
stanley_hudson No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants.
michael_scott Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
toby_flenderson Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
michael_scott Yes it is.
toby_flenderson No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
michael_scott Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
toby_flenderson You can't do that.
michael_scott I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
toby_flenderson That's not random.
michael_scott Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.
pam_beesly I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
michael_scott Really?
pam_beesly Uh, hmmm.
michael_scott Jim it's okay. You can t... This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. Oh, he's doing it, okay. It's okay. Oh. Okay, are you sure? That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. Okay, well.
pam_beesly Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
michael_scott The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
dwight_schrute No, you will be tested.
michael_scott Yes, I will not be.
dwight_schrute You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
michael_scott Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
linda We test a lot of urine.
dwight_schrute Mine was green.
linda Oh, right. How are you?
dwight_schrute I'm all better.
michael_scott So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
dwight_schrute What kind of filing?
michael_scott Just forget it. Just the urine.
dwight_schrute That goes directly to the tester.
michael_scott Just. I need your urine.
dwight_schrute Like in a cup?
michael_scott Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
dwight_schrute For what purpose?
michael_scott It's none of your business.
dwight_schrute Then I refuse.
michael_scott Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
dwight_schrute Are you serious?
michael_scott I need clean urine for the lady.
dwight_schrute But that's illegal.
michael_scott Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
dwight_schrute Not my urine.
michael_scott A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
dwight_schrute Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
michael_scott No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
angela_martin Do you want to give Michael your urine?
dwight_schrute I want him to have all the urine he needs.
angela_martin You're not going to get my permission on this.
dwight_schrute I know that. Don't you think I know that?
linda Yeah, we do testing all over the country.
ryan_howard Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring?
linda You want to work at the urinalysis lab?
ryan_howard Yeah. Maybe.
dwight_schrute My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
pam_beesly What? Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything.
kevin_malone I'd like a magazine.
linda We just need urine, sir.
kevin_malone I'd still like one.
michael_scott Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
dwight_schrute That's great.
michael_scott What's wrong? Where's your costume?
dwight_schrute It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
michael_scott Why? Wha...
dwight_schrute I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
pam_beesly Here. Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight.
jim_halpert Hi.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert How much time do you have left on your break?
pam_beesly Ten minutes.
michael_scott Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
dwight_schrute Really?
michael_scott Yes, sir.
dwight_schrute That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
michael_scott So you wanna? Thanks.
hank Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.
michael_scott Okay.
hank Here's your badge.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. Can I have a gun?
hank No, I don't have a gun.
dwight_schrute Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
hank I don't think so.
michael_scott Good.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Michael.
michael_scott No. Oh. Uh...
dwight_schrute I need to go over some details with you.
michael_scott Alright. Well, Thank you.
dwight_schrute First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
hank Two.
dwight_schrute Oh, God.
jim_halpert Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
