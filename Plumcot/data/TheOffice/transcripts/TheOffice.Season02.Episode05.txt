michael_scott Happy Halloween, everyone! Oh... that's great!
pam_beesly Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.
michael_scott Ohh... OK.
michael_scott I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month. And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. Okay.
sherry_trickortreater Jan Levinson's office.
michael_scott Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
sherry_trickortreater Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.
michael_scott Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
sherry_trickortreater I just need the name of who you're planning to let go.
michael_scott I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
sherry_trickortreater I know she wanted the name.
michael_scott Okay... Sherri?
sherry_trickortreater Yeah?
michael_scott If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
sherry_trickortreater Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.
michael_scott Thanks.
sherry_trickortreater Mm-Hmm.
michael_scott I'll call her back. Wish I could fire Sherri.
sherry_trickortreater Hey, I'm still here.
michael_scott Okay! I'm sorry.
sherry_trickortreater Yeah.
michael_scott No?
sherry_trickortreater OK.
michael_scott Bye.
sherry_trickortreater Hanging up now.
michael_scott I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.
pam_beesly You wanted me?
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly Papier-mache?
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly Hmm.
michael_scott Yeeesh.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
michael_scott Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
pam_beesly Why did you put it off until Halloween?
michael_scott Because it's very scary stuff.
pam_beesly I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.
michael_scott You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
pam_beesly So it's a man?
michael_scott No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
pam_beesly I just answer the phone.
michael_scott And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
pam_beesly You're costume is fantastic!
michael_scott I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.
pam_beesly Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't. Aah! Okay...
michael_scott Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
dwight_schrute What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
jim_halpert I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
phyllis_vance That's great!
jim_halpert Oh, yeah.
dwight_schrute Yeah, well look... What about me?
phyllis_vance What are you? A monk?
dwight_schrute I am a Sith Lord. Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
phyllis_vance Ass.
michael_scott Hey.
oscar_martinez Michael.
michael_scott You guys excited about the party?
angela_martin Yeah.
michael_scott It's gonna be fun.
kevin_malone Yeah.
angela_martin Yes.
michael_scott Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
oscar_martinez What are you implying?
michael_scott All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
angela_martin You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.
michael_scott Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?
angela_martin Yeah.
michael_scott Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
angela_martin But we don't keep two sets of books.
michael_scott Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
michael_scott Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.
kelly_kapoor Why is that?
michael_scott "Bend It Like Beckham."
kelly_kapoor Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?
michael_scott Yeah. That would be perfect.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.
michael_scott Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
dwight_schrute Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH!
pam_beesly Okay, greatest strength.
jim_halpert Okay, okay...
pam_beesly A dog-like obedience to authority
jim_halpert Nice.
pam_beesly But that doesn't sound good.
jim_halpert Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player?
jim_halpert Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.
pam_beesly He's a gun nut.
jim_halpert Um. He sticks to his guns.
angela_martin Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...
oscar_martinez Yes?
angela_martin ... that has three people...
oscar_martinez Yeah?
angela_martin ... doing the work that could be done by two.
oscar_martinez This is great. Oh.
kevin_malone Yeah. Oh.
michael_scott Who do you think it should be?
dwight_schrute Jim. Definitely.
michael_scott No, Jim brings in money.
dwight_schrute Phyllis.
michael_scott Eh.
dwight_schrute Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
michael_scott It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
dwight_schrute One of the warehouse guys.
michael_scott What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
dwight_schrute Who is he saying?
michael_scott You're right, I didn't even think of him.
dwight_schrute No, Michael.
michael_scott Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
dwight_schrute No, not me.
michael_scott Yeah... I could.
dwight_schrute Not Dwight.
michael_scott I'm not saying that's what he said.
dwight_schrute I know that's what he said.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute Tell him, not Dwight.
michael_scott That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
dwight_schrute Tell him to stop.
michael_scott Are you kidding?
dwight_schrute Quiet, you.
michael_scott I agree. He'd land on his feet.
dwight_schrute Make him be quiet.
angela_martin Those aren't chips and dip.
pam_beesly No, I made brownies.
angela_martin Uh!
pam_beesly ... What?
angela_martin I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.
pam_beesly I made brownies.
angela_martin And I made cookies. Same category.
pam_beesly I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.
pam_beesly Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh, yeah. Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.
jim_halpert Um... Whoa. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
dwight_schrute Stanley, could you come with me, please.
stanley_hudson No.
dwight_schrute As Assistant Regional Manager...
stanley_hudson To the.
dwight_schrute Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry.
stanley_hudson You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
michael_scott So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
dwight_schrute He wouldn't listen to me
michael_scott Ahh, come on.
dwight_schrute If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
michael_scott I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...
dwight_schrute Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
dwight_schrute Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
oscar_martinez Oh... hey.
ryan_howard Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...
oscar_martinez Oh.
dwight_schrute So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis...
pam_beesly Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.
pam_beesly Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.
jim_halpert Um... it's in Maryland.
pam_beesly Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.
jim_halpert Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.
pam_beesly Jim...
dwight_schrute This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
michael_scott Oh, God.
dwight_schrute I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
michael_scott Fantastic!
dwight_schrute And I turned it down.
michael_scott What?! That would've solved all my problems.
dwight_schrute Out of loyalty to this company...
michael_scott Oh, you idiot.
dwight_schrute ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
michael_scott If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
dwight_schrute But then you wouldn't have me here.
michael_scott Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
dwight_schrute It's in Maryland.
michael_scott You can call. Can you call 'em?
dwight_schrute I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
michael_scott Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
jim_halpert Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.
michael_scott Can I speak to you a minute?
jim_halpert Um... yes.
jim_halpert Michael, I really didn't mean to...
michael_scott Help. Me.
jim_halpert I'm sorry?
michael_scott I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
jim_halpert Oh, you want me to be you?
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
jim_halpert Oh, are you firing Creed?
michael_scott No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.
jim_halpert We should switch seats in order to...
michael_scott Yes, that's a good idea.
jim_halpert Alright. Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...
michael_scott Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
jim_halpert Wow.
michael_scott I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
jim_halpert That's an overreaction.
michael_scott Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
jim_halpert Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
michael_scott I... this is Creed.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott I'm improvising, so just try to keep up.
jim_halpert Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
michael_scott And I'm very angry, and I want...
jim_halpert Michael Scott here.
michael_scott I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
jim_halpert Toby? Mm hmm. I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...
michael_scott Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.
pam_beesly What happened?
jim_halpert It wasn't me.
pam_beesly Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...
jim_halpert Yeah, I know.
michael_scott Uh, hey... Creed?
creed_bratton Huh?
michael_scott Could I talk to you for a second?
michael_scott You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.
creed_bratton What are you telling me?
michael_scott I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
creed_bratton No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.
michael_scott No, you wanna leave.
creed_bratton No, I wanna stay here.
michael_scott Why... why are you making this so hard?
creed_bratton Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.
michael_scott I think you're right.
creed_bratton Can I go?
michael_scott No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.
creed_bratton Let's fight it.
michael_scott Hmm?
creed_bratton Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.
michael_scott What old days? What are you talking about?
creed_bratton Did you start the paperwork yet?
michael_scott It's right here on the desk, yeah.
creed_bratton You don't have to do this, Michael.
michael_scott I can't, I can't...
creed_bratton Undo it!
michael_scott I can't change anything. This is the way...
creed_bratton No, you have the power to undo it.
michael_scott I don't... okay, just listen.
creed_bratton Michael, undo it!
michael_scott Don't...
michael_scott Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?
michael_scott I have to fire someone today, okay?
creed_bratton Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.
michael_scott Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
creed_bratton No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.
michael_scott Don't...
creed_bratton Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.
michael_scott Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?
devon_white Creed's an idiot, you know that.
michael_scott Well, he...
devon_white No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.
michael_scott Well, maybe I did.
devon_white Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.
michael_scott Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.
devon_white That's why I'm being fired?
michael_scott No.
devon_white So you might not look like an idiot?
michael_scott No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
devon_white This is unbelievable!
michael_scott I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
michael_scott Devon, wait, please.
devon_white What!
michael_scott Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
devon_white Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp. If any of you wanna meet me for a drink, I'm going to be at Poor Richard's. And the rest of you can go to hell!
angela_martin What about the Halloween party?
pam_beesly Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.
jim_halpert Come on.
jim_halpert That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.
michael_scott I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.
