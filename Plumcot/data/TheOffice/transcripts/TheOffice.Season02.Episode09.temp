michael It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Oh my God. Ohhh. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here. Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here.
jim Are we in danger?
michael There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody.
kevin Michael, should I call the. What?
michael The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
michael Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected.
sadiq That just means you have to enter your password.
michael Oh.
sadiq What's your password, Michael?
michael Oh, umm.
sadiq Oh, it's 1-2-3.
michael Yes.
dwight Mi-
michael AH! Guh-oood.
dwight Sorry.
michael Please don't do that.
dwight Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?
michael I can't tell you.
dwight You have to tell me.
michael I don't have to tell you anything.
dwight Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
michael Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Brrr! That's strong!
dwight Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
michael I'm not going get a brain-
dwight Or get hit by a car-
michael Stop it.
dwight Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
michael Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go. away?
michael There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.
michael So how do you search?
sadiq By keyword phrase.
michael Try "profits". No! Try "michael Scott". "Michael" "boss" and "funny". Oh my God, wow! E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy. "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss michael is an ass and making me stay late. " Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers.
oscar Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers?
michael Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? I will destroy everything in my path-
oscar Actually, it's just-
michael Beep! Bop!
oscar Ok.
michael Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk. Oil can. Oil can.
oscar Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
michael Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
dwight So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?
michael You know what the problem is?
stanley I think I do.
michael The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
kevin I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.
dwight Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
angela I know.
dwight Good.
pam Hey. Something just happened. dwight just told angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
jim What?
pam I know!
jim Hmm.
pam Do you think that they're like-
jim No.
pam No, right, no, no.
jim 
pam Uhhh, ew, ew, ew. . Maybe?
pam It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo. If you guys see anything. ?
pam Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
dwight Nice.
pam One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?
dwight Does he have access to their medical records?
pam Ummmm.
dwight I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
michael Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be. . No.
pam Hey, Angela-
angela Hi.
pam How's it going?
angela It's ok.
pam Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
angela No. Are we supposed to?
pam No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
angela Hmm. Excuse me.
pam Oh.
michael There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
kevin That's pretty young.
pam Yeah.
kevin Are you gonna eat with us?
michael Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup.
jim Uh hum.
michael Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm. You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
pam The professors would go to the parties?
michael Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.
jim It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making dwight up. He is very real.
pam What? Ohhhh. Yes! Thank you!
dwight 
question on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
jim Oh, uh, no. Could-
dwight I was wondering-
jim Could, keep that down.
dwight Why?
jim Because not everybody knows about the party.
dwight Like who? Who doesn't know?
jim Umm, Michael.
dwight Why just Michael?
jim Because it's a surprise.
dwight Is it?
jim Uh hmm.
dwight Oh, that's perfect!
jim So, don't tell.
dwight I won't.
jim Ok.
jim So, dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
pam Really? That's great.
jim I know.
pam Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
jim Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or.
pam Oh, no, he can't make it.
jim Oh, ok, cool.
michael Hey there.
jim Hey.
michael Almost quittin' time.
jim Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
michael One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
jim Oh, um. . I can't.
michael You have plans.
jim Uh hmm, definitely.
michael I do, too. I do, too.

jim Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
dwight Jim! You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
mark Hey, you must be Dwight!
dwight You don't work with us.

jim Really?
pam Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
pam Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
kevin Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.

michael Funny
story the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt. " And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
