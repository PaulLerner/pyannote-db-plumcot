michael_scott It's 4 30 in the morning. Do you know where your kids are? If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do. They're gonna be in this van. With me. Who am I? Nothing to fear. I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
michael_scott Time to make the donuts. Come on. Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again. Come on. De-nied!
ryan_howard We've been making 5 00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now. Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
michael_scott Hello! Time to make the donuts! Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts! Hey Pam.
pam_beesly We got the van at a used car lot. We think it says "Alleluia Church of Scranton." in Korean. It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
pam_beesly You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
michael_scott Milk and sugar.
pam_beesly Oh, awesome. You're a life saver. Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
michael_scott That's what I said.
pam_beesly Do you drink this every day?
michael_scott Every morning.
michael_scott We're, uh, we're doing okay. A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun. Uh, yep. We have 20-- of those.
pam_beesly Oh, oh, excuse me! Sorry. Sorry, no. It's, uh, it's a paper company now. It's not for the church.
charles_miner Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?
jim_halpert Oh, they're my client.
charles_miner No, they were your client. They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
dwight_schrute Shame, Jim. I expected more.
charles_miner In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
stanley_hudson What are we supposed to do? They keep undercutting us on price.
charles_miner I don't want to hear excuses. I want to see improvements. This is unacceptable.
andy_bernard Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
charles_miner Why are you telling me this?
andy_bernard I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
charles_miner Is this something you really want to have said?
andy_bernard I don't want to have said that. But I think it's important that you know it.
charles_miner I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
dwight_schrute It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
charles_miner I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
angela_martin Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports. Waste not, want not.
charles_miner Uh, well said, Angela.
dwight_schrute Been there, done that.
michael_scott You know what we need? We need some couches in here.
ryan_howard Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
michael_scott Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
pam_beesly Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
michael_scott Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top.
pam_beesly Yeah, I know what a loft is.
ryan_howard Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
michael_scott Most do in the magazines.
ryan_howard Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
michael_scott We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft.
david_wallace Wallace Would you let Charles know that David is here, please? Jim, hey.
jim_halpert Hey, David.
dwight_schrute David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace. Charles and I were waiting for you.
charles_miner There he is. There he is. How was the trip up?
david_wallace A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
charles_miner Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad. Hasn't been that bad. These people are the salt of the earth down here. You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
david_wallace Hmmm.
charles_miner I feel like I should be thanking you.
david_wallace Uh.
jim_halpert
charles_miner The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
david_wallace You know, I just want to address everyone first.
charles_miner Oh yeah, take your time. Stanley, pay attention.
david_wallace Hi, everyone.
kelly_kapoor Hi.
david_wallace Hi. Uh, look it's no secret--
kevin_malone Hi.
david_wallace Hello. Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business. And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
charles_miner Right.
david_wallace Okay?
phyllis_vance Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
david_wallace I've been wondering that myself lately. We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured. Jim, can you come in with us please?
charles_miner Uh, Jim hold on. You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy. Okay?
david_wallace Hmm.
charles_miner Yeah, Jim--
david_wallace I find that extraordinarily surprising.
charles_miner He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
david_wallace We'll bring them both in.
charles_miner Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim.
dwight_schrute Come along, afterthought.
michael_scott How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--
michael_scott They are correct, sir.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy Then you can't afford to pay him anything.
michael_scott Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy Your prices are too low.
michael_scott Lowest in town.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?
pam_beesly Corporate greed?
ryan_howard Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself. Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct.
ryan_howard Yeah.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.
michael_scott Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
ryan_howard Explain what you think that is.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy Okay.
michael_scott Explain that.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care...
michael_scott Well, we don't--
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy ...business expansion--
michael_scott Whatever, yeah.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make.
michael_scott Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Financial#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode23 Guy They're actually putting you out of business.
michael_scott Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
ty_platt It's a program. There's no such thing--
michael_scott Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please.
ty_platt Crunch.
pam_beesly Did it help?
michael_scott Hi, Jerry. Michael Scott. Well, this is slightly embarrassing. Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday. Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
pam_beesly When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child. He didn't know any better. You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, "Drive, kid. I trust you."
jim_halpert Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
charles_miner God, no.
dwight_schrute Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak.
charles_miner I agree.
dwight_schrute I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.
jim_halpert Really? Does he do good work or--
dwight_schrute No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist.
david_wallace Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
dwight_schrute Five minutes exactly.
charles_miner Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you?
dwight_schrute Sure thing.
charles_miner Yeah.
jim_halpert Hey. I saw you called.
jim_halpert You're just out of business?
pam_beesly We have maybe a month. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. We'll be okay.
pam_beesly That's what Michael said.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay. Oh, that's my new "Dwight" ring.
pam_beesly I like it.
jim_halpert Good, right? Hello.
dwight_schrute Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way.
jim_halpert Oh, okay. Don't worry about it.
michael_scott Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
pam_beesly Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
michael_scott I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this.
pam_beesly You want to hear something sad?
michael_scott I would love that.
pam_beesly So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive. So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money. I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart. None of 'em called me back. Not even for an interview.
ryan_howard I never went to Thailand.
pam_beesly Really?
ryan_howard I went to Fort Lauderdale.
michael_scott Was it nice?
ryan_howard Yeah, it was amazing. There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
michael_scott I love Pad Thai.
ryan_howard You've never had Pad Thai.
michael_scott No. There's a lot I haven't done.
jim_halpert Now, this is the projection over three months?
charles_miner We still have the inventory sitting--
dwight_schrute Let me float something out there, okay? Can I just say-- can I say something?
david_wallace Yeah, yeah.
dwight_schrute There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
david_wallace I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
charles_miner Yes. Yes, I was gonna say the same thing. We should buy him out.
jim_halpert Oh, but you didn't.
dwight_schrute Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure.
charles_miner What is wrong with you?
david_wallace Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him. You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
jim_halpert Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
david_wallace Yeah.
jim_halpert I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
dwight_schrute You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this?
charles_miner No, Jim... I think you should go.
jim_halpert Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
michael_scott Hmm?
jim_halpert Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
michael_scott We're not hiring, Jim.
jim_halpert Actually here for something else.
michael_scott Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
jim_halpert You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for? Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
ryan_howard Oh, that's nice.
jim_halpert David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
pam_beesly Seriously? Are you being serious?
ryan_howard He's bluffing, Pam.
michael_scott Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
jim_halpert Oh!
michael_scott No-- We don't have--
jim_halpert Oh! See I'm here to learn as little information as possible. All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
michael_scott Uh... Yes.
pam_beesly Yes.
ryan_howard Maybe.
jim_halpert Three yeses. I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
michael_scott Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
jim_halpert Missed the last part.
michael_scott That's a pun.
jim_halpert Got it.
michael_scott Yep. Oh... wow.
ryan_howard Okay, so you are not going to reveal in any way that we're broke.
michael_scott Of course not.
ryan_howard That we're having any problem at all.
michael_scott Nope, nope, nope.
pam_beesly Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
michael_scott Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
michael_scott Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
pam_beesly No, Michael.
michael_scott Ah...
ryan_howard No, man. You're-- you're fine.
pam_beesly We have to come from a position of strength.
michael_scott I'm good, I'm good.
ryan_howard Just put it out of your mind.
michael_scott It is. I'm good.
michael_scott Hello.
erin_hannon Hi.
michael_scott Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected. Well, well, well. How the turntables...
david_wallace Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
michael_scott And we are prepared to reject that offer.
ryan_howard Michael, you haven't even heard--
michael_scott Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?
david_wallace $12,000.
michael_scott Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
angela_martin What do you hear?
kelly_kapoor
david_wallace Here's the situation. Your company is four weeks old. I know this business. I know what suppliers are charging. I know you can't be making very much money. I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way. I'm sure you're scared. Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
michael_scott I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.
david_wallace Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000. Hmm? $60,0000. Michael?
michael_scott We'll have to talk--
charles_miner What?
ryan_howard We'll have to talk about this.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
michael_scott Just amongst ourselves.
david_wallace Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside. Take your time.
michael_scott Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
pam_beesly $60,000.
michael_scott We are so rich.
pam_beesly Are you kidding me?
dwight_schrute Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold. Charles.
charles_miner Dwight.
dwight_schrute May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
charles_miner What? How'd you hear that?
dwight_schrute They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures.
jim_halpert Great work Dwight.
dwight_schrute Quiet you.
jim_halpert No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
dwight_schrute You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
charles_miner So how long can they stay viable?
jim_halpert What are your top five cases?
dwight_schrute I'm gonna answer Charles first.
jim_halpert Because you've solved zero cases.
dwight_schrute Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed.
charles_miner Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room.
dwight_schrute Done.
charles_miner Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. Got it?
dwight_schrute I'm not-- I'm not following you.
charles_miner You two are morons.
jim_halpert Got it.
dwight_schrute Wh--
charles_miner Get out.
david_wallace So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer. We can finally put this whole thing behind us? Hmm?
michael_scott No.
pam_beesly Can you give us another minute please?
david_wallace Yeah.
charles_miner Oh, okay.
pam_beesly Michael.
ryan_howard How could you do this to me, Michael? You just cost me $60,000.
pam_beesly Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
michael_scott It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
ryan_howard I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
pam_beesly No, Michael's right. Jobs are safer.
michael_scott Agreed?
pam_beesly Agreed. But that's all, okay.
ryan_howard Yeah, discuss these things--
michael_scott Shut up, shut up. Hello?
michael_scott I want my old job back. I want my old parking space back. I want a Sebring.
charles_miner They don't make them anymore.
michael_scott And I want Charles gone.
david_wallace I am not firing Charles. He is very valuable.
charles_miner That's very kind of you to say, David.
michael_scott I need him gone.
david_wallace No.
michael_scott Okay, then I want Pam back.
david_wallace Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
michael_scott Sales.
pam_beesly Thank you.
david_wallace Pam's not a salesperson.
michael_scott Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
pam_beesly That's right.
david_wallace Okay. Please continue.
michael_scott And Ryan.
david_wallace Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael. Ryan is--
michael_scott You know, David. I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
david_wallace Do you realize what you're asking for here? You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
michael_scott And dental this time.
david_wallace Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand. You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
michael_scott These are our demands.
david_wallace Your company cannot be worth that much.
michael_scott Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.
david_wallace Michael--
michael_scott That's one of 'em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court.
david_wallace Okay. Deal. Okay?
michael_scott Can we have the room please?
david_wallace Yeah.
ryan_howard Yes, yes, yes!
pam_beesly Alright!
michael_scott Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about!
michael_scott There are certain defining moments in a person's life. The day he is born. The day he grows hair. The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin. What have I learned from all of this? It is far too early to tell. I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it. I just want to enjoy it.
charles_miner Hey, guys--
michael_scott No, no. You're done.
