pam Well, I should go.
jim Alright. I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
pam No, don't. I'm mad at them.
jim Why, what happened?
pam Not one of them called to congratulate me on our engagement.
jim Ah. That. they might be off the hook for because I. didn't tell them.
pam What? Why not?
jim I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
pam Come on, it won't be that bad.
jim OK. You know what? Here we go. Uh, everybody? I just want to make an announcement. pam and I are engaged.
pam Hi everyone!
oscar I thought you were already engaged.
jim Nope.
angela That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy.
jim Thank you Angela.
kevin I got a gift for pam and Roy. Do I have to get another one?
jim Yes.
andy A little close to my engagement there Tuna, what's your game here?
jim To get married.
dwight She's not a virgin, you know.
pam Wow.
michael What's going on?
pam No, nothing. Nothing Michael! Just saying hi.
creed The tall guy got engaged.
michael To be married?
jim Yep.
pam Sorry.
holly Pencils down! Just kidding, take your time.
holly Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder.
dwight I got it, I got it. michael &amp;
holly Let's get ethical! Ethical! I wanna get ethical! Let's get into Ethics yeah! Let me hear that Dunder Mifflin talk! Your body talk. Let me hear your body talk.
michael WOO! Alright!
michael "Why are you helping her? You're not even dating. " She's my friend. and. ultimately my strategy is to merge this into a relationship. without her even knowing. Uh.
michael Ok, let's give it for Miss. holly Flaaaax!
holly Thanks Michael. Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired.
kevin Oh come on! He's right there. He was hired. Oh check it out, "Hired Guy. "
jim Nice.
ryan Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six? Anyone know Joanna on that show? In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So.
michael Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
holly Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning. It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would have selected totally agree.
phyllis I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree.
holly Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
michael Well, I think we can all totally agree that holly is totally fantastic.
holly Thank you. In fact, spending a half hour at the water cooler during work hours is a form of stealing.
kelly What?
holly Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters?
stanley This meeting.
andy Hey-oh!
dwight Yes.
michael Can't set 'em up like that.
kelly Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time? If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking. I'll do it. I don't care.
meredith I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse.
holly Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.
michael Can we have a moment? Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look. you look fantastic.
dight Michael.
michael Yeah.
dwight What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
michael Do some. do some work. People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
holly Well, I just have to get through the binder.
michael Do you. just. you're kind of losing them.
holly I am?
micheal Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out.
holly Ok. michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That's not right.
michael Lauren, enough with the pencils.
holly No, I have to go over pencils and office supplies. It's part of the ethics thing.
oscar That isn't ethics. Ethics is a real discussion of the competing conceptions of the good. This is just the corporate anti-shoplifting rules.
andy I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? . Boom!
oscar Exactly, Andy.
andy Yeah, I took intro to philosophy, twice. No big deal.
dwight It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
andy No that's. not how it works.
michael I would not. steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.
holly Ok, but we should get back to business. Have any of you ever faced any ethical dilemmas in the workplace.
michael Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on.
oscar Pass.
michael I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
holly What was the dilemma?
michael To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
holly Oh--- no no no.
michael Yeah, . Come on, anybody. Let it fly.
oscar Ok, once in a while I'll take a long lunch.
michael A siesta!
dwight Time thief. Time thief! Fire him!
jim Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
dwight Never!
michael You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?
kelly Sometimes I download pirated music onto my work computer.
michael Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else?
holly No--- I, I'd like to hear more about that.
michael Mmm.
angela I once reported oscar to the INS. Turns out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.
michael Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
meredith I'll go. Have you guys ever met Bruce Meyers, the Scranton rep for Hammermill?
michael Bruuuuuuuuuce.
meredith Well for the past six years I have been sleeping with him in exchange for discounts on our supplies and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.
jim Jackpot.
michael Ach! Wuh---
holly Meredith, that is serious. I mean not only that a conflict of interests, there's also an exchange of goods.
meredith Exchange of steak. Have you ever had sirloin steak, honey?
michael That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got? You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right. what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is. unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work. Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate.
holly Michael, there is some serious issues with Meredith.
michael Oh.
holly I mean all of you have done things I wouldn't have done myself but Meredith's actions are really over the line.
micheal Nnyeah. What ya gonna do?
holly So, regarding this supplier, approximately how many liaisons have there been?
meredith Liaisons, you mean meet-ups? I don't know, once a month for six years. Something like that.
michael Meredith, why don't you tell Holly. it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened. and that you just like to sleep around.
meredith Am I in trouble here or something?
michael No. no, this is just a stupid formality.
holly No, it's not a formality. Now, were these, um, meet-ups just personal? Unrelated to business?
meredith Nah, I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the discount paper. There's not a lot of fruit in those looms.
micheal Ughh! For the love of God we're trying to help you. stupid bag.
holly What I don't understand is. why the steak coupons? I mean, if you were already getting the discounted paper?
meredith Well it's funny. Maybe it's a girl thing, but after we did it, and he would give me those coupons, I just felt good about myself. Hey what's going on here? I thought I had immunity?
holly Well unfortunately immunity or something being off the record does not really exist in the workplace. I mean I've never heard of anyone who's kept their job after something like this.
meredith Well. I'm not quitting. . push;
jim Yawn. Four seconds.
dwight What are you doing?
jim Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so. I'm just making sure.
dwight Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. Really? Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti---
jim Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.
dwight There is no way that that was---
jim One second.
michael Well, well. Holly. lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
holly It's Mike-raculous.
michael Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just. sit down and work this whole meredith thing out.
holly Sounds good.
michael Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
holly Oh I already bought this.
michael Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady. Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client. so. we'll just split it? Ethical.
holly So, I've gone over corporate policy.
michael What do you think? What do you think of this place?
holly Oh, it's very nice.
michael Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of. business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?
holly Mmm.
michael Wow, that sounds so. warm.
holly In Summer.
michael Here too. You know what my favorite season is?
holly Maybe we should talk about meredith first.
michael Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I. I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
holly Ok, so I have gone over this and I have thought about it and I just don't think there is any way I can write a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.
michael Wow, terminator, terminator.
holly I'm from da future.
michael Yeah.
jim Hey, Andy.
andy Yo.
jim By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
andy No, I did not. Was that any good?
jim Actually not. It was really so-so.
dwight Ok.
jim I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff. You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but. Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
andy Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?
jim You know, it's weird. It's practically a shot for shot remake.
andy Really? Huh, that's cool.
jim Story's kinda bland. It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
andy Really? That doesn't sound right.
michael I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance. I mean, what sort of place is that to call home? And meredith needs this job. This is her main source of money.
holly Well, that's very sweet but we have to follow the protocol. Those are the rules.
michael Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her.
holly We punish her?
michael Mmhmm, tell her she can't have s*x for six months.
holly I don't think we could enforce that.
michael I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
holly A chastity belt.
michael No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that. down. where you, where you put, where you put the.
jim He has not stopped working for a second. At 12
 45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible. At 1
 32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports. And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work. It's exhausting, being this vigilant. I'll probably have to go home early today.
michael I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.
holly No, you are saying that we should sweep it under the carpet, accept the discount on supplies, not fire meredith and pretend like the whole thing never happened.
michael Yes.
holly What am I saying?
michael Well. bleh busted. I don't.
holly I'm saying that her behavior is unethical and a little icky and I don't think I want to work in an environment where that sort of conduct is tolerated.
michael Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
holly It's not a family. It's a workplace.
michael I will be honest with you. That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault. The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her. And I am holding on to her leftovers.
jim 19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
dwight None of your business.
jim So I guess I can assume that was personal.
dwight Fine.
jim So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
dwight Yes, maybe I'm not.
holly It's been a little tense. People are suspicious of me. And my best friend in the office won't even talk to me. Turns out being the morality police does not make you popular. I should know because in middle school I was the hall monitor and the kids used to stuff egg salad in my locker. I was just hoping middle school was over.
ryan kendall from corporate HR is on line one and holly is on her way in too.
michael What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
ryan Two HR reps.
michael You get me.
holly Can I sit?
michael I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man.
kendall Listen, Holly, Michael, I just got the report that your branch submitted and there's a lot of stuff about a relationship meredith is having with.
holly Yes, that came out during the ethics seminar.
michael Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
kendall Well, I'm not sure these circumstances warrant any action.
holly Oh, I think it is pretty clear that it was unethical.
kendall Well, from what I can gather it seems like a gray area. Look, to be honest the company is getting a discount at a tough time in our balance sheet and I don't know that the right thing to do for the company is to turn our noses up at that.
holly Umm, Kendall, I understand that the discount is good for the company but I'm just not happy about the way we are getting it.
kendall I thought it was clear with you, Holly. Your task was to get signatures from the employees showing that they completed the training.
holly No, I understand.
kendall Every other branch has managed to get this to us so if it's not something you can handle then that's a different discussion.
holly No. I can do it.
kendall Good.
michael How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, "I told you so. " Gently with a rose? In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke? Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? . Probably the funny way.
holly Can I have everyone's attention? Excuse me, may I have everyone's attention, please. We need to finish the ethics seminar.
andy No way, lady.
kevin It's a trap.
holly Everyone, please, I just need your signatures to show corporate that I gave you the training.
meredith Don't sign anything.
michael Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
stanley It's a quarter to five and I have started to gather my things.
michael Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it!
meredith Am I getting fired?
michael Now is really not the time, Meredith.
holly In this next section we examine the difference between sick days and personal days. Sick days are only to be used when an illness precludes you form doing your job or can spread to your coworkers. Personal days, on the other hand, are much more flexible.
phyllis Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
meredith Hey, where is the steak sauce?
kevin I think we're out.
meredith I got some in my minivan somewhere.
andy Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?
kevin I think she got it as a tip, but I don't know why she didn't just take cash.
phyllis I don't care what she's doing. I just hope she keeps doing it.
stanley Amen. Just keep the ribs coming.
