receptionist Pam, line three.
pam Okay, thanks.
pam New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
pam Hey.
michael Paaam-o-laaaaaa.
pam Of course, now michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
pam Hey Michael.
michael Paaam-o-laaaaaa. Miss ya kiddo. Miss you. so much.
michael Hey.
holly Hello.
michael That was really fun last night.
holly Yeah, it was nice.
michael I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
holly Oh, that would be great. You need that.
michael Yeah?
holly Yeah.
michael Oh really?
holly Yeah.
michael Well.
holly It would help.
michael I, uh. I let her win.
holly No, he didn't.
michael So, when, um, can I see you again?
holly Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager?
michael No.
holly I don't care, free tonight.
michael Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. Because I am busy taking you out.
holly Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
michael Why?
holly I'm going out with you.
michael Wow. Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight.
holly No more.
michael Tonight's so.
holly No more.
michael Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
holly Thank you, you too.
michael You're welcome.
michael In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where. you have s*x. Does holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having s*x with me I'll know for sure.
andy That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
dwight You set a date?
andy J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? receptionist Money. K-Money.
phyllis What are you making?
dwight A knife.
phyllis You're making a knife with a knife?
dwight You got a better way?
phyllis You want to talk about it?
dwight About what?
phyllis You know I know. You know they know.
dwight I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
holly Oh, the mall could be fun.
michael Yeah.
holly We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
michael Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after. Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?
holly . Hell yeah.
michael Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then. then. then we can do. We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
holly Yeah, that's good.
michael Probably get soup or something light.
phyllis Hi.
dwight She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
phyllis It's nice to learn new things.
dwight I was talking to myself.
phyllis Okay.
dwight I just don't get it.
phyllis What don't you get?
dwight Why is she marrying Andy?
phyllis Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
dwight That's really fattening.
phyllis No, it's lettuce.
holly It's time to go.
michael No. No. Reservations are at 8
 00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
holly You're crazy, go crazy.
holly Oh, I forgot my keys.
michael Do you need 'em?
holly Yeah, lets go grab them.
michael all right.
holly Oh, after vous.
michael Thank vous. What? Oh!
holly I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
michael Not if we turn these dials all the way down. Now they can't hear us at all.
holly Oh, good.
michael We're totally alone.
angela Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10, 001 to 90, 000.
oscar Great, they stole my laptop.
kevin Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
oscar How does that even compare?
kevin Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
michael Oh, my God, what happened?
jim We were robbed last night.
dwight Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
holly Can I talk to you for a second?
michael Yeah. Oh. oh!
holly That wasn't us, right? I mean. you remembered to lock the doors?
michael No, did you?
holly michael I think this is our fault.
michael Oh, no, my God.
holly Oh.
michael Oh my God!
michael So much for s*x without consequences.
pam You are such a dork! Shots!
jim So apparently pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3
 00 in the morning.
pam I'm not drunk.
jim I'm on minute six of this message.
pam Okay, I do not sound like that. Man on
phone You can take the girl out of Philly.
pam Scranton.
jim The future mother of my children.
angela I never felt safe here.
andy You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
angela I would very much like that.
andy Yeah?
angela Yeah.
andy Consider yourself. at home!
dwight Ugh.
dwight Get in.
phyllis Where are we going?
dwight I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
phyllis Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
dwight Are you sure that's going to work?
phyllis It did when bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
dwight Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight.
holly How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
oscar I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
creed Nobody steals from creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? creed Bratton.
michael We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
michael To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
phyllis I think it's a fun idea.
michael Thank you.
phyllis We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
michael Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
phyllis Move on, Michael.
michael Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
oscar So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
michael I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be. a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
jim Do you need us for any of this?
michael Do I? . push;
holly michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
michael Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.
holly He knows how to get things. He got me.
michael Whoa!
holly Sorry.
michael Twice. . Right?
holly Mm-hmm.
michael Mm-hmm.
holly Mm-hmm.
dwight Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
angela I think you have me confused with another person.
dwight I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6
 14 PM. 6
 14!
angela I heard you.
michael Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. And welcome to C. R. I. M. E. -A. I. D. Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!
darryl Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
