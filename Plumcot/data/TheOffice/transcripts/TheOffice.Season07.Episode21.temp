michael It is six a. m. and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
deangelo Yes, and this happens every. ?
michael Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
deangelo Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.
michael Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
michael Alright let's go! This way, this way!
deangelo Thanks.
michael Surprise!
deangelo Congratulations!
jim Yep, okay.
michael You and pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
jim Okay.
michael Here we go! Have pam come down.
jim No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
pam What's going on?
jim Stay in bed!
michael Congratulations!
stanley Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
michael We got it.
deangelo Uh, leave it at the door or. ?
michael Yeah that's fine.
michael Hey Toby! You suck!
deangelo Is this an employee of ours?
michael Go go go go go go!
michael I've never seen this place in the daylight.
deangelo It reminds me of Katrina.
michael Here we go, alright got it? Set? Hello?
meredith I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
deangelo Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
meredith Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
michael Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
meredith No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. Let me fix you breakfast!
deangelo I'm not going in there.
michael Go.
michael Good morning Erin.
erin Oh hey, didn't see you.
michael You have big plans for tonight?
erin I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or. I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!!
michael You are getting so funny! Very good.
michael The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
michael Anything can happen at the Dundies! They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
dwight Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
michael Black tie optional.
dwight Every day is black tie optional!
michael A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
kevin Nice!
phyllis I love their breadsticks!
pam Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
ryan I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
pam Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
ryan I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
pam You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad.
michael Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
ryan Yeah that's great.
michael So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. And that person is DeAngelo!
dwight Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
deangelo Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
michael Think of it as part of your training.
deangelo Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay.
michael Okay, well we'll work on it.
deangelo Michael, I'm very, very bad.
michael You are doing it.
michael Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
kevin Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
michael Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
deangelo That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
michael Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys.
deangelo This did not happen.
michael Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. ryan come on up here. Tap deangelo out. Just watch this. Okay. ryan how are you today?
ryan Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
michael There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.
deangelo Uhhh, you sir! Are we having fun tonight?
jim Having a great time.
deangelo Oh good!
jim Thanks, yeah.
deangelo Where were you on September 11th?
michael No! God!
deangelo This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance. I-I fall apart. Obviously.
andy Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
michael No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
jim Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
michael Jim, please no loopholes.
darryl Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
michael This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
deangelo Me mo. Me mo.
michael Good. Good. Good!
deangelo Meee Mo, Mee!
michael Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
deangelo When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
michael Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. Let's try this. Put these on. I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, and make it sound perfect.
deangelo THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!
michael Say it with an accent!
deangelo THE DUNDIES!
michael The Dundies!
deangelo THE DUNDIES!
jim I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
pam Yeah. Hey, Erin, everything okay?
erin Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
jim Who's gonna see us?
erin Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
jim Get in the car?
erin Please! Sorry. Get in. Sorry sorry sorry.
pam What's wrong?
erin I eat lunch in the car now. It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
pam Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
erin I, really don't like spending time with him.
pam Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
jim I think I'm gonna go.
pam What?
jim I think you got this. Kay? Alright. Feel better!
erin Thank you Jim.
jim I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
erin I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
pam Wait, when am I. ? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him.
dwight 
kevin Hi!
dwight Appalling. Eye sore. Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
erin DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
deangelo Hello? "Jo"
 DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host!
deangelo Oh no! "Jo"
 Luckily I have someone for you!
deangelo Billy Crystal? "Jo"
 Better.
deangelo Neil Patrick Harris? "Jo"
 He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi!
deangelo Ughhh, I gotta find michael Scott! And then I gotta, Get Him to the Dundies!
deangelo Hey, can you help me find michael Scott Angela? "Angela"
 My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
audience 
deangelo Mmhmm.
angela Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
oscar 
oscar Try jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
deangelo Jim! Do you know where I can find michael Scott? "Jim"
 I totally don't know where michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
jim 
deangelo No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time! "Phyllis"
 Well, what are you talking about? Ohh! Ohh! I've fallen and I can't get up!
deangelo Maybe I just need to look into my heart. DeAngelo, where is michael Scott.
michael I'm here. In a good way! I've been here the whole time. . push;
oscar The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
dwight Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, michael Gary Scott. Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, deangelo Jeremitrius Vickers! Was that part of the. ?
michael DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
deangelo Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.
michael No, ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
deangelo This was not, part of the job description!
michael Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
deangelo Who am I doing this for?
michael You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu,
wondering Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to
say It's showtime. Get out there.
deangelo I can't.
michael Say it.
deangelo Stop, hitting me.
michael You can do it, just say it.
deangelo Hit me again.
michael Now hit me. One, two, three.
together It's showtime.
michael Alright, here we go.
michael Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line.
deangelo Fall asleep right after s*x. Huh guys?
jim Nope, go back to the script.
michael There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!
jim Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
michael Well done.
jim I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
michael Alright.
pam You didn't think to mention me huh?
jim Didn't I?
michael Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. meredith Palmer!
meredith Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
dwight Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
jim I gotta go do this.
pam Why?
dwight Big smiles folks! There they are.
michael Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, Danny Cordray! Danny couldn't be here tonight.
ryan How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
michael stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. But did you know, that stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to stanley Hudson! Come on up here you sick b*st*rd.
phyllis I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
deangelo They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. No, I hate this, I hate it so much. dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant manager Dundie. Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. This is for you trashcan!
manager Who gave you those crayons?
kevin I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
manager This is a cloth tablecloth! You can't color on it!
kevin Oh really? [camera shows that kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
michael You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award!
meredith That is bull!
erin Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
gabe What?
erin I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? Thank you for hearing me.
gabe Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. Alright I'm gonna go.
michael There you go.
darryl Damn that was cold.
michael It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to deangelo Vickers.
audience Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
deangelo Hold on, hold on one second. I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!
manager Okay, okay.
deangelo THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING.
michael deangelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
deangelo This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!
michael Okay, we're done! That's it.
deangelo Michael, are we?!
michael We're done. We're done!
michael So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well.
pam Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
michael What?
deangelo I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
michael No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
pam Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started.
michael So what you're saying is you kinda like it? I've fallen and I can't get up! That phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
jim I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
michael That got a big laugh.
jim That did. Pretty huge laugh.
michael You were laughing right?
stanley I was.
deangelo You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
michael We're really close.
deangelo I can just run over to the gas station.
dwight We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
michael That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
deangelo Okay, fine I'll hold it.
michael You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
dwight I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
michael Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
dwight Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
deangelo Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
michael What is your problem?!
dwight I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
michael Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
dwight And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
deangelo Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here.
michael He is in an all-out sprint.
michael Here. Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, andy Bernard!
andy A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
michael Oh, okay.
andy I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
darryl 
michael Oh my God, something's happening.
andy Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
all Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's how many minutes, that you've worked here.
pam In costumes!
jim And impressions!
toby In meetings. erin and
kelly And cups of coffee.
kevin For birthdays!
stanley More meetings and-
women E-Mail forms you made us read.
all Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!
meredith You hit me with your car!
ryan You helped me get off drugs!
creed I watch you when you sleep.
oscar I forgive you for kissing me!
all Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. kelly and
erin Call, text or e-mail, or call.
deangelo Measure your life in love!
all Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.
michael Yeah, okay. Well this is gonna hurt like a mother.
deangelo Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!
michael No it's not.
oscar It's his last Dundies.
jim You gotta play along man.
oscar Come on Toby.
michael Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!
toby I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more.
 Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
