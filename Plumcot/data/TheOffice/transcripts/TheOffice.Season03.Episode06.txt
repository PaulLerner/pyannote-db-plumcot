kelly_kapoor Here you go.
michael_scott Nice dress, Ryan.
kelly_kapoor It's not a dress. It's a kurta.
michael_scott OK.
michael_scott Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.
kelly_kapoor You look so handsome.
pam_beesly Really you do. I love the material.
kelly_kapoor I know.
michael_scott How come you didn't get me one?
kelly_kapoor I...
phyllis_vance Ok, so, between Meredith's Mini-van and if I borrow Bob's Yukon that should fit about twelve people.
pam_beesly I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.
meredith_palmer Do you want to make Appletini's and watch 's*x and the City' at my place?
pam_beesly Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
kelly_kapoor I don't get why you won't go. Did I do something wrong? I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
pam_beesly I just feel kind of tired, you know.
dwight_schrute Maybe you've got mono.
pam_beesly Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
kelly_kapoor Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
dwight_schrute Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
kevin_malone Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
roy_anderson I don't know. Who's... uh, who's going?
kevin_malone Oooh. Do you mean like, is Pam going?
angela_martin Don't go. They eat monkey brains.
michael_scott Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
michael_scott It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
stanley_hudson I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
michael_scott Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
michael_scott I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.
michael_scott Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.
kelly_kapoor Um... Diwali is awesome... and there's food... and there's going to be dancing... and... Oh! I got the raddest outfit. It has, um...
michael_scott Kelly?
kelly_kapoor Sparkles...
michael_scott Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
kelly_kapoor Oh, um... I don't know. It's really old, I think.
angela_martin How many gods do you have?
kelly_kapoor Like hundreds, I think. Maybe more than that.
angela_martin And that blue busty gal? What's her story?
kevin_malone She looks like Pam from the neck down.
dwight_schrute Pam wishes. Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
michael_scott All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.
jim_halpert Sorry.
jim_halpert I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
karen_filippelli Nice basket.
jim_halpert Thank you.
michael_scott Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '
dwight_schrute I see dead people.
michael_scott Okay. Spoiler... alert.
dwight_schrute He was dead the whole time.
michael_scott Just stop it. What's the... oh, whoa! Where did that come from?
tony_gardner Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again. I need your skinny, little arms.
karen_filippelli Oh. Did you shake it?
tony_gardner Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.
andy_bernard We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.
jim_halpert 'Scuse me?
andy_bernard Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.
jim_halpert Wow.
andy_bernard From 'Cheers'.
jim_halpert Yup.
michael_scott And another thing about the Indian people... they love s*x positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?
creed_bratton I have. That's the 'Union of the Monkey'.
meredith_palmer Oh, that's what they call it.
kevin_malone This is the best meeting we've ever had.
michael_scott Thank you, Kevin.
angela_martin I find this incredibly offensive.
michael_scott Well, I find it beautiful.
angela_martin Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine but we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
michael_scott No...
toby_flenderson Actually, she's right. This isn't appropriate. Why don't I take these.
michael_scott No, You're not going to collect them.
toby_flenderson Yes.
michael_scott No. This is delightful, charming culture.
michael_scott My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just s*x. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.
josh_porter All right. Think you guys should be all set. Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
karen_filippelli Thanks.
josh_porter And Karen? Let's keep it to twenty dollars a person this time.
karen_filippelli Got it.
jim_halpert Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
andy_bernard You guys ready to party?
jim_halpert What's that?
andy_bernard I said are you ready TO PARTY!
phyllis_vance Isn't this fun? Not wearing shoes?
angela_martin I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
kevin_malone Stop it. It's a disease! I've told you.
carol_stills I thought you said this was a costume party!
michael_scott What does that look like to you?
carol_stills An Indian woman in a sari.
michael_scott No one's even going to notice.
kevin_malone Nice outfit.
michael_scott Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
michael_scott I'll have one of those as well. Thank you very much. Now these are limes, lemons, onions...
angela_martin I'm a vegetarian. What can I eat?
teenage_food_server It's all vegetarian.
angela_martin I'll just have some bread. You used your hands.
michael_scott Oh, yuck.
carol_stills What? Too spicy?
michael_scott No. These s'mores are disgusting.
carol_stills They're not s'mores. They're samosas.
michael_scott Do you think they have any s'mores?
michael_scott All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?
ryan_howard So, you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
Girls#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode06 Kelly Zach Braff
ryan_howard What?
kelly_kapoor Ruka, Nipa, Tiffany. Stop acting like such little losers and just be cool. Come on, Ryan. Come on. Leave him alone. I hate you guys.
ryan_howard They said something about Zach Braff.
kelly_kapoor Don't even listen to them. They're so...
ryan_howard No, you don't...
pam_beesly Very official.
pam_beesly I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
dwight_schrute Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
kelly_kapoor I don't even want to hear it. Okay. I didn't come this Diwali to get yelled at!
kellys_mom Stop it right now. Ryan is a temporary worker, makes no money. Wally is a whole doctor. So handsome.
kelly_kapoor Uh... excuse me. I want to get a...
kellys_mom He's a perfect match.
andy_bernard Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?
jim_halpert Yep.
andy_bernard One. Two. Three. Shot!
jim_halpert Oh, Holy Mother of God.
andy_bernard Oh, that burns! Golly. Um...
jim_halpert Good.
karen_filippelli Ooh.
Overhead#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode06 Looking so crazy, my baby. I'm not myself lately. I'm foolish. I don't do this. I've been playing myself. Baby I don't care. Cuz your love got the best of me. And baby you're making a fool of me.
michael_scott Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?
kellys_dad Yes.
michael_scott Wow.
kellys_dad How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
michael_scott Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!
kellys_mom She is very fair.
michael_scott She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
andy_bernard One. Two. Three. Shot!
jim_halpert Oh.
carol_stills Are you okay?
michael_scott I'm going to be. Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
all@ Awww!
carol_stills Oh, Michael.
michael_scott What do you say?
carol_stills Can we talk about this in private?
michael_scott I didn't hear you.
carol_stills Can we talk about this in private?
michael_scott Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
michael_scott No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...
carol_stills This is the ninth date, Michael.
michael_scott Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
carol_stills I better go. Okay, you can find a way home, all right?
michael_scott Yes.
carol_stills Okay.
michael_scott Ok. Okay. Good night. Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.
carol_stills Okay, good night, Michael.
michael_scott All right. Good night.
ryan_howard Well, I was a Temp but I got promoted. So, um... the compensation is a lot more competitive.
kellys_mom So you're saving money...
ryan_howard Yes.
kellys_mom ...to start a family and home.
ryan_howard Oh, um... or travel. And,um... and buy an Xbox.
kellys_dad Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight?
pam_beesly Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.
bollywood_dancer Man Is it? He's really outgoing, huh?
pam_beesly Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
pam_beesly It's hot in there. How's the naan?
angela_martin Dry. You look like you were having fun.
pam_beesly I am. You should come dance with us.
angela_martin I have to watch our shoes so they don't get stolen. Who were you texting?
pam_beesly No one.
andy_bernard I went to the doctor. I went to the mountains. I looked to the children...
karen_filippelli Andy, no acappella.
andy_bernard I looked to the children, I drank from the fountain.
andy_bernard and Jim There's more than one answer to these questions pointing me in a crooked line
andy_bernard Wait, wait.
andy_bernard and Jim the less I seek my source...
karen_filippelli Oh, come on, guys. Please.
andy_bernard and Jim the closer I am to fi-i-i-ne. The closer I am to..
karen_filippelli It's not good.
andy_bernard and Jim fi-i-i-ine!
andy_bernard TUNA! Are you kidding me!!
michael_scott Oh, God! Oh. Wow.
pam_beesly Here.
michael_scott That's so spicy.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott Oh. You waiting for a call?
pam_beesly Uh... no.
michael_scott Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
pam_beesly Well, you were never really engaged.
michael_scott I was in that marriage arena, though.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
pam_beesly I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
michael_scott We're so alike. So alike.
pam_beesly What are you doing?
michael_scott What are you doing?
pam_beesly I'm rejecting your...
michael_scott I'm... what? I didn't
pam_beesly ...kiss.
michael_scott Can I have a ride home?
pam_beesly If you sit in the back.
karen_filippelli Goodnight, guys.
jim_halpert Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
andy_bernard No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.
jim_halpert Okay.
jim_halpert Oh.
karen_filippelli Hey dummy, get in the car!
jim_halpert I'm a drunk driver.
karen_filippelli Yes, you are. Here. Let me take that. Just... uh... get in the car.
jim_halpert Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
karen_filippelli Yeah, you can't.
jim_halpert No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
karen_filippelli Sure. Here's your bag. Just don't puke on anything. You okay?
jim_halpert So good.
karen_filippelli Good.
michael_scott These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.
pam_beesly You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.
michael_scott Sorry.
michael_scott This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!
