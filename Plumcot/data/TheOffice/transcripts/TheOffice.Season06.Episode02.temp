michael Yeah?
oscar You wanted to see me?
michael Yes, oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
oscar Yeah sure.
michael I'm going in for a procedure today.
oscar Is everything okay?
michael Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared.
oscar I'm sure everything will be fine. What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
michael It is a colonoscopy.
oscar Okay.
michael In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
oscar Oh my God.
michael My main concern, should I have a safe word?
oscar Yeah. david
wallace So Michael, do you think you can give me a run down on the Buffalo clients by Monday?
michael Abso. you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
david Okay, I will look at it Monday.
michael Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.
david Okay, jim you wanna hit the conference room?
jim Sure.
pam Hey, Good luck.
michael Oh right, this thing. I remember now. What's this about?
jim Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
michael It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
david No, ah it's okay Michael. We got it.
michael Really?
david Yeah.
michael Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
david Okay.
michael Am I worried that jim and david are having a meeting without me? No, because we are the Three Amigos. And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off. to the bathroom. while the other two have a secret meeting.
michael Hey let me escort you to your desk.
pam Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.
michael You and jim are close, huh?
pam Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.
michael Hey, what do you think he and david are talking about? What do you.
pam Ummm, I don't know.
michael Well, you said good luck to jim as he walked in.
pam Did I? Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.
michael If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk.
pam Please don't talk about my breast milk.
michael I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?
pam Yeah.
michael I just don't want you to.
darryl I was rushing to fill an order. I put the ladder up to grab a box of three hole from the top shelf. Next thing I know, I'm on the ground and the ladder's on top of me.
toby And that's how you broke your ankle?
darryl Yes.
dwight Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
darryl This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
dwight Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
darryl If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
dwight Nnnnn, that's not. okay.
darryl Be quiet.
dwight I'm talking about. hmmm.
toby I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better.
darryl Thanks T-Man, later. [fist bumps Toby}
dwight So long Darryl, feel better. He's lying.
toby He has a doctor's note.
dwight Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders.
toby A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news.
dwight Since when have you known darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? Y'all having birthday cake?
toby That's not a very good Darryl.
dwight Please. and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
toby Hmmm.
dwight It just doesn't add up.
toby Well, we did a little investigation and dwight had a good point. The ladder didn't reach the top shelf. I don't know if I believe it, but I am a fan of the hardboiled detective novel. I'll punch you in da mush, see.
michael Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired. Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now. I will. I love you too. Bye.
jim Who was that?
michael Sorry about that. What'd I miss?
david Michael, we would like to continue the rest of this meeting in private, please, if you don't mind.
michael Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this. call waiting. Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
creed They've been in there a while.
michael Yeah.
creed Can't be good.
michael Nope.
creed Think they're talking about me?
michael No, I think they're talking about me.
creed Yeah, that makes way more sense. Okay thanks boss.
michael What is jim telling him? That I can't handle this job? That 's bull crap. That is bull crap. Although, it has been chaotic lately. Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients. I will tell you there has been work everyday. Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve. I left my cell phone here.
pam Hey Kelly.
kelly Ugh, so jealous of your boobs.
pam Thank you. Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.
kelly Is ryan going?
pam I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.
pam We invited everyone in the office to our wedding. Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls. Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls. Then michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday off, if they came. So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.
kelly Here's the deal. I really want to go but I'm not gonna go if ryan doesn't go, because it's kind of a waste of time. That came out wrong. It would awesome if you could try to get him to go because I'd really like to be there to support Jim.
andy What can I do for ya Hoss?
michael How are your sales doin'?
andy How are my sales doin'? Busted. My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy. You're not buying it, you're good. Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately. I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.
phyllis Again with the cousin.
andy Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay. "Hey andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha. "
michael Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?
michael wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.
michael You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work? Well, I don't believe that. I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart. It is just elegant.
michael Be my eyes.
andy You got it.
stanley What have we here?
andy Oh, just backing up and turning around.
kevin Hey, we're gonna do this.
andy Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. Pardon moi, Messieurs. I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.
david Cheese platter?
andy Oui, Oui, Monsieur. From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar. Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan. Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll find both challenging and delicious. At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing. If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese. Bon appetit.
david Alright, well I should go. Thanks for this. You've given me a lot to think about. Please promise me you won't do anything until we speak.
jim No, I won't. Alright, thanks for giving me your time, I appreciate it.
david Thank you Jim.
david Erin, is michael around?
erin I think he's around here.
michael Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'?
david Ah, yeah, could we talk in your office for a second?
michael Yes, definitely.
toby Sounds like a EMDP-40.
dwight Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
toby You're into trains?
dwight I have been my whole life.
toby Wow.
dwight I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
toby That's so cool.
dwight Yeah.
toby Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
dwight Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
toby Well, you know, 'cause of the trains.
dwight Wa. wa. wait , someone's coming.
toby Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.
dwight Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera!
toby Get over there! Get over there!
dwight Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
toby I can't believe this. Hey you, ass****!
dwight Toby.
toby You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
dwight Ooohhh. Oh man! You okay?
toby Just keep going.
pam Hey Ryan.
ryan Hey.
pam So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.
ryan Yeah, I might stop by.
pam It costs about $75 per person.
ryan Okay, I once had a glass of Cognac that cost $77.
pam Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?
ryan Yes, I'm coming to your wedding.
pam Okay, ryan Howard, yes.
ryan Probably, yes.
pam kelly Kapoor, yes. . push;
david Are you sure you're okay with these new responsibilites?
michael Look who you're talking to.
david I'm just trying to figure out the best way to utilize everyone's talents.
michael Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
david What about Jim? Do you think jim is someone who is ready to move into a management position?
michael Permission to speak on the record?
david Please do.
michael jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I. If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
david I thought you liked Jim?
michael Very much, jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report. right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
david "Constant office distractions, spends way too much time at reception, antagonizes other salesman, not at all what he thinks he is. "
michael It's not very well written, but you get the gist.
david Is there anybody else you think could run the day to day of the branch?
michael I can just continue to run it myself.
david jim had an interesting idea to help you with this extra work load and it involved you being promoted to oversee all northeast sales and then jim would be promoted to your position.
michael This was Jim's idea?
david Mmhmm.
michael Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
david Ummm. okay, here's the thing though. The plan doesn't work unless we have someone to replace you. I was hoping. plus we have to worry about Jim, he has another job offer. We may have to replace him.
jim I didn't tell michael because I thought he'd try to help. Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.
david jim can you walk me out to my car for a second.
jim Sure.
michael I can't help but feel partially responsible.
michael Little pick me up? Oh those are the best. Little sugar rush.
jim When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?
michael Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
jim Why don't we head in your office to talk?
michael Oh what a week, God. We said. I know there were certain things we said.
jim Michael, look I'll just be honest with you. Earlier today I spoke with wallace about a promotion. I actually think that talk went really well. And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.
michael Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird. it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.
jim Michael, did you say anything?
michael Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
jim Really?
michael Yes!
jim You will? Wanna do it right now?
michael Yes.
jim I tried to keep michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
dwight I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated.
toby If they were dilated.
darryl Toby! Dwight! Is that them?
gwenneth Definitely.
darryl You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
dwight We thought that she was you.
darryl Why would you think a lady is me?
dwight Are you. are you serious? Be. cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?
toby No, nah. I don't see it.
darryl Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
dwight Aww, Darryl.
darryl C'mon Gwenneth.
gwenneth Sad.
david This is David.
michael Hey David, this is michael Scott. michael Scott here.
david Yep.
michael Just wanted to talk to you about jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
david So, what, you're changing your mind about Jim?
michael Absolutely, not. Like I said before, jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.
david Michael, it seems like you're cutting in and out. This is not what you said earlier.
michael Wha. here's the thing, jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
david Well, it doesn't change what you showed me in Jim's file.
michael Well, nnnn, that. that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
david Michael, I really don't know what's going on down there, but. oh, dammit, I am getting pulled over for talking on my cell, dammit.
toby Hey Darryl, look ahhh, we're here to apologize ahh.
darryl Cool.
dwight Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
toby What?
dwight He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
darryl Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
dwight Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby.
toby Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain.
darryl Alright, yeah fine so whatever.
dwight Yes!
toby You really did it.
dwight Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because darryl lied on an official form.
darryl And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
dwight Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that.
toby Ahhh, kay. Look, we could all file complaints against each other and just drown in a sea of paperwork, but you know, we can just move on with our. with our lives.
toby So dwight and darryl came to an agreement that both would file complaints with corporate and now I get to do all this paperwork. We worked it out.
michael Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face. Alright, Just do it.
jim How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
michael I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, and now I don't wanna lose the baby.
jim So instead, you screwed me?
michael That's what she.
jim No.
erin david wallace is calling.
michael Kind of in the middle of something here.
erin Should I tell him you'll call him back?
michael I, yeah. no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both.
michael Hello.
david Hey Michael, you got jim there with you?
michael No, it's just us.
david Actually, can you call jim in? I want him on, please.
michael Oh, oh, well here he is right now. Come in.
jim Hi David.
david Hey guys, so I spoke to Alan, we had kind of an unconventional idea, which I think is pretty cool. But it only works if everyone's on board.
michael Well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager.
david We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. jim would handle the day to day and michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff.
jim Wow, that sounds pretty cool.
michael I like that, so manager and co-manager.
david Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.
michael Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
david Alright, hey michael can you pick up for one second. Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do?
dwight Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed.
michael Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make. whoa do you have an announcement?
dwight I'm. I was making it.
michael Everybody, david wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote jim to the position of co-manager.
stanley Co-manager of what?
michael Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
phyllis What's happening to you Michael?
michael What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. jim Halpert, welcome.
jim Thank you.
dwight AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
meredith Niagara Falls in October? Pfft, hells yeah.
pam Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?
meredith Nah, I'll just tell you now, easier.
pam Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging.
meredith I'll just have whatever's fanciest, unless there's ribs. I'll just get the other information the day of, I'll text you.
pam You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.
meredith Uh huh.
pam To ask for directions.
meredith Right.
pam And you will eat whatever is fanciest?
meredith Unless there's ribs.
angela Rude.
pam So rude, right?
angela Mmm hmmm.
pam Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day. It's incredible.
angela Pam, my bag was there.
