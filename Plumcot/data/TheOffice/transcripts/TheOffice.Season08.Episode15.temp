dwight Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for ryan to do his morning ecstasy. We're already twenty minutes late.
dwight Wake up!
dwight Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
erin Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
dwight Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
erin Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day!
stanley Mmm! Ugh!
dwight Good morning.
erin Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
ryan Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. Oh, not cool!
jim I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-
dwight Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? Oh man.
erin What do you think happened?
dwight Looks like jim got mixed up with some bad apples. Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh.
jim Puppet.
cathy Cool, for your kids?
jim Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
dwight Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
dwight I need to make nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
dwight I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
saleswoman What does he like?
dwight Power.
ryan Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here. "
dwight Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
erin Hey, are you okay?
dwight I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
erin Who says none of us are diarrheal?
jim Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
dwight Very funny, Jim.
jim Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
dwight I'm gonna set your face on fire.
jim That's a good one. Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
stanley Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
jim Yes.
stanley You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
jim Loggins and Messina.
stanley Did I say "Messina?"
andy Ahh! Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
creed I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
andy It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin. I thought that would be cooler.
darryl I loved it.
meredith Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
andy Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
oscar Can we see that? Did you really find it?
andy Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. In the trash.
pam Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. erin set the phone to voicemail.
everyone Oh great.
kelly We're screwed.
pam There.
andy Oh! There we go! Pam?
pam Yeah?
andy Can you get the phone?
pam Well I'm not the receptionist.
andy Mm, well, you used to be.
pam I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
andy Phone's ringing.
kelly Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
everyone Somebody! Answer the phone.
kelly Andy, pick up the phone!
stanley Get the damn phone.
meredith You're the closest one to it.
andy Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
jim Man.
cathy How was the drive?
jim Fantastic. stanley drives so fast.
stanley Life is short. "Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse. " That's one of my mottoes.
jim I would love to hear the other mottos.
packer Quick query, Halpert.
jim No way.
packer Still queer?
dwight Packer.
packer You can't put me down. Too strong!
packer Yeah, dwight and jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
nellie Psst. Say, "So who's leading this thing, anyway?"
ryan So who's leading this thing, anyway?
nellie Psst. Say, "I can't wait to meet him. "
ryan I can't wait to meet him.
nellie Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
ryan I-
nellie You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping pen1s? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping pen1s is right here, and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my pen1s. I'm nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. After you decided I wasn't "a good fit-"
jim It was-
nellie Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, "Yes!" So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
cathy Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
nellie No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
cathy Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
nellie Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
erin Yeah!
nellie Let me just get the projector working.
dwight Uh.
jim You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
dwight You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
jim Okay.
dwight What is the antidote?
jim True love's kiss.
nellie Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
dwight I'll do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight. " Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head.
packer I can do it.
dwight Mmm! There we go.
dwight Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. What kind of poison did you use?
jim Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
dwight Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
nellie Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. Emergency
operator Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?
dwight Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
packer I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time.
nellie Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual.
packer Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
dwight You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
packer Did you say "masturbator?"
dwight I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
nellie Why are you sitting down like that?
dwight Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
jim Wow. Are you that bored?
stanley It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
jim Is that another motto?
stanley It's whatever you want.
jim Mmm.
stanley Or do you only drink with your kids?
jim Ah, let's do it. Oh, that's healthy. . push;
jim I've spent so much of my life telling myself "Please, don't end up like Stanley, " and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
nellie We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans. pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
packer Yup. Tallahassee, let's go.
erin Jim, are you in?
jim Oh, I don't know.
stanley Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
jim All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
packer This is great. This is gonna be great.
nellie I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.
dwight I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
ryan Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
dwight Ahh!
ryan Dwight?
jim Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
dwight everyone stop moving! everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
packer Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
dwight Stop moving!
jim No one's moving!
dwight Oh!
everyone Oh, oh!
dwight Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
jim Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
jim The one thing pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
paramedic You need an operation. You have appendicitis.
ryan Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
erin How long will he be gone?
paramedic Two or three days.
dwight Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
packer Drama queen, am I right?
dwight Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
packer That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
pam Whoa, are those mini pizzas?
andy Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
kevin Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
andy Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
darryl Oh yeah.
andy Up high.
darryl Yes sir. Thanks.
andy Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. I put out some new magazines, check it out.
creed Ah, Dwell.
andy I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. Oh, there's the phone!
dwight I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
erin Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
dwight Who's doing the presentations?
erin Packer's giving one. Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
dwight Damn it!
erin Let's see, what else have you missed? ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
packer -features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.
nellie Very good point.
dwight Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
nellie Dwight, are you all right?
dwight I'm great. How are you?
dwight What's our presentation about?
jim Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
dwight I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
erin Do a hundred jumping jacks.
dwight No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
erin I don't feel like it either!
erin Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
dwight I want that vice-presidency.
jim You haven't done any of the research.
dwight "You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name. " You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
stanley Aw, let him do it.
jim Stanley, are you listening to music?
stanley Yup.
dwight All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
nellie Ah, what is your topic?
dwight What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
erin Retail consumer habits.
dwight Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is. The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
dwight Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
ryan I can field this one.
dwight No, sit down. "Seasonal. " Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna. take a. brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God. Next slide.
andy Mail call! His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen. yogurt.
kevin Are those the lyrics?
dwight Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
nellie What are the three pillars of retail?
erin Convenience.
dwight Ingredients.
erin Service.
dwight Burgers.
erin Building loyalty.
dwight Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only
one desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
nellie Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
dwight Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
jim You are bleeding through your shirt.
dwight Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. Ah.
pam Hey, having fun?
andy Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
pam Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
andy I found my calling.
darryl Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
pam Guys, I don't like this analogy.
andy Ugh! Fine. Did you see this?
pam It's nice.
andy I mean.
nellie How are you feeling?
dwight Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
nellie Can I see the wound?
dwight Oh God.
nellie Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
dwight You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
nellie A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
dwight That's right.
nellie That is amazing. Todd, look at that.
packer Oh, yikes. Incoming-
dwight Ah! Not so fast.
nellie Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you have a lot to offer.
packer It would be an honor, ma'am.
dwight I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
dwight I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
andy Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew. Donna
muraski Hi Andrew. What happened to Erin?
andy Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks. Donna
muraski Oh, good for her. She's such a sweetheart. You tell her Donna muraski misses her.
andy I miss her too.
nellie Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous amos Cookies. Wally
amos Aloha, aloha, aloha. So I hear you're all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game. Well, back when I was regular Amos-
stanley What's under the cloth? Wally
amos We'll get to that.
packer Cookies. Bet you anything it's cookies. Wally
amos It's cookies. Let me- let me finish my speech first.
nellie Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies!
erin Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I- Wally
amos Is it oatmeal with no raisins?
erin I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
