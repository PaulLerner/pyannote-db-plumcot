pam michael we don't know what you're talking about.
michael Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
kevin michael you could put your initials in it.
michael M. G. S. ? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't.
jim Yeah that's true.
michael Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
phyllis We-- we--
michael Here we go!
phyllis Well--
michael Let's, yes?
phyllis When I was a little girl.

michael It's drying, it's drying.
phyllis In our neighborhood.
michael Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
phyllis What did we write?
michael Ahh come on!
andy Here it is, you should draw a picture.
michael No!
andy Cause that says, that says.
michael No!
andy So much more than words.
michael No!! Come on, gimme something good!
kelly Ok, ok, I was watching E!, and I saw Will Smith outside the Chinese Theater, and omhmygod, he looked so good.
michael Pam, translate.
pam She's talking about the handprints that celebrities make in the cement.
michael I love it!
jim If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
michael I love it more!
oscar michael that doesn't seem. safe.
michael I. love it!! Haha, come on!
dwight Come on!
jim We are here today, not to immortalize a man, but an idea. Maybe the idea of a man.
michael Hurry, please.
jim Greatness is only skin deep, some people say.
dwight Can you breathe?
jim Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside.
dwight Hold your breath.
jim And in this case.
dwight Ready?
jim That's also not true.
dwight And. go. Force it in as deep as you can.
michael That's what she said.
michael Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids. I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, "That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole. " I dunno, it's a good feeling.
andy Okay, adjective.
angela Um. tall. No, no, uh, nice.
andy Good one. Okay, you ready?
angela Mmhmm.
andy The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. "Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good. cat food?"
angela It's a man eating cat food.
andy What about a cat eating man food?
dwight andy and angela seem very happy. I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
pam Um. yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so. I had to wear my backup glasses. Shut up.
michael All right, everybody. Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction.
pam I don't have my contacts.
michael Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
michael Ener-gize.
jim You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly.
pam Don't, don't--
jim Would.
pam If you propose to me during a michael meeting, I will say no.
jim Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing. that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
michael Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
andy What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more. zing, and a little more pep?
michael Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
jim What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
michael Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme.
jim An urban thing.
michael An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?. Stanley, earth to Stanley.
stanley Not me.
michael Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
stanley No.
michael Stanley, we're havin a little.
stanley Leave me alone, dammit.
michael We're havin a little brainstorm session.
stanley DID I STUTTER?
michael . Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
toby Can I talk to you a second?
michael Ugh, what?
toby Uh, I really think that you need to address what happened with stanley this morning.
michael What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
toby Well, you know, stanley was openly insubordinate.
michael That? In the conference room?
toby Yeah.
michael We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter, " and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
toby He didn't seem like he was joking.
michael Well you don't get it, because stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're. you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one
another "Hey um, you're poor. " "Well hey, you're mama's dead. " That's what friends do. It's. you're so white.
toby Alright. Well, um, if you really believe that stanley was joking.
michael Mmhmm.
toby Um, why don't you go ask him that?
michael Okay, I will. I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but.
toby You know, Michael, sometimes my daughter's stomach hurts when there's a mean girl at school.
michael Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
andy You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
dwight Unh! Scratch.
andy That's a racing stripe.
dwight Uh, bumper's sagging.
andy Mmm, I doubt that very much.
dwight This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
andy How next to?
dwight Well, here are your
options you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff. you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.
andy I have to pick one of those?
dwight Yes.
andy Can you go over those options again?
dwight You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
andy Well I have the, the blue book value.
dwight Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
andy Can I think about it?
dwight Five, four, three, two.
andy Let me think about it--
dwight Now. Now. Now.
andy Let me think about it--
dwight Say it. Do it. Now.
andy I'm thinking about it--
dwight Do it now.
andy Thinking--
dwight Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
andy Yeah. All right!
stanley What.
michael I, uh, see that you. gave me that form that I asked you to give me, stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
stanley What are you talking about?
michael Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
stanley I am not going to apologize to you. . push;
stanley It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
dwight jim is in charge of stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
michael Uh huh.
dwight There is this yellow zigzag that does give ryan the authority to discipline Stanley.
michael Great
dwight However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
michael What's the pink?
dwight Menstrual cycles.
michael Ok. Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
dwight You.
michael Other than me.
dwight Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
michael I never said you could do that.
dwight All you have to do it say it.
michael I.
dwight Just say it.
michael Okay, I will think about it.
dwight Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two. do it. Give me control. Michael. I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
michael No.
dwight So. All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
kevin Hey Pam, I really like your glasses.
pam Oh, thanks.
kevin All the girlfriends that I've ever had have worn glasses.
pam Oh, okay.
kevin Yeah, it's kind of a turn-on for me actually.
pam I should probably get back to.
kevin Like librarians.
pam Entering the. .
kevin Could you just say, "these are due back Thursday"?
pam No. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead.
creed A lot of jazz cats are blind, but they can play the piano like nobody's business. I'd like to put the piano in front of pam without her glasses and see what happens. I'd also like to see her topless.
darryl Mike.
michael Hey.
darryl I'm very busy here, man.
michael Darryl, have you ever been in a gang?
darryl Why?
michael It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um.
darryl No, no, no.
michael I know, it's very, very personal.
darryl No, um. I have.
michael I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
darryl Both.
michael God.
darryl Yeah them, and the Latin Kings. the Warriors.
michael Okay.
darryl Newsies.
michael Okay, so dig
this you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
darryl Oh my goodness.
michael Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
darryl Well see, um. in the gang world, we use something called Fluffy Fingers.
michael What is that?
darryl That's when somebody really gets in your face, you know, you just. start tickling them.
michael Really?
darryl Yeah, and then he starts tickling you. You know, pretty soon you're laughing and hugging. Before you know it, you've forgotten the whole thing. Ya'll can just go to church together. get an ice cream cone.
michael I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
darryl Well, it's effective.
ryan I think it's self-explanatory. Hey, Jim, come here for a second. Can you answer me something, as, as a true Eagles fan?
jim Oh boy.
ryan How do you live with a franchise this bad?
jim On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
ryan Alright, whatever you say. Uh, listen, while I have you here with Toby, I need to give you a formal warning about your job performance.
jim A formal warning.
ryan It's actually not a joke. I know how you spend your time here, and I know how little you care about your job. And honestly if you spent as much time selling as you do goofing around with dwight and hanging out at reception, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
jim I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
ryan This is nothing to do with that, alright? I always appreciate constructive criticism about my job performance. I thrive on it.
jim I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really.
ryan Woah, don't get all defensive, alright? It's just a warning. If you want the details, toby can provide them. You take it easy, alright?
toby I'd say all the goofing around at Pam's desk, and, and hanging out with Pam, has finally caught up to him. w-with pam
pam Hey, what happened? What did ryan want?
jim Oh we were just. talking about, bureaucratic stuff.
pam Because you're very important?
jim Yeah.
dwight Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
andy What the hell is this all about? You're flipping my car for profit.
dwight It's my car now.
andy I gave you a deal. based on what you said to me.
dwight Yeah, well. seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
dwight I've got a Madlib for
you a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.
michael Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, stanley sassed me, and toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.
pam What does that mean?
michael It's like a mock execution.
jim That's not a good idea.
michael Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
toby Well, you can actually fire him.
michael No, okay. I've had enough of you.
oscar Why are you telling us this?
michael Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
kevin Michael, if you hadn't told us this, then we would've thought that you were actually firing him.
michael I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just. play act. Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
michael stanley Hudson, you are fired.
stanley Are you serious?
michael I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
stanley You're firing me over three words. Have you lost your mind? Do you think I'm gonna let you do this to me?
michael Hmm.
stanley I've watched you screw up this office for ten years, and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm gonna tell them about every stupid thing you've ever done up in this office.
michael Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
stanley So I'm not fired.
michael That's it. And uh. do you have anything to say to me?
stanley Oh yes, I do. You are out of your damn, little pea-sized, mind. What is wrong with you? Do you have any sense? At all?
michael Okay.
stanley Do you have any idea how to run an office?
michael Yes.
stanley Every day you do something stupider than you did the day before.
michael That's not-
stanley And I think, "there's no possible way--
michael All right, all right.
stanley He can top that. "
michael Okay.
stanley But what do you do?! You find a way, dammit, to top it! You are professional idiot!
michael Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
jim Who?
michael Everybody, except Stanley.
jim Let's go.
pam I can't find my glasses.
jim Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
pam Okay, okay.
kevin It's michael versus Stanley, and it is the clash of the titans. In one corner, you have Michael, and he is mad. And then, in the other corner, you have Stanley, and he's mad. So that's about it!
michael I don't understand why you keep picking on me.
stanley Oh, for the love of God.
michael You just, do, and I don't know why, so. please help me understand.
stanley Fine. Here it
is you are a person I do not respect. The things you say, your actions, your methods, and style. Everything you would do, I would do it the opposite way.
michael Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
stanley michael I have known you a very long time, and the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you. Any other theories?
michael All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
stanley Fair enough.
michael I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after s*x, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, "I don't respect you!" Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. Respect is niiice. Borat. What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!
michael So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?
stanley Has potential to be your best idea yet.
phyllis That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
michael Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
