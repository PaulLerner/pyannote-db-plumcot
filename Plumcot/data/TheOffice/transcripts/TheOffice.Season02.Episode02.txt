michael_scott Hey, what's up?
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott Any emails today?
jim_halpert Um... I don't think so.
michael_scott No? Um... Check your spam folder.
jim_halpert Oh! There it is!
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
michael_scott
jim_halpert Well done.
michael_scott Kay.
jim_halpert Topical.
michael_scott I am king of forwards. It's how I like to do business, everybody joking around. We're like 'Friends'. I am Chandler and Joey and, uh, Pam is Rachel. And Dwight is Kramer.
dwight_schrute So the monkey does the s*x thing right here!
michael_scott That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
dwight_schrute Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
michael_scott Um, I...
dwight_schrute Consider it?
michael_scott Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... Whup! Come on! Hey!
todd_packer Packer What has two thumbs and likes to bone your Mom? This guy!
michael_scott Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
todd_packer Packer
michael_scott Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.
todd_packer Packer bleep, bleep. What's up, Halpert?
michael_scott Uh oh.
todd_packer Packer Still queer?
michael_scott Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
michael_scott Todd Packer and I are total BFF. Best Friends Forever. He and I came up together as salesmen. One time, we were out and we met this set of twins. And Packer told them that we were brothers. And so, you know, one thing led to another, and we brought em back to the motel. And then Packer did both of them. It was awesome. So...
michael_scott Oh-whoa-oh! Oh! Okay. Grade 'A' gossip for you, right now. Randall, CFO, resigned. Nobody knows why.
todd_packer Packer Are you kidding? Everyone knows why! You don't know? Okay, check this out. Al lright. So here's the story. So Randall is nailing his secretary, right? And she is totally incompetent.
michael_scott Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
todd_packer Packer We're talking blonde incompetent.
michael_scott Oh, yeah.
todd_packer Packer Like 10 words a minute... talking.
michael_scott Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.
todd_packer Packer They are women, right?
michael_scott Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
todd_packer Packer I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.
michael_scott Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
jim_halpert Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer? This guy!
todd_packer Packer Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?
michael_scott Oh. Bad boy. Um... Ryan?
todd_packer Packer Come on, kid. Let's go.
michael_scott Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
jim_halpert Except pass that breathalyzer.
ryan_howard You a big William Hung fan?
todd_packer Packer Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?
kevin_malone computer
jim_halpert I'm really excited to meet your Mom.
pam_beesly You are?
pam_beesly My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.
pam_beesly I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.
jim_halpert Oh yeah?
pam_beesly mmhmm.
jim_halpert Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
pam_beesly Oh really?
jim_halpert Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
michael_scott Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School".
toby_flenderson Michael?
michael_scott Yes, Toby?
toby_flenderson Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.
michael_scott Um... literally two seconds?
michael_scott Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.
toby_flenderson The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.
michael_scott No, no, Toby. No.
toby_flenderson It's really not a big deal, Michael.
michael_scott It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
toby_flenderson And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...
michael_scott What?
toby_flenderson Just to refresh you... .
michael_scott NO!
toby_flenderson on our policy.
michael_scott What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
toby_flenderson Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
michael_scott There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
michael_scott Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. So, take it away.
toby_flenderson Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
michael_scott I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
michael_scott A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says "Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?" This is what's at stake.
michael_scott Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
darryl_philbin Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
michael_scott Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
darryl_philbin Well, those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
roy_anderson Boys R Us!
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 Guy Oh!
michael_scott Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
darryl_philbin Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
michael_scott Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
roy_anderson Hey, hey, hey.
michael_scott What?
roy_anderson So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
michael_scott I don't feel bad.
darryl_philbin I think he feels bad.
michael_scott No, I don't.
roy_anderson You look like you feel bad.
michael_scott Okay.
roy_anderson Little package!
michael_scott Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 guy Little package! Little package!
michael_scott Thank you.
roy_anderson You look good.
darryl_philbin Hiding from his momma.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 guys
toby_flenderson So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
pam_beesly Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
kevin_malone MILF!
pam_beesly Thanks, Kevin.
pam_beesly Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.
pam_beesly She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
toby_flenderson Great point.
pam_beesly Thank you.
toby_flenderson Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
michael_scott Hi, is it over?
toby_flenderson Uh, yes!
michael_scott No.
toby_flenderson I can go over it with you.
michael_scott I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
toby_flenderson It's over.
michael_scott Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
angela_martin Email forwards.
michael_scott Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
angela_martin I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
michael_scott Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
stanley_hudson That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
meredith_palmer Um... what about office romance?
toby_flenderson Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
phyllis_vance All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
michael_scott I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
dwight_schrute Yeah, Meredith.
michael_scott No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott She would have definitely slept with me.
kevin_malone She wasn't that hot.
michael_scott Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
toby_flenderson Ok, you know, Michael...
jim_halpert I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.
michael_scott What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her "partner" in to work? Would that be crossing the line?
toby_flenderson No.
michael_scott What if they made out? In front of everybody?
toby_flenderson Well, that would be...
michael_scott At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
toby_flenderson Okay, I'm lost.
michael_scott Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
Video#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02
michael_scott I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
jim_halpert No, thanks. I'm good.
michael_scott That's what she said. Pam?
pam_beesly Uh... my mother's coming.
michael_scott That's what she sai Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
dwight_schrute Hey, Toby.
toby_flenderson Hey Dwight.
dwight_schrute You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
toby_flenderson Sure.
dwight_schrute Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?
toby_flenderson Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
toby_flenderson Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
dwight_schrute Good. Good. And...
toby_flenderson I should get back to work.
dwight_schrute Okay.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 in Video In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'
Video#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 The Natural Redhead]
roy_anderson Natural redhead.
Actor#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 Hey, Rach.
Redheaded#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 Actress Hey, Joe. Mike.
Actor#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
darryl_philbin Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. I banged this girl right here. This is...
roy_anderson That's her?
darryl_philbin Yes, this is the one.
roy_anderson No!
darryl_philbin You remember? Yes!
roy_anderson At the party?
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 guy You banged her?
darryl_philbin Yes! Right here. You are a naughty girl!
michael_scott Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
jan_levinson Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. Hi.
michael_scott Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
todd_packer Packer Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
pam_beesly I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
todd_packer Packer Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.
michael_scott So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
omalley O'Malley I love lawyer jokes.
michael_scott Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
michael_scott When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.
jan_levinson You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
michael_scott The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
jan_levinson Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
michael_scott Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
jan_levinson Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
michael_scott No, I've seen the video.
toby_flenderson He talked the whole time.
michael_scott No, I didn't. Huh, what?
michael_scott Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
jim_halpert Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
michael_scott Mmmhmm. Yes.
jim_halpert Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
michael_scott THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
jan_levinson Michael. MICHAEL!
michael_scott Come on.
jan_levinson Michael, please.
todd_packer Packer There he is.
michael_scott Mwah!
todd_packer Packer There he is. Good one.
michael_scott You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
jan_levinson Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
michael_scott It's... That's...
jan_levinson That's not my sense of humor.
michael_scott Okay. Hello. Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
jan_levinson Wha...
michael_scott I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Albiny#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
michael_scott This guy does it all.
jan_levinson 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
michael_scott What?
jan_levinson Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
michael_scott So I'm not in trouble?
michael_scott I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.
michael_scott Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
Albiny#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode02 Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
michael_scott I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
pams_mom Mom Um... hello.
pam_beesly Oh my god!
pams_mom Mom Finally made it!
pam_beesly Hello!
pam_beesly I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.
pams_mom Mom This is all yours?
pam_beesly Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
pams_mom Mom Oh, my goodness. That's great.
todd_packer Packer So a guy goes home, tells his wife, "Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery." She goes, "Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?" He goes, "I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!" Boom!
pam_beesly This is where I used to keep my computer.
pams_mom Mom Oh, right! I remember...
pam_beesly But then I moved it.
pams_mom Mom with the picture.
pam_beesly Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
pams_mom Mom Sure.
pam_beesly So this is like, um, an organization station...
pams_mom Mom Oooooh!
pam_beesly Hey!
pams_mom Mom Well, there he is!
roy_anderson How are ya?
pams_mom Mom Hi, handsome!
roy_anderson You look great!
pams_mom Mom Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?
pam_beesly Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
pams_mom Mom Oh, I don't believe that.
roy_anderson Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
pams_mom Mom Oh, anything is fine.
roy_anderson All right, I'll see ya.
pams_mom Mom So which one is Jim?
pam_beesly Mom!
pams_mom Mom I just wanted to know.
pam_beesly No.
pams_mom Mom All right. Okay.
pam_beesly Ten minutes.
pams_mom Mom Okay.
pam_beesly Then we can go to dinner.
pams_mom Mom I'll make myself busy.
todd_packer Packer There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh...
kevin_malone Phyllis?
michael_scott No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
todd_packer Packer Ex-squeeze me?
michael_scott Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
kevin_malone Packer said it.
michael_scott No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
phyllis_vance I'm the same age as you, Michael.
michael_scott I don't know about that.
phyllis_vance We're in the same High School class.
michael_scott Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
kevin_malone You mean where my desk is?
michael_scott Yes, your corner. Go.
kevin_malone Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
michael_scott Mmmhmmm.
todd_packer Packer Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
michael_scott They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.
phyllis_vance Michael! Come on!
michael_scott Oooh!
phyllis_vance You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
michael_scott I'm not worried.
phyllis_vance ...report you to HR.
michael_scott You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
michael_scott Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.
pam_beesly He said what?
