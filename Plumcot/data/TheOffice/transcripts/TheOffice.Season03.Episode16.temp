jim Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
dwight What do you think?
jim In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
jim Dwight, want an Altoid?
dwight Okay.
jim Altoid?
dwight Sure
jim Mint Dwight?
dwight Inbwit? Yes.
dwight 
jim What are you doing?
dwight I.
jim What?
dwight I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.
michael Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?
photographer Okay, for this next one everyone hop out. Just phyllis and Dad. Actually, let's bring Mom back in. And the sisters. And you, and you, and you. Great.
michael phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.
phyllis Yes, I put michael in my wedding. It was the only way I could think to get six weeks off for my honeymoon. No one else has ever gotten six weeks before.
pam Phyllis. ended up using the exact same invitations as roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.
jim So what's in the box?
stanley A toaster, you?
karen A toaster.
stanley Unbelievable.
dwight Hello, Angela.
angela Hi, Dwight.
dwight You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
angela Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
dwight The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
jim Those flowers are nice.
karen Yeah. P and R?
jim phyllis and Robert.
karen Ah, of course.
pam Also, pam and Roy.
michael There she is. I swear phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.
phyllis Thanks, Michael. That's sweet. Same as when you said it outside.
michael How you doin'? You excited.
phyllis Yes, very.
michael Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
phyllis No.
michael You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous.
phyllis That wasn't me.
michael Okay. umm. I'm sure that Bob. Wow. That is. that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah. Are you set on that hairstyle?
phyllis I thought it was.
michael Here, let me.
phyllis Michael. No.
michael Just cover up that bald patch.
phyllis I don't need your. thank you. No, michael please. I just need some time alone.
michael Okay.
michael You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.
michael I hate you!
michael Long story
short Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.
dwight Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
jim You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
dwight No way.
jim Did you ever see that movie?
dwight Of course I saw it.
dwight I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
jim You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
dwight Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
kevin Hi. I'm Kevin. Where did you find her?
toby At the gym.
kevin Riiight. The gym.
kelly Could you scoot over? You're on my dress.
meredith I thought you're not supposed to wear white to a wedding.
kelly I know but there was an emergency.
kelly I look really good in white.
michael This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.
pam That's my dress.
michael That's ok.
dwight It's a miracle.
crowd 
michael This is bull****!
michael Me walking phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now. the wedding has no highlight.
michael I can't believe I pushed that. that guy's lazy ass around all day. until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's. well. I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
priest And do you, Phyllis, take bob Vance, vance Refrigeration, to be your lawfully wedded husband?
phyllis I do.
michael Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. bob Vance!

angela Congratulations, Phyllis. You look lovely. Your dress is very white. So white, my eyes are burning.
phyllis Thanks Angela.
michael Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know. if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you. bob
vance If you ever lay I finger on Phyllis, I'll kill you.
michael Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
dwight Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
phyllis I don't have that, Dwight.
dwight Dammit, Phyllis!
kelly Are you all right? This must be so awful for you.
pam What do you mean?
kelly Well. this was supposed to be your wedding.
pam Oh. um. no. That's. um. That's actually fine
kelly There's no way it's fine. I'm sorry. If I was you, I would just like freak out and get really drunk and then tell someone I was pregnant.
pam Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
dwight 'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple? 
Uncle al Who?
dwight The bride and groom? What are their names? 
Uncle al Oh, I. I don't. I'm not sure.
dwight Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on. 
Uncle al Okay, Okay. Where are we going?
dwight Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend. 
Uncle al Oh!
michael Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?
phyllis It's beautiful. Why don't you find your seat. Enjoy the buffet.
michael I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
phyllis It's fish.
michael I will take care of that.
michael I do. I know a fair amount about fine food. and drink. This is a white.
kevin No this is not our first wedding. This is the THIRD wedding that Scrantonicity has played. We also played our bassist's wedding and our guitarist's wedding.
kevin Attention, everyone. Attention, please. I am supposed to ask if anyone has seen Uncle Al. He is old and has brown eyes and dementia. His family is very concerned. It is a very serious situation. Roxanne. You don't have to put on your red light.
roy Hey.
pam Hey.
roy I know I normally don't notice these kind of things but uh. This wedding's really nice! I mean, the flowers and stuff? phyllis has got some great taste.
pam You're kidding me, right?
roy I know you're probably not going to remember this, right? But um. Those color roses? I got you those color roses for our prom.
pam Roy, I picked those flowers. phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.
roy I uh guess I wasn't really too involved in the planning.
pam Yeah.
roy Sorry about that.
pam It's okay.
roy You think this sucks for you? I was the one who actually wanted to get married.
randy Phyllis, you're a wonderful woman. And you're a hell of a bowler!
crowd 
unknown She is.
randy Cheers.
crowd Cheers.
michael Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of phyllis Lapin and bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige.
michael The most important part of a speech is the opening line. When time is not a factor, I like to try out three or four different ones.
michael phyllis and
bob their celebrity couple name would be Phlob. You look at her. and she's kind of matronly today, but back in High School, I swear, her nickname was 'Easy Rider'. Now as for Bob. bob Vance. bob
vance Oh okay. That's enough.
michael is a guy that. bob
vance Thanks, Michael. Give me.
michael he works. Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay. bob
vance Give me the microphone.
michael No. I'm not going to. bob
vance Give me. Give me the microphone, Michael.
michael Ok. All right. bob
vance You're out of here!
michael Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're. Yeah. I hate you!

pam Oh. I'm pacing myself.
jim Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
pam No. I'm such a dorky dancer.
jim I know. It's very cute.
jim Hypothetically, if I thought pam was interested, then. No, it's totally hypothetical.
michael Come. Come on!
dwight I can't let you in, Michael.
michael Dwight, just.
dwight No, it's bob and Phyllis' orders.
michael Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
dwight You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
michael OK.
roy Hey, they're playing our song.
pam Yeah, that's weird. I thought they only played the Police.
roy I know. Uh. I gave them twenty bucks. You want to dance?
michael ee. I was meant for you. buppity du bom bu.
roy Hey, want to get out of here?
jim Here's a 'not hypothetical'. I'm really happy I'm with Karen.
karen Every little thing she does is magic. Every little thing she do just turns me on. Even though my life before was tragic. Now I know my love for her goes on. Every.
women One. Two. Three. Ahhhh!
toby Toby! Yeah!
michael I just want phyllis to have a great day. 
Uncle al phyllis and you will be great together.
michael We are great together. We are a great team. 
Uncle al The Celtics were a great team.
michael Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon. 
michael Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
michael Phyllis. Phyllis! Wait! Please. I'm sorry. I just. I just wanted to make this a day to remember.
phyllis You found Uncle Al!
michael Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
phyllis Thank you, Michael.
michael You're. You're welcome.
michael They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.
michael Be careful. Oh no!! Oh wow! Phyllis! Phyllis! You look like a clown! Here. Get me! Get me!
