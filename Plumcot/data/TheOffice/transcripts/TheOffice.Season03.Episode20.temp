andy Good morning, Pam.
pam Oh, welcome back, Andy.
andy Drew. I'm Drew now.
pam Oh. Drew. Sorry.
andy Apology not. accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place.
andy Several weeks ago, andy Bernard had an incident. But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And. a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
andy Mornin' Jim.
jim Hey, Andy. How are you, man?
andy Good. Drew.
jim What's that?
andy Dr--- You can call me Drew.
jim No, I'm not gonna call you that.
andy Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do.
jim Andy.
andy Drew. Dwight. How's it goin' man?
dwight Yes, I have decided to shun andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday. for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
dwight Jim, could you please inform andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
jim Andy, dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
dwight Ok, tell him that's not true.
jim dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
andy You guys.
dwight Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!
jim Andy! Nah, that's too far.
dwight Damn you.
michael Today is Safety Training Day. toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
darryl Now, this is the forklift. You need--- You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. . Quiz! Mike.
michael Hmm.
darryl Should you drive the forklift?
michael I can, and I have.
darryl No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand?
lonny You're not allowed to drive the forklift.
darryl It's not safe, you don't have a license.
michael Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. Pudge has driven the forklift.
madge Madge.
michael I thought your name was Pudge?
madge No, it's always been Madge.
michael Okay. Um, her.
darryl Her. Yes, "her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay?
michael Ah, fine.
darryl Do you understand that?
michael Yeeesh.
darryl We do safety training every year, or after an accident. . We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled.
michael "Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!"
darryl And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
darryl The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
dwight Yeah!
andy It's on!
darryl How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
michael Bail'er? I hardly know her.
lonny Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man.
darryl Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody?
kevin Five bucks says it's over 50.
jim You really wanna bet?
darryl Anybody?
kevin Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
guy How many?
jim Ok, you're on.
darryl Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them?
kevin Damn.
darryl You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful.
jim No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'.
kevin On what?
jim I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
kevin Nice.
oscar What are you guys talkin' about?
darryl These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, Michael, should not go anywhere near them.
michael Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. if somebody.
darry It would be the worst thing in the world! It would! Very much so.
lonny What the hell is wrong with this man?
michael It's a big red trash compactor!
lonny What are you---
darryl It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler!
lonny Don't disrespect the baler!
michael Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. . Only on the rarest of occasions.
darryl No do not touch it!
michael . would I go near---
darryl There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
michael toby now has the floor. and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!
toby Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
michael Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and.
toby Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about. about ten minutes every hour.
michael Wow, that is. that time really adds up. That's like. a half an hour, every hour?
darryl Take them at the same time.
michael Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
toby No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
ryan What about a long sleeve T?
toby Well, that'll work.
kevin Long johns? A shaw?
toby You know, anything that warms you.
michael Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. Sorry, he is very lame. Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter. "
darryl Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
lonny Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?
michael Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
darryl Actually, you did.
michael Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
toby Sedentary.
michael Yes. "Which can contribute to heart disease. " Heart disease kills more people that balers.
lonny That's called having a fat butt, Michael.
michael Mmmm, no, no, it's. sedentary.
lonny Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from?
michael No.
lonny Fat butt disease, Michael?
kelly Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
lonny Yeah? I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you?
kelly Ryan?
lonny Dude, tell your girl to shut up.
kelly What?!
ryan Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize.
kelly Are you kidding me?
darryl Alright, we outta here.
michael Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---
lonny Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.
darryl That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it.
michael Okay. . What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
michael darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I. "Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today. " . This is one example.
kevin Ten.
oscar Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant.
jim There's like ten green ones.
oscar Forty-two.
jim I'm gonna say fifty.
karen Fifty-one.
jim Oh, don't be that person.
kevin That is lame.
karen It's a strategy!
pam It's called being smart.
karen Thank you.
kevin Oh, geeze.
pam I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
pam Ten.
jim Kev's out.
kevin Damn it.
pam 47, 48, 49! jim wins!
everyone Oooh!
kevin That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours.
jim Okay, okay.
kevin No, constantly. Like, for years.
jim Okay. . push;
michael Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
pam I don't understand the question.
michael Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.
pam Yeah.
michael I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that.
pam It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.
michael Yeah. you are. ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight. and you know science.
pam So, you're okay?
michael Indubitably.
michael They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
dwight Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?
michael I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---
dwight Wolves.
michael Nn--- Depression.
dwight Visual aids.
michael Yes.
dwight A quilt. Depression quilt?
micheal No time to sew a quilt. . I got it. Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.
michael You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I. tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, "Hey! You ever seen a suicide?" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see. the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side
note They might think "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael. " But that's. not why I'm doing this. Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner. Ta-freakin'-da!
kelly So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome. And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!? What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works?
ryan I guess I forgot.
kelly You're such a ditz.
kevin Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
dwight Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!
michael Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or.
dwight We measured it once.
michael Go buy some watermelons.
dwight Seedless?
michael Just.
toby creed is eating an apple. I found a potato.
pam Hey Creed.
creed Hey!
pam Hey.
creed Hello.
pam Yes!
kevin Here you go.
toby Nice.
karen I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out.
dwight Ready?
michael Let's do it! Drop that sucker.
dwight 
michael BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh. crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.
dwight Okay.
michael Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
dwight Got it.
michael Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
dwight We're not allowed to use the baler.
michael Have Pa--adge do it, or. the sea monster.
dwight I'm on it!
dwight I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
andy Thank you.
dwight It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.
andy Anything.
dwight Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
andy You mean a moon bounce.
dwight What do you think? You've got an hour.
andy I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need petty cash.
dwight Shunning resumed.
andy Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
dwight Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.
dwight Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision.
michael Yes, thank you for seeing that.
dwight When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
michael I don't know if I wanna do this.
dwight Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
michael No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.
dwight That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll!
michael Rock n' roll!
dwight Yeah!
michael That's right! I am not thinking.
dwight Near near near near near!
michael Yes! Yeah!
dwight michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof!
michael Woo!
dwight Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!
michael Woo!
dwight Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
michael I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!
dwight Guys! Listen up! michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
andy Whoa! What's the situation?
dwight Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
andy Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?
dwight Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
stanley Is it nice outside?
dwight It's gorgeous. Let's go!
stanley Do I need my jacket?
dwight No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!
ryan Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
dwight Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!
dwight Come on, hurry up you guys!
michael My life! Oh, my life.
dwight Michael, what's wrong?!
michael Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
dwight Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
michael Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!
dwight Is that the last year the data was available?
michael Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
dwight Don't do anything rash!
michael Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
dwight I didn't. I didn't think you needed them for this part.
michael Okay. that's.
dwight you said to just.
michael That's the whole point, dummy.
dwight Okay, I'm on it!
michael Okay.
dwight Attention blue collar workers!
pam What are the odds that this is in any way real?
jim I'd say like. 10, 000 to 1?
kevin Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
kevin If someone gives you 10, 000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude.
dwight Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
michael Oooooh, my life!
dwight Michael! What's wrong?
michael Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
dwight Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
michael Dwight, you ignorant slut.
jim Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
michael And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
jim Oh, excuse me. It's my. favorite part.
angela This is just offensive.
ryan At least we're outside.
creed Hey, check it out, there's a. there's a castle over there.
jim Oh my God, there is a castle.
dwight No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. . They found the castle, Michael.
michael Damn it.
pam Oh. God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
jim Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
pam Yeah.
jim Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
pam Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
michael What is it?
pam Come down and. open it and you'll see.
michael Dwight, find out what the present is.
dwight Okay, uh. I don't see anything. She might be bluffing.
jim Dwight.
pam Dwight, what are you---
dwight Oh. It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
michael Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?
darryl Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
michael You told me, that I lead a. cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
darryl Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
michael What do I have to live for?
darryl A lot. of things. Uh, you, uh. What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right?
michael It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The s*x isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
darryl Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you.
michael Do you really mean that?
darryl I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave.
michael I'm braver than you?
darryl Way braver! You Braveheart, man.
michael I Braveheart. I am.
darryl Come down, okay?
michael Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
michael An office. is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes.
