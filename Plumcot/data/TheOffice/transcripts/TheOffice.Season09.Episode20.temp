erin Oh. Hey, champions.
toby Good morning.
clark Quater finals in an hour. Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
erin I did. I got some really good sleep.
clark Did you?
erin Bzzz.
dwight Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. Practically made of plastic.
nellie We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill , others relied on showmanship others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
toby Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep.
toby Ow! Ow!
pam I didn't see you! You should have yelled "Crossing!"
toby I'm sorry!
pam Ok, so is that my spot?
nellie We are now down to an elite eight. Well, seven and Toby.
andy Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
darryl It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
andy Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
andy Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols. It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt. And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
toby Andy?
andy Go away, we're running lines.
toby You wanted to see the gooey eye.
andy Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
toby Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
andy Yeah, Ok. Alright. Where were we?
darryl Something full of acid.
andy And
remember Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
darryl That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
andy W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere. I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
jim Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
pam Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
pam So, we had couple's therapy.
jim No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
pam And we have homework.
jim Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
pam And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
jim Mmhm.
pam Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
jim Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do "opportunities. "
andy Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow. Carla fern got me a gig.
pam Hey!
andy Yeah.
stanley Who's Carla Fern?
andy Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
oscar Why wouldn't you use your own life? erin just dumped you.
andy Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
oscar But you just!
andy Not cool.
nellie Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
robert Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?
dwight I'm pumped!
erin Clark's a dead man.
robert Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this.
angela Oh my god!
group Whoa.
angela nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
nellie Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was. um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
stanley Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
nellie I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
erin Nellie, this is a competition. Please take it seriously.
nellie Oh please.
angela Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator. But my new studio apartment is just fine for me. and Phillip. and Tinky. and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
phillip 
angela Come here, come here. Let's go.
angela I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
dwight I offered myself to angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, angela was at best indifferent.
clark Oh, wide wings, interesting.
erin Hey. Why don't you back off?. I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
erin Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix. Carla
fern Are you in that paper documentary too?
darryl Yep. Carla
fern Do you need an agent?
andy No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
darryl I was in The Whiz in high school.
andy That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says "action. " Carla
fern Hey, I made them get you a chair. All my clients sit.
woman Can I take your picture?
andy I guess it's starting. Um, yeah. Of course. Yeah sure. Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
woman We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off.
andy Got it.
woman No, if you could just keep it down until.
andy Sorry.
nellie OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. kevin versus Angela.
kevin Yes!
dwight Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?
kevin Uh huh.
dwight Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
kevin Of course.
nellie Kevin, did you make that yourself?
kevin Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
nellie Oh man.
dwight I call for a refold!
kevin No.
angela Really? Thank you.
kevin This is flatter.
dwight It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
nellie Ok, that's enough. This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
kevin I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
nellie You have to choose one now.
kevin Fine.
nellie angela advances.
erin Nice.
dwight Whoo!
angela Was dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
kevin I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher. . push;
jim An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
pam Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
jim Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
pam Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March. There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
director We are rolling and. action!
andy This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
producer Ok, um, stop. Um, why are you smiling so much?
andy Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
director Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one.
andy So how do you want, how should I do it?
director I don't know, just like you're reporting the news or something. Ok?
andy This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
director Ok.
andy It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.
director Who was that?
andy Tom Brokaw!
dwight Come on Clark!
angela Come on Clark.
dwight Whoa!
erin Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
clark We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
erin I can't hear what you said. You got your slop?
clark You know what, this is completely unnecessary. You already won.
pete Erin! Erin! Just stop.
erin What?
pete Relax.
nellie Next up we have dwight and Phyllis. Bob Vance, Vance
refrigeration You can do it baby!
angela No you can't baby! Good luck.
dwight Watch and learn.
erin Wow.
group Oh!
nellie dwight defeats Phyllis, dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
dwight Yes!
angela Whoo!
dwight Oh, Esther.
esther Hey.
dwight What are you- You're here early.
esther Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.
dwight I like a little feather in my nuggets.
nellie Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
erin Yeah!
director Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye.
andy Which is insanely painful.
director Yeah.
andy And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
director That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes. You know, get the chemicals out. Alright?
andy So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
director What water special effect?
producer Yeah, yeah just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs.
andy I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
director Dude, we don't need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That's all we're asking.
andy Darryl, what do I do?
darryl Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
andy They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
darryl So?
andy I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball. I've never even used an eye dropper. Production
assistant So Andy, so you know how to use this. You step on the pedal, water squirts in your eyes.
andy Carla! Carla!
nellie It is time for a little T &amp; A. I give
you toby and Angela.
angela Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [toby crumples plane and steps aside.
nellie Well, angela is the winner.
angela Yes!
esther Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?
dwight Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
esther Oh. Is she a gambler?
dwight In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
esther Hmm. That is sad. Carla
fern Andy! If you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania. You won't even make an appearance on a security camera!
producer What's the hold up here?
director The actor's crying.
producer Oh god.
andy She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
darryl andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab assistant Number One.
andy Do you believe in me?
darryl I believe I want to go home.
dwight Yeah! Ok! Beat that! Whoo! Ok.
erin Dammit! Dammit, god. Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I'm really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
pete Yeah. Whoa!
erin Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
pete Ok Hey hey hey, whoa.
erin Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just.
pam Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
jim Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
pam I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
jim Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
pam Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant-
jim Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
pam Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. I appreciate the sacrifice.
jim Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
pam Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
jim I guess I will swallow my truth.
clark Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
pam We're not high.
pam I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so. blocked up.
kevin The Mark 47 is ready for launch. Less paste.
director Here we go. Rolling and. action!
andy AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
director And cut. We can fix the sound in post.
producer Yeah.
andy I can do a better one.
producer That's fine, we'll move on.
andy I said I can do a better one. Darryl.
darryl Action!
andy AHH! AHH! AHH! Carla
fern Kid can act!
andy Yeah! Yeah.
nellie Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
dwight After you.
angela Thank you. Oh god!
nellie Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.
dwight Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God.
esther We want you to win. dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely.
dwight Alright.
angela Don't you dare tank this.
nellie And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
creed Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
angela Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
angela I was disappointed in dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
jim I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
pam Ok.
pam Jim!
jim Thanks.
pam Alright, have a good trip.
jim Bye.
pam Bye.
jim Hey! I.
pastor Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. And now these three
remain Faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
pam I love you.
jim I love you.
