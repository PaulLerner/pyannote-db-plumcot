andy_bernard Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here.
erin_hannon
andy_bernard Closing time.
andy_bernard Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over. Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day. It's weird.
andy_bernard Closing time
jim_halpert ...W R K.
andy_bernard One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.
jim_halpert Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten. Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
andy_bernard Come on pam!
andy_bernard@pam_beesly Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
pam_beesly Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.
andy_bernard I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. Take me hooo...hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing... no traditions!
stanley_hudson Closing time every new beginning...
stanley_hudson I've never heard that song before. And once I heard it, I did not care for it, but that song means it's time to go home. Now...it's my favorite song.
andy_bernard@stanley_hudson Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings end.
stanley_hudson Goodnight.
andy_bernard Whose your favorite iron chef?
robert_california This is atrocious.
andy_bernard You go first.
robert_california The ticketing software paints a picture of a sloppy, careless, error prone office.
andy_bernard Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes...
dwight_schrute Sorry, go ahead.
robert_california Did you need something from us?
dwight_schrute Wha...Yes. Your attention. Uh because... No that is all.
dwight_schrute Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
robert_california Last week an accounting mistake resulted in a client getting their order for free.
andy_bernard Umpf...that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.
robert_california Who are they?
andy_bernard They're both Kevin. Oscar is the s*x and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture...
robert_california Andrew sometimes I feel like you don't know me at all.
andy_bernard I would agree with that.
robert_california Simply...end the mistakes
andy_bernard End the mistakes, easy-
robert_california When I come back next week and this report shows me no mistakes, we can talk about names, all day. Our favorite names, silly made up names, normal names said in a silly voice. Wouldn't that be nice?
andy_bernard I would like that.
robert_california End the mistakes. That is all I ask. And you can't have a favorite Iron Chef. It depends entirely on the secret ingredient. Sometimes I feel you don't know food at all.
jim_halpert I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So...my pitch is...me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.
darryl_philbin Nahh! No. Not Justine. Never Justine.
jim_halpert Is that off again?
darryl_philbin Oh yeah.
jim_halpert Ok.
val Hey, mandatory warehouse safety meeting. Today.
darryl_philbin Ahh...We don't really do those. We just sign the thing.
val Are you really this lazy?
darryl_philbin I'll be there.
gabe_lewis Hey.
val Hey.
gabe_lewis Monday's suck.
val Yeaha...yup. Just trying to get in.
dwight_schrute I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
andy_bernard What do you got?
dwight_schrute Allow me. You're going to love this. Ugh...should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
andy_bernard Sounds controversial.
dwight_schrute Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
andy_bernard Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
dwight_schrute Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
andy_bernard Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
dwight_schrute I will do my voodoo.
andy_bernard Mmhmmm.
gabe_lewis Hey. I need you to get the paperwork rolling on a new workplace relationship.
toby_flenderson For you?
gabe_lewis Yes. For Gabe.
toby_flenderson Who are you seeing? That's gr...
gabe_lewis Whom I'm seeing is Val from down in the warehouse.
toby_flenderson Oh.
gabe_lewis I'm not technically seeing her, but uh I've seen her, with the eyes and uh there was attraction. In at least one direction. So..
toby_flenderson You know I don't have to do the paperwork unless you're actually dating.
gabe_lewis Ok, but once this starts, it's going to be moving fast. It's going to be hot and heavy and I don't want a bunch of bureaucratic red tape wrapped around my jock. You know?
toby_flenderson But I mean...uh have you talked to her? Is sh...
gabe_lewis Yeah we had a whole conversation about Mondays...
toby_flenderson Do you know her last name, yet?
gabe_lewis Toby I'm going to tell you her last name tomorrow because she's going to be screaming it tonight.
toby_flenderson She's going to be screaming her own last name?
gabe_lewis Hey! Watch it.
toby_flenderson Good luck Gabe.
andy_bernard Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.
kevin_malone Thank you.
andy_bernard And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call...Dwight...
dwight_schrute The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
andy_bernard If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
dwight_schrute Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
kelly_kapoor What emails are you talking about?
dwight_schrute Robert's favorite songs Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.
kelly_kapoor That's not that bad actually.
dwight_schrute P.S. We should should kill him.
jim_halpert Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
dwight_schrute No, it's an accountability booster.
jim_halpert Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
dwight_schrute Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
kelly_kapoor Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
ryan_howard We can't do this Dwight.
dwight_schrute Smile...nod. Smile and nod.
dwight_schrute They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like...not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor...
andy_bernard Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
dwight_schrute But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
andy_bernard Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.
stanley_hudson This doomsdays device sounds like a scare tactic to me.
oscar_martinez There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
dwight_schrute Oh, there's one mistake.
erin_hannon Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
andy_bernard Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I...
dwight_schrute It's not a doomsday device, gosh. We can do this you guys.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode06 Crew First. Second.
darryl_philbin It's not a race.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode06 Crew Thirrrr....third.
darryl_philbin Who knows what the belt is for?
gabe_lewis It's for protecting my ass. When you suckers lift more than you can handle. Sup, I'm Gabe. Corporate. Continue. Don't be nervous.
darryl_philbin Apparently we have a visitor. Gabe, everyone.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode06 Crew Hi, gabe.
darryl_philbin All right so the support belt. Now this one is mine. Doesn't get much use nowadays.
gabe_lewis Look at this, this is enormous.
gabe_lewis I get the sense that Val enjoys a good putdown. Considering that's the only thing I know about her. I will be milking that hard.
gabe_lewis It's like a hula hoop. Right. Mele Kalikimaka is the wise way.
darryl_philbin You done?
gabe_lewis The Michelin man called, he wants his cummerbund back.
phyllis_vance Remember we have to give Rigo Escrow their refund by five.
kevin_malone I'm on it.
angela_martin Kevin, maybe I should handle that. We really need you to focus on your project.
kevin_malone Good thinking.
kevin_malone Apparently a big client for this company, needs to know the story of how paper gets made.
angela_martin Oscar, use a calculator.
oscar_martinez When the stakes are this high, there is only one computer that I trust. And it's powered by thai food and spanish reds.
andy_bernard Alright everybody, you are doing great!
dwight_schrute Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work.
jim_halpert Dwight, question.
dwight_schrute No questions.
jim_halpert If this doomsday device goes off...
dwight_schrute Accountability booster.
jim_halpert If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
dwight_schrute I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
stanley_hudson Try mose1234.
ryan_howard Dwight would never be that obvious. Try something like...z64$8. Not that exactly Jim, something like that.
jim_halpert Ok.
dwight_schrute How about Scrantonstrangler666.
jim_halpert Nope.
dwight_schrute No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha...You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
kelly_kapoor Wha...what's Dwight's mothers name.
jim_halpert Hmm...Heda. No.
darryl_philbin Once you read the packet, sign the back.
gabe_lewis Hey Darryl, I was thinking, uh, maybe while we read through this, uh, you could grab us all some coffee. My treat. It's a hundred dollar bill. Should cover it I think. Don't bring me any of that caramel soy latte crap, ok? I want a decaf frappuccino. Val...
darryl_philbin Actually, Val, why don't you come with? I'll need the extra hands to carry them back.
val Yeah, sure.
gabe_lewis Uh.
darryl_philbin Mmhmm. Caramel soy latte.
gabe_lewis Decaf frap-
darryl_philbin Got it.
angela_martin You sent the late notice to Ryan Heart & Wolf. Right?
oscar_martinez Mhm. Six-forty, six-twenty.
angela_martin Six-seventy, six-twenty.
oscar_martinez Nuh uh.
angela_martin yes!
oscar_martinez Five eighty-eight plus fifteen percent- Oh no.
kevin_malone What does this mean? What does it mean!
oscar_martinez Andy.
angela_martin Ohhhh!
andy_bernard Gahhh. That's five strikes.
stanley_hudson Well...I was saving this for my retirement, which I guess is today.
andy_bernard Dwight we got five strikes.
dwight_schrute Really?
andy_bernard Did the email go out or...
dwight_schrute It goes out automatically at five P.M.
andy_bernard Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
dwight_schrute Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
andy_bernard Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
dwight_schrute No.
andy_bernard What?!
dwight_schrute You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
phyllis_vance We did our best.
dwight_schrute No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. What?!
erin_hannon You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
dwight_schrute Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
kevin_malone Uh, the man tree puts its penis-
dwight_schrute Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
andy_bernard Nn no.
dwight_schrute What?
andy_bernard No!
oscar_martinez Dwight be human for once. Shut down the machine.
kelly_kapoor Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! Shut it down! Shut it down!
dwight_schrute Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
erin_hannon Dwight's car is gone.
pam_beesly I bet he went home.
andy_bernard Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.
andy_bernard Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.
kevin_malone Yeah.
andy_bernard Kevin has that lovability.
kevin_malone Guys come on. I'm right here.
andy_bernard Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.
jim_halpert Ok, where is he?
erin_hannon Uh, he's at some club where you either eat squash or play squash.
jim_halpert I'll try both.
dwight_schrute Oh. Come to reason with me?
andy_bernard Gotcha something. And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
dwight_schrute Get lost.
andy_bernard Well now hold on it, it-
pam_beesly What are you doing?
dwight_schrute What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
pam_beesly Uhm.
erin_hannon Do you need a hand?
pam_beesly Yeah, do you need a hand?
dwight_schrute If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
robert_california I'll see you next week Will.
jim_halpert Robert.
robert_california Jim what are you...What a surprise.
jim_halpert Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
robert_california Yeah.
jim_halpert You up for a game?
robert_california A game or a match?

pam_beesly Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
dwight_schrute Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
pam_beesly Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
dwight_schrute This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
val That's too much Doodle and not enough Lab.
darryl_philbin Yeah, when are they gonna do a Labradoodle that's just Lab?
val That's what I'm sayin'.
gabe_lewis Hey. You're welcome.

gabe_lewis So, tonight I was thinking, I'm gonna go to the cemetery. I'm gonna drink a little wine and I thought maybe you'd like to come with me.
val Are you asking me on a date?
gabe_lewis Yes, I am.
val Because I don't date coworkers. It's not personal, it's a matter of policy.

angela_martin Oh, now you can do math? Where were you 2 hours ago 'A Beautiful Mind'-
oscar_martinez I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
stanley_hudson I know how to save the company, everyone. Just write a petition, get everyones' signature, including our clients, march down to Florida, and shove it up your butt! Ha!
oscar_martinez It's not that funny.
erin_hannon Oh, Pam. You got something on your shirt.
pam_beesly Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?
dwight_schrute Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's "Nobody's perfect." Nice stroke, Pam.
pam_beesly No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
dwight_schrute I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
andy_bernard Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
pam_beesly You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
dwight_schrute Any specific animal?

dwight_schrute Don't say cow- Ugh.

robert_california Yeah.
jim_halpert What kinda iPhone is that?
robert_california It's the standard one. The one everyone has.
jim_halpert Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
robert_california It depends Jim. Do you find one-day only Jet Blue sales to Buffalo interesting?
jim_halpert Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-
robert_california My serve!
pam_beesly Dwight stopped the device!
andy_bernard Oh!
kevin_malone Yes!
erin_hannon Haho!
oscar_martinez He stopped it!
ryan_howard Oh! We still have our jobs.
dwight_schrute They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
robert_california Take it easy. Nice and easy.
jim_halpert Ah! Classic, right?
