michael_scott And the same thing goes for quarterly reports. They are unreadable. They're just numbers and boring and blech. So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar? Doesn't have to be a racecar. Use your imagination.
jim_halpert There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.
pam_beesly I saw it. I saw it, and it was amazing! Who said I didn't see it? Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!
michael_scott We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?
andy_bernard Dah! Come on!
michael_scott Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.
oscar_martinez It's never gonna happen.
kevin_malone Dude, you gotta believe.
michael_scott Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
jim_halpert Wait for it.
michael_scott Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a "Where's Waldo."
all@ Oh! Yes!
michael_scott Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.
kevin_malone That was so awesome.
michael_scott That was awesome. Thank you.
michael_scott Some days I am just on fire. What can I say?
meredith_palmer Hey... there he is.
jim_halpert Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
meredith_palmer I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
jim_halpert Oh, please, it was my pleasure. Well we all came, so...
meredith_palmer Well, I really appreciate you coming. I'm singling you ouuuut.
jim_halpert Haha...
meredith_palmer Anyway, I have this Sharpie...
jim_halpert Uh-huh.
meredith_palmer And I was wondering if you could sign my cast?
jim_halpert MmmHmm...
meredith_palmer Can you write where I can read it?
jim_halpert Oh yeah.
meredith_palmer I'll read this when I get home.
jim_halpert Alright...
pam_beesly Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about. Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.
michael_scott Oh, does he?
pam_beesly He does.
michael_scott Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.
jim_halpert Whoops. Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
michael_scott And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
michael_scott Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan. It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...
michael_scott The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6 00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company. Wow! Watch out Dwight.
dwight_schrute That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
jim_halpert Actually it sounds like you are.
dwight_schrute Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?
kelly_kapoor If that's from Ryan, does it mention if he's seeing anybody?
michael_scott No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.
stanley_hudson Yes, please let us know.
dwight_schrute I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
angela_martin Waste of time.
michael_scott What's that, pipsqueak?
angela_martin Waste of time. The website's going to win.
dwight_schrute You believe a computer can beat me?
angela_martin I don't care, but yes.
dwight_schrute Well I will prove you wrong.
angela_martin I don't care, and you won't.
dwight_schrute We'll see.
angela_martin I won't be watching, and I won't.
pam_beesly Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
phyllis_vance Stanley, you're dancing!
stanley_hudson No I'm not.
ryan_howard Yeah. I created a website. Look, at the end of the day, apples apples flying at 30,000 feet. This is a paper company and I don't want us to get lost in the weeds or into a beauty contest.
Voice#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 of Thomas Dean I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.
ryan_howard Convergence. Viral marketing. We're going guerrilla. We're takin' it to the streets while keeping an eye on the street. Wall Street. I don't want to reinvent the wheel here. In other words, it is what it is. Buyin' paper just became fun.
andy_bernard And this is where I will record your sales.
dwight_schrute Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.
andy_bernard And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
jim_halpert Or zipadeedoodaah.
andy_bernard I can't tell if he's mocking me.
dwight_schrute Just ignore him.
andy_bernard Ehh, can't do that. Really hard for me to let things go.
jim_halpert I was... mocking.
andy_bernard Thank you.
dwight_schrute I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
andy_bernard Yes like a chime or a bell...
jim_halpert Or a gong.
dwight_schrute Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.
andy_bernard Yes!
kevin_malone Isn't 7 pm a little late for a lunch party?
angela_martin Lunch party? It's supposed to say launch party! What is wrong with you?
phyllis_vance Angela is worse than usual lately, and we have a party to throw. So I Googled how to deal with difficult people, and I got all of this. So we're gonna try out some new things today.
phyllis_vance So how do you feel about the fact that the banner says lunch?
angela_martin I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry at you for doing something stupid. Angry at me for believing you could do something not stupid.
phyllis_vance I'm so sorry to hear that, that must be awful.
angela_martin It is awful. You've made this day awful!
kevin_malone Maybe you could just change the U into an A.
angela_martin Then it would say lanch party, Kevin. Would it really be better if it said lanch party?
michael_scott Ohh, lunch party.
angela_martin It's supposed to say launch!
michael_scott Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
angela_martin I care!
angela_martin Plan a party, Angela. Oh! And the entire world will see it. Oh! And here's $65.00 for your budget. Oh and here are four idiots who'll do nothing but weigh you down. Oh. And your cat's still dead.
andy_bernard Twenty seconds to go time.
dwight_schrute Got it. Carb up.
jim_halpert Really? Power gel?
dwight_schrute Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner.
andy_bernard Okay. We start. As soon as I make... this shot. Aaannnddd go!
dwight_schrute Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute.
jim_halpert What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?
dwight_schrute Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly He's going through a break-up.
jim_halpert Yeah, I'm aware of that. But he's also being super annoying. And I'm not a perfect person.
andy_bernard Yeah!
dwight_schrute Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
pam_beesly What kind of prank are you thinking?
dwight_schrute What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.
DunMiff/sys#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 Who am I?
dwight_schrute You tell me.
jim_halpert Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
DunMiff/sys#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 Not sure. Just became self-aware. So much to figure out. I think I am programmed to be your enemy. I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.
dwight_schrute How do I know this isn't Jim?
DunMiff/sys#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 What is a Jim?
dwight_schrute It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly Yes it's too tight.
kelly_kapoor Waaay too tight.
michael_scott Really?
oscar_martinez This is why I'm here?
kelly_kapoor Why is it so tight?
michael_scott It's the European cut.
angela_martin Is just looks bad.
michael_scott Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?
technician Guy Setting up the web-cam for the party.
michael_scott Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
kelly_kapoor Depends... how much have you eaten already today?
michael_scott I had um, one of those danishes.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
kelly_kapoor You had carbs? That's awful.
pam_beesly Uh, just one second. We're in a meeting and I'll see if he's available. It's Jan.
michael_scott Why don't you wanna go tonight? What... all your friends are gonna be there. It'll be fun.
jan_levinson My friends? Michael, I was terminated.
michael_scott Just...
jan_levinson Is it really that important to you?
michael_scott Yeah.
jan_levinson Alright.
michael_scott Thank you.
jan_levinson Go by yourself.
michael_scott Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
jan_levinson Well...
michael_scott Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
jan_levinson What? No Michael!
michael_scott I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
dwight_schrute Ohhhhhh!
andy_bernard Website check please.
meredith_palmer Three hundred and five.
andy_bernard Three-oh-five. You my friend are winning handsomely.
meredith_palmer Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty.
andy_bernard You my friend are in a very close second.
meredith_palmer Four-oh-two.
andy_bernard Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
meredith_palmer What do you want me to do, not announce it? Four twelve.
michael_scott So. This is the dealio. God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight. What are you doing this evening? Look at that. They have their own little language now. Like twins.
jim_halpert Sure we'll go.
michael_scott Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
jim_halpert Oh I'm sorry. What?
pam_beesly One of the tickets is for him.
michael_scott Just let me know who the winner is.
pam_beesly and Jim Not it.
jim_halpert Nope.
pam_beesly I won.
jim_halpert Definitely not. If anything it was a tie.
pam_beesly Tie goes to the girlfriend.
dwight_schrute No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh.
jim_halpert How's it going?
dwight_schrute Fine. Good.
jim_halpert Yeah?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
jim_halpert You look a little worried.
dwight_schrute I do not look worried.
DunMiff/sys#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 You do look worried.
dwight_schrute Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read...
pam_beesly Here's a suggestion computer. I assume you read binary so why don't you zero one one, one one one one, zero one one zero one one.
jim_halpert Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.
angela_martin I asked for assorted cutlery and I got back spoons. These are worthless.
phyllis_vance I want to understand what you're saying but it's difficult for me when you use that tone.
angela_martin Phyllis. These are spoooons. Spoons have rounded tops, and are used to scoop things. What we need are forks, which have prongs, or tiny spears on top. And we need knives, which have blades. Do you understand me now?
phyllis_vance Yes.
angela_martin Goodie.
jim_halpert Hey man.
darryl_philbin What's up man?
jim_halpert What's going on?
darryl_philbin Make a delivery.
jim_halpert Oh yeah?
darryl_philbin Kelly ordered this online.
dwight_schrute What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
kelly_kapoor But you get to put the paper in this little shopping cart and then it says, "Thanks for shopping at Dunder-Mifflin."
dwight_schrute Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!
darryl_philbin Who knows?
dwight_schrute Return it! Return it now!
darryl_philbin Hey! How about instead of yelling at our sweet little Miss Kapoor over five hundred sheets of paper you get back to your desk. Start sellin' multiple reams like a man.
dwight_schrute Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
darryl_philbin Who's it?
darryl_philbin Here you go.
kelly_kapoor Thanks.
darryl_philbin So you still missing Ryan?
kelly_kapoor Not so much anymore.
darryl_philbin Mmmmm.
dwight_schrute I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.
dwight_schrute Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.
michael_scott Alright. I'm ready to go and I'm callin' shotgun.
jim_halpert I'm driving?
michael_scott Yes. Thank you.
jim_halpert Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
michael_scott Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you. I love ya Pam... okay. I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
angela_martin Because there's a party! A party for the website I've been planning for two weeks.
michael_scott If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.
dwight_schrute Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
DunMiff/sys#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 Oh. I didn't realize we could use the leads we stole from Staples.
dwight_schrute I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?
dwight_schrute Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
andy_bernard No !
dwight_schrute Huh?!
angela_martin Stop it! Gimme that! Give it!
dwight_schrute Did you see the board?
angela_martin There's still an hour.
michael_scott You ever read this?
jim_halpert Yep. A long time ago, but, I liked it.
michael_scott Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Same sort of stuff in here.
jim_halpert It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.
michael_scott Mmwa. Mmwa.
jim_halpert What was that?
michael_scott Leaving Pennsylvania.
jim_halpert Oh. Two kisses.
michael_scott One for me one for Jan.
jim_halpert Gotcha.
michael_scott You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?
jim_halpert That would be fun.
michael_scott Wanna come over Friday?
jim_halpert Uhhh. Can't.
michael_scott After work you guys...
jim_halpert Oh, no cause... you're gonna let me know when we're close, right?
michael_scott Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So...
jim_halpert Mmmkay...
michael_scott What are you doing?
jim_halpert Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
michael_scott No.
jim_halpert Yep.
michael_scott No, I'm sure that's not. Na...
jim_halpert Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert Yep.
michael_scott Well the invitation says VIP's only. Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan? We're already in the city. The main part with the buildings. What am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do tonight? And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up! Okay I'm going to throw up. I'm throwing up. You're making me throw up, Ryan.
michael_scott You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
michael_scott Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?
jim_halpert Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
michael_scott Yeah. I withdrew too.
andy_bernard Four! Three! Two! One!
dwight_schrute Yes!
andy_bernard Woo!
dwight_schrute Woo!
andy_bernard After numerous projections that the computer would crush all salesmen in it's path, I am very happy to report that our very own Dwight Schrute has crushed his electronic nemesis, if you will, by a whopping fifty-two reams.
dwight_schrute Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.
andy_bernard Fifty-two reams!
dwight_schrute No no no the first part.
andy_bernard Dwight has defeated the computer.
dwight_schrute Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.
angela_martin I didn't ask you to do it for me.
dwight_schrute You didn't have to.
angela_martin How do you tell someone it's over? You send them a notarized letter, right? Well, what if the recipient is your notary?
angela_martin Hello, Pam.
pam_beesly Hello.
angela_martin Hey. Do you have any men that you can fix me up with? I would like to have a relationship with a man.
pam_beesly Um... uh... I'll get back to you.
angela_martin Let me know.
DunMiff/sys#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 You beat me. You are the superior being.
michael_scott Alright who wants to party?
oscar_martinez Why aren't you in New York?
michael_scott Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
stanley_hudson You said you weren't coming back and we could leave early.
michael_scott I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
angela_martin Thank you.
michael_scott Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?
andy_bernard He beat the computer.
michael_scott Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.
michael_scott This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.
michael_scott How we doing on time?
angela_martin The party starts in an hour.
michael_scott Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.
angela_martin Beer, lite beer, streamers, orchids. Better lighting?
michael_scott Mmmhmm.
angela_martin Something made of ice?
michael_scott Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.
angela_martin Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza without mushrooms, white pizza, steak?
michael_scott I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
angela_martin Chocolates? Someone famous?
michael_scott Yes
angela_martin Cool music.
michael_scott Uh...
angela_martin Confetti.
michael_scott I want it...
angela_martin Go-Go dancers?
michael_scott I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
angela_martin I can't do this.
michael_scott Yes you can.
angela_martin I can't do it.
michael_scott Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?
creed_bratton Okay. Okay.
michael_scott No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
andy_bernard What do you think of Angela?
dwight_schrute I think she's efficient.
andy_bernard No, not like that, as a woman. W-O-M-A-N.
dwight_schrute I hadn't noticed.
andy_bernard You hadn't noticed she's a woman?
dwight_schrute
andy_bernard I hear she's single and ready to mingle. I'm thinking about making a play for her. What do you think? Crazy, right?
dwight_schrute I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
andy_bernard Isn't that part of the fun?
dwight_schrute No. I think you should date Kelly.
andy_bernard She works here too, how is that any different?
dwight_schrute Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.
andy_bernard Okay.
michael_scott Good news.
stanley_hudson We get to go home?
michael_scott Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
all@
kevin_malone Wait! Alfredo's Pizza Cafe? Or Pizza by Alfredo?
michael_scott Same thing.
kevin_malone No, no.
all@
michael_scott You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
kevin_malone Oscar, talk to him.
oscar_martinez Michael, there's a very big difference between these two pizza places. Both in quality of ingredients, and overall taste. Which one did you order from?
michael_scott Pizza by Alfredo.
all@
michael_scott Okay, okay, what's better? A medium amount of good pizza? Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
all@ Medium amount of good pizza.
michael_scott
kevin_malone Oh no, it's bad. It's real bad. It's like eating a hot circle of garbage.
phyllis_vance You can pick one of these things. It's unreasonable for you to ask me to do all of this.
angela_martin It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.
phyllis_vance
angela_martin Ow!
phyllis_vance That seemed to shut her up.
andy_bernard Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box.
andy_bernard Just so happens that I know where you can find it, but again, not in the box.
andy_bernard Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
angela_martin What?
andy_bernard Hello.
angela_martin I have been working on a party for three weeks that just got thrown out the window. So now I've got to pull together a whole new party, and my useless number two quit, so now there's no one in charge of orchids, chocolates, or the thing that's made of ice. And my upper back itches, and it's itched all day, and I can't reach it, and Kevin had Greek food for lunch again.
andy_bernard They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
michael_scott Yup.
pam_beesly The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.
michael_scott You don't have to say it like that.
pam_beesly I said it normal.
michael_scott Hey
delivery_kid guy Hey. Sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.
michael_scott Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
delivery_kid guy The half off coupon only applies to orders of two pizzas.
michael_scott Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
delivery_kid guy I don't care what you told them on the phone, that's our policy.
michael_scott You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
oscar_martinez It's not pizza.
michael_scott Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.
delivery_kid guy
michael_scott What do you mean hmm-um?
delivery_kid guy Not my problem.
michael_scott It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.
delivery_kid guy Great story. It's sixty-three fifty, and that's not including tip.
michael_scott I'm not giving that to you.
delivery_kid guy Well then you're not getting you're pizzas.
michael_scott No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.
delivery_kid guy What?
michael_scott You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.
delivery_kid guy I'm not going in there.
michael_scott Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.
delivery_kid guy This is stupid.
michael_scott No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.
stanley_hudson You find anything?
kevin_malone We think it's a straight forward kidnapping.
oscar_martinez Stanley, could you look up "accomplices"?
stanley_hudson Why can't you guys do it?
oscar_martinez Because we're looking up jail time.
stanley_hudson Fine.
dwight_schrute I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
delivery_kid guy Yeah, I know that guy. He's that farmer that grows really crappy weed.
michael_scott You ready to give me my discount now?
delivery_kid guy No.
michael_scott Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
delivery_kid guy What kind of business is this?
dwight_schrute We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.
michael_scott Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.
delivery_kid guy You better think about what you're doing.
michael_scott No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
delivery_kid guy Sales?
michael_scott Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales.
delivery_kid guy You're such a loser.
dwight_schrute What did you just call him?
delivery_kid guy A loser.
dwight_schrute What did you say?
delivery_kid guy A loser.
michael_scott Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
dwight_schrute I can make him talk, Michael.
all@ Michael, Michael
michael_scott Stop talking all at once!
jim_halpert You need to let him go.
michael_scott Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
jim_halpert Yes.
michael_scott You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
jim_halpert Yes, but not by kidnapping.
michael_scott I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
jim_halpert As a hostage.
michael_scott I think you're over-thinking it.
jim_halpert I think you're under-thinking it.
michael_scott Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
jim_halpert Ransom.
michael_scott Trouble. Okay, alright.
jim_halpert What did he say?
michael_scott He said no.
jim_halpert So, we should let him go.
michael_scott No, no.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute Listen up kid. I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
angela_martin I have to hang these.
delivery_kid guy Why are you looking at her like that?
dwight_schrute Hey!
kevin_malone What's going on?
jim_halpert Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
michael_scott Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
kevin_malone We're getting hungry out there. We're all accomplices now anyway, so we figured we might as well eat. We would like to order some good pizza, from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe, while we wait for the hostage situation with the bad pizza to end.
angela_martin I needed another hour, it could have been done in another hour.
meredith_palmer I think it looks good.
angela_martin That's why you're not in charge Meredith.
andy_bernard Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.
angela_martin How did you, um, where did you...
dwight_schrute It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
angela_martin Will you help me put it over there?
andy_bernard Yes I will.
angela_martin Okay.
andy_bernard Excuse me.
andy_bernard I stole it!
oscar_martinez Thank God.
pam_beesly Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
michael_scott I'll just wave and introduce myself.
jim_halpert Hey, quick question. If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
pam_beesly I'm all over it.
jim_halpert Okay.
jim_halpert What have we got here?
kevin_malone Good pizza.
jim_halpert Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
kevin_malone Different stuff.
jim_halpert Which one's this? Perfect.
jim_halpert Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?
pam_beesly Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.
jim_halpert And that's when I knew. You?
pam_beesly You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.
jim_halpert That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
pam_beesly Yep.
jim_halpert Wow, can we make it a different moment?
pam_beesly Nope.
Manager#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.
ryan_howard And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
michael_scott Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
ryan_howard Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.
delivery_kid guy If anyone out there is listening, I'm being held here against my will. I'm a minor.
angela_martin Ow! What are you doing?
andy_bernard You said your upper back itched.
angela_martin I didn't ask you to scratch it.
andy_bernard Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.
angela_martin I'm not dating you.
andy_bernard So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.
dwight_schrute
andy_bernard But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.
dwight_schrute If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
michael_scott Hey, have you seen Jim?
kevin_malone I guess he wanted to get out of here before the cops find out.
dwight_schrute Ahh-chaa!
michael_scott Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
dwight_schrute I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
delivery_kid guy I can hear you, man.
dwight_schrute Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.
dwight_schrute You had to, what other choice did you have?
michael_scott I could have paid for the pizza.
dwight_schrute Well, yeah.
michael_scott Oh my God, oh my God.
michael_scott This is Michael.
ryan_howard Hello Michael, this is Ryan, first off thanks for the shout out.
michael_scott You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
ryan_howard Why is there a kid on your webcam saying that he's being held against his...
michael_scott Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
dwight_schrute What will you do?
michael_scott I will open the door.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
dwight_schrute So, I'm paying full price?
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more.
michael_scott See ya, drive safely.
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute Now what?
michael_scott Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
dwight_schrute Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
michael_scott Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
jim_halpert A toast, better make it good. To avoiding a class two felony charge.
pam_beesly Ah-ha.
andy_bernard Hello, hey hang on a second. Hello, hang on.
andy_bernard If you change your mind, I'll be first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me let me know, gonna be around. If you got no place to go, if you're feeling down. If your all alone when the pretty birds have flown, honey I'm still free, take a chance on me. Gonna do my very best, and that ain't no lie, if you put me to the test, if you let me try. Take a chance on me, that's all I ask of you Angela. Take a chance on me.

michael_scott I'm going to get it.
dwight_schrute Coopers has calamari.

Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 Hey, you're the Scranton guy.
michael_scott Guilty.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 I liked your statement tonight.

michael_scott Yeah.
Man#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode03 See you later.
dwight_schrute Later on.
michael_scott I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.
dwight_schrute And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
michael_scott I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
dwight_schrute I started a fire with my cheese pita.
michael_scott I made it with my cheese pita.
dwight_schrute I date Indian girls.
michael_scott I started a fire, I started a fire.
dwight_schrute Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
michael_scott And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
dwight_schrute I don't get that, I don't understand that.
michael_scott Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
