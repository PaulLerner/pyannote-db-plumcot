nellie_bertram Have you seen Darryl?
erin_hannon He's around here somewhere.
nellie_bertram Mmm.
erin_hannon Yeah, Darryl's here. So is Santa Claus. It's just a regular Thursday. Neither guy is here. And, it's Friday. Welcome to me and Darryl's world of lies.
erin_hannon Nobody knows it yet, but Darryl already started working in Philly. So now, he has to sneak out of here like the sneakiest little sneaky-sneak you ever saw. And I'm his helper. It's so fun.
erin_hannon Darryl. Meet... bear... ull.
darryl_philbin How much did you pay for that?
erin_hannon Nothing. Won him at the carnival. Spent a ton on tickets, though. Drive safe.
darryl_philbin Everybody knows I go to Philly. I've just been using sick days I saved up. But, Erin was so excited about being sneaky-sneaks, I went along with it.
erin_hannon Ha, ha, ha! Darryl, you are too much! That guy's hilarious. He's here today.
pam_beesly I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... Oh my god! Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? Huh? No way. No way!
angela_martin Excuse me, everyone. Is it OK if I leave early from work today? It's Phillip's first birthday and the senator and I are hosting a party at our house.
erin_hannon Aw, cute! So there'll be a bunch of kids.
angela_martin No. No children. Our house is not kid-friendly. Most of our furniture is sharp. Also, ew. It will mostly be campaign donors.
kevin_malone Angela, I am prepared to donate a whopping... 8 dollars to Lipton For America to have an invitation...
angela_martin No, no, please. You know, actually, none of you could even really make the cut for this thing. Which I am so sad about.
oscar_martinez Angela. You're going to find out, so I thought I'd let you know that, uh, Robert invited me too.
angela_martin What?
oscar_martinez He said he wanted me there for support.
angela_martin I'm his! His... wife.
oscar_martinez Angela's husband and I are in love. But, as a politician in this town, you still need the conventional blonde wife on your lawn signs. He is risking everything to have me there today. Me.
angela_martin We agreed that you wouldn't be seen with him in public. It's humiliating for me. Well, if you get to bring a stud, maybe I do too.
jim_halpert Hey.
darryl_philbin Hey.
jim_halpert We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.
darryl_philbin Just a couple of grown, sexy-ass roommates.
jim_halpert And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
darryl_philbin Jim was nice enough to give me his bedroom.
jim_halpert I'm couching it!
darryl_philbin Which usually means there's clothes all over the living room.
jim_halpert And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
darryl_philbin I love Jim. I love that he hooked me up with a job. It's just, he uses old t-shirts as wash rags. He doesn't wash his dishes. Apparently, they need to soak... He hooked me up with a job.
pam_beesly Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.
pam_beesly I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.
jim_halpert Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.
darryl_philbin Already on it. I ordered them by their Google trend ranking so we know who to hit first.
jim_halpert Who is this guy? We are killing it.
darryl_philbin Yes sir.
jim_halpert Yeah!
pam_beesly Conference room. Everybody. Now!
dwight_schrute You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
pam_beesly Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
dwight_schrute You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
pam_beesly Yeah.
dwight_schrute Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
pam_beesly I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.
erin_hannon I thought that's what you were doing.
pam_beesly Yeah, but this is different.
erin_hannon Oh. They used worse paint than your paint?
pam_beesly I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...
erin_hannon I thought you wanted paint on the whole thing.
pam_beesly Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.
meredith_palmer Yeah, and somebody had the balls to put my phone number on the men's room wall. Which is so messed up. It's 6782 not 83.
creed_bratton Uh, 6783's also a good time. Less mileage.
oscar_martinez Pam, what can be done?
pam_beesly Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.
oscar_martinez I was politely saying nothing can be done. I thought I was clear.
pam_beesly What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.
phyllis_vance David Wallace called this meeting?
pam_beesly Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.
pam_beesly No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
dwight_schrute Pam, I'll help you.
pam_beesly You will?
dwight_schrute If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
pam_beesly Thank you.
nellie_bertram I am in too, Pam.
pam_beesly Yeah?
nellie_bertram Yes, of course. I believe in you. I believe in your art. And I am bored.
pam_beesly Great.
pam_beesly I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
dwight_schrute You need my pitchfork?
angela_martin Hey!
dwight_schrute What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
angela_martin Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
dwight_schrute Ah, I'm not interested.
angela_martin What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
dwight_schrute If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.
kevin_malone Hey. So, a little birdie just told me that Dwight can't come to your son's birthday. So, do you want me to go with you?
angela_martin No.
kevin_malone OK. I understand. I'll just stay here, then. Alone with the money.
angela_martin Aw, crap.
dwight_schrute I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
frank You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there.
dwight_schrute Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
colin_athlead_employee I'm not drawing a butt.
nellie_bertram All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
dwight_schrute Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
val OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
dwight_schrute Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
nellie_bertram Well, this is getting us nowhere.
pam_beesly We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
dwight_schrute We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. Nate. Your mother is dying.
pam_beesly See, I feel bad about that.
dwight_schrute It's all right. It's all right.
nate So, she's gonna pull through again? That's great. Can I talk to her?
dwight_schrute No. She needs her rest again.
nellie_bertram Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
dwight_schrute You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
nate Gum's gotten mintier lately. Have you noticed? Like, some of it's just too minty. It's like they're literally trying to hurt...
pam_beesly Tell us who defaced the mural!
nate He did it.
pam_beesly All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
dwight_schrute There's no gum. There never was any gum.
nate That's really rude.
kevin_malone Opening with pub pastries? That's a bold play. They're saying, it's only gonna get better from here? Good luck.
oscar_martinez That painting is just... How can anyone that weighs less than a guinea hen be so terrifying?
stanley_hudson Announcer Ladies and gentlemen, Senator and Angela Lipton.
state_senator_rob_lipton Thanks, everybody. Thanks for coming. Phillip had no idea he was so popular.
angela_martin Oh, Robert, you're horrible. Simon, Maxine. Who let you guys in here?
athlead_employee Employee This is the team.
jim_halpert Nice job, man.
darryl_philbin You too... Darryl.
jim_halpert What? Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
darryl_philbin It's cool. Reading's tricky sometimes.
jim_halpert Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
darryl_philbin That's my go-to thermos. That's all.
jim_halpert Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
darryl_philbin No big deal. No big deal.
jim_halpert No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.
darryl_philbin Nah, nah...
jim_halpert No big deal.
darryl_philbin Nah, nah, nah. You don't have to do that.
jim_halpert Honestly, I don't mind. Did you want me to wash it for you or...
darryl_philbin I don't know. You gonna wash it? Or you gonna let it soak?
jim_halpert OK. Here ya go.
darryl_philbin Thank you.
nellie_bertram So, Frank. Do you have any thoughts about what was done? By you?
pam_beesly Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.
toby_flenderson You sort of deserve an apology here. Frank?
frank I'm sorry I didn't like your crappy doodles. I drew a butt. Big deal. Butts are funny.
pam_beesly Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.
frank Well, maybe if you got the stick out of yours.
pam_beesly What was that?
frank You know what? You people can't fire me. So, screw you.
pam_beesly Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?
toby_flenderson Uh... it... compliment...
nellie_bertram The first 'sorry' sounded sincere.
toby_flenderson There were two or three 'sorry's in there.
pam_beesly That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
dwight_schrute Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
pam_beesly We should just take him down.
dwight_schrute Wait. Are you saying...
pam_beesly I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
dwight_schrute Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
dwight_schrute He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
pam_beesly Yes!
dwight_schrute A little eye for an eye action.
pam_beesly Yes!
dwight_schrute Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
pam_beesly We need an infiltrator.
dwight_schrute I know just the man for the job.
pam_beesly Clark?
dwight_schrute He even looks like a mole.
oscar_martinez One of his tee shots can wipe out a whole owl population.
stanley_hudson Guest You two seem very close.
state_senator_rob_lipton Yes. We're good friends. Good friends.
oscar_martinez Yeah.
state_senator_rob_lipton You know, I suppose that may ruffle a few feathers. For a long time, our party has turned it's back on the Hispanic people. Well, that is not who I am. I am a friend of the Latino community. And if you ask me, it's time we bid bigotry hasta luego. Now, does my embrace of Hispanics make me more electable? Given demographic trends? I don't know. And I don't care. What I care about is Oscar. My friend. Mi amigo. Oscar.
oscar_martinez Maybe I should be insulted that he only invited me here to be his token Mexican friend. But, he could of invited any number of Hispanics that he knows. His gardener, Rogelio. Or he could've invited... Rogelio. But, he chose me. Rogelio's Malaysian... The son of a bitch is Malaysian.
darryl_philbin Oh, hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
darryl_philbin I usually watch TV during my lunch breaks. It's cool?
jim_halpert Yeah. Totally.
darryl_philbin All right.
jim_halpert It's mine. Don't worry.
darryl_philbin I didn't say anything.
jim_halpert I don't think you had to.
darryl_philbin Excuse me?
jim_halpert I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
darryl_philbin What you need flour for, Jim?
jim_halpert That's not the point.
darryl_philbin What? You making bread?
jim_halpert No, I'm not making bread.
darryl_philbin What kind of bread you making? Pumpernickel?
jim_halpert Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
darryl_philbin All right, I'm being a jerk. You got me this job. I should be grateful. I am, I just... you know, I get finicky about my stuff. That's all.
jim_halpert It's all good. Are we all good?
darryl_philbin We good.
jim_halpert What's that cooler?
darryl_philbin Nothing. It's mine. What happened to my Tavis Smileys?
jim_halpert Oh, crap. Were those yours?
dwight_schrute I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
clark Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
dwight_schrute Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
clark OK, boss. Pam, you know this is ridiculous, right? Like you're smarter than this.
pam_beesly Shh, shh.
clark This is never gonna work.
pam_beesly Shh. Remember your lines.
clark What lines?
dwight_schrute Go move some paper!
pam_beesly Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?
darryl_philbin He's not my hire, but I know who he is.
pam_beesly OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...
darryl_philbin What? Is he retiring? You getting him a gift or something?
pam_beesly Yeah, something like that.
darryl_philbin I know he loves his pick up truck.
pam_beesly Oh, great! His truck!
dwight_schrute Great. Get the plate number.
pam_beesly OK. Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
dwight_schrute So we know which truck to van...
darryl_philbin Hey. While I got you on the phone, your husband's like a sloppy, homeless hobo. Can you fix that?
pam_beesly Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. Come on.
stanley_hudson Photographer Hold on a second. Uh, Sandeep? Let's get you closer to the senator. Just about there. Great. And, Oscar? I'm gonna need you to step a little closer to the senator, as well. Somewhere there.
angela_martin He's blocking me.
state_senator_rob_lipton It's only a photo, honey.
stanley_hudson Photographer Excuse me, uh, what's your name?
stanley_hudson Waiter Sean.
stanley_hudson Photographer LaShawn. Great. You wanna be in a photo? Right this way. Not you. No.
oscar_martinez He put me here.
angela_martin He put you right in front of me?
stanley_hudson Photographer Let's just wheel Margaret right in front...
oscar_martinez Ow! Robert?!
state_senator_rob_lipton Angela.
stanley_hudson Photographer Smile.
pam_beesly I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
dwight_schrute Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
pam_beesly Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.
dwight_schrute Let's see yours.
pam_beesly Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
dwight_schrute This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
pam_beesly Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
dwight_schrute I saw that. That's great!
pam_beesly Yeah. I feel better.
dwight_schrute Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
pam_beesly I know. You miss Angela, don't you?
dwight_schrute Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his pen1s.
pam_beesly I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...
frank Lady! My truck? You had no right!
pam_beesly No, you had no right!
frank It's a $40,000 truck!
pam_beesly So? You started it!
frank So? So someone need to shut you up!
brian Hey, hey, hey!
pam_beesly Whoa.
brian Easy!
frank You son of a bitch!
brian You're gonna hit a woman?
state_senator_rob_lipton Thanks so much for coming. Thanks so much. Well. Have we all calmed down yet?
oscar_martinez Yes. Sorry about that.
angela_martin It was all my fault.
state_senator_rob_lipton Let's all try to do better next time. Kevin, great to see you.
kevin_malone Yeah. Thank you for the food. Oh, and also, you suck.
state_senator_rob_lipton I beg your pardon.
kevin_malone You are like a terrible person. These guys care about you and you're just using them. Again, the food was very good.
pam_beesly Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.
brian No. No, it's...
pam_beesly You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.
brian It's all good. I knew what I was doing. It's... I'm sorry about your mural, though. I mean, because you put so much into that.
pam_beesly Forget about my mural. It's stupid.
brian No. You, you worked hard on that. That guy's an animal. I'm glad they're firing him too.
pam_beesly It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.
brian Look. I don't, I don't wanna put myself where I don't belong. If you ever need me, you just call me. And I'll be there for you.
pam_beesly Thanks, Brian.
brian Seeya.
jim_halpert Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.
darryl_philbin Oh. Come on!
jim_halpert Oh. Oh!
darryl_philbin Damn!
jim_halpert You win. How good did that feel?
darryl_philbin That felt really good, actually.
