kevin Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
andy Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
jim Dave.
andy Cool.
jim You are? A cat?
andy We were looking for "kitten. "
jim Oh, hang on one second. jim Halpert.
pam Hey.
jim Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
pam Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention.
pam So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
dwight Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! Disappear.
michael Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
holly Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
michael When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
holly michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
michael Road trip! Right?
holly Breaker one-nine, copy?
michael Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
darryl Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
michael We're not.
holly Kidding.
michael We're not doing anything.
holly It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said "Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?" And he said "I asked you first. " And I said "First!" at the same time he did. And then I said "Jinx. " And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So.
michael All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
jim Oh, I'll walk you out.
michael Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
michael You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
jim All right. We'll see. No.
jim I am off to New York. My brother pete from Boston, and my brother tom from New Jersey are taking pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
dwight Good morning temp.
ryan 'Morning. Wow. Good morning Dwight.
dwight Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis?
andy Ha ha ha. That's funny. Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.
dwight Andy.
andy Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
dwight No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
andy Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
dwight Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
phyllis I'm sitting right here Dwight.
dwight I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
dwight Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes andy angry, so be it.
holly I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
michael Cool!
darryl Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
michael We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song. michael and
holly Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long. Michael, Holly, and
darryl If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way.
dwight Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
andy Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we. " You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
dwight Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
andy I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
dwight Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
pam Hey!
tom Hey, future baby sis!
pam How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
tom I'm good.
pam I asked tom and pete to come early so we could play a prank on jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, "That pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best. "
pam Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
pete That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
tom Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!
pete That, is awesome!
tom Like she basically has a hobby, for a job.
pete Oh yeah.
pam So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
pete I think this is better.
tom The other thing would "get" Jim.
pete This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!
pam Okay, okay.
tom Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends.
pam Oookay. .
pam They came up with that idea really fast.
darryl This trip was longer than I thought.
holly Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
michael Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
holly You were sleeping? You were talking before.
michael Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
darryl Not really.
michael All right. What's the scoop, how far?
darryl Four hours. Almost halfway there.
holly We're only halfway?
michael Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
darryl Next exit isn't for five miles.
holly Let's check there.
pam Hey guys.
jim Hey, how are you?
pam Hi!
jim Good to see you.
pete Nice to see you again, Pam.
tom Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long!
jim All right so now we can sit. and get comfortable.
darryl There's nothing out here man.
michael Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
michael Here we go, fourth time's a charm. "Life's like a road where you just. one day here, and the next day back. Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want. there's a world out there. . Hey. Are you crying?
holly No.
michael Allergies?
holly No.
michael Did darryl touch you?
darryl WHAT!?
holly No, darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please?
michael What's the matter?
holly It's not gonna work.
michael Sure it is.
holly There's too much distance.
michael Oh no no no. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
holly michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
michael Listen to me. I like you so much.
holly And I like you too.
michael And I've dated four women in the last--
holly I've dated four guys last year too.
michael Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
holly Oh.
michael I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
holly Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
michael That's what she said.
michael holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
andy Take that down.
dwight Excuse me?
andy Take. That down.
meredith You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
andy I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
creed It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
andy It's pronounced "Corn-ell!" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
dwight Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
andy Fine.
dwight What do you say?
andy Yeah, good. Can we--- Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!! . push;
holly If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at. midnight? At best?
michael Yeah.
holly And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
michael Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.
holly Oh.
michael I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
holly Well-
michael Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
holly How long could we keep that up?
michael Years!
holly Years?
michael Yeah.
holly Years? Of just a few hours every weekend?
michael Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
holly Thank you.
michael My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
darryl Clever, Mike.
tom So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?
pete Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
jim That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
tom Maybe pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.
jim Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
pete Hey, just having fun Jimmy.
tom Yeah. Right Pam?
pam Yup!
michael You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we. go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?
holly I do, I think so.
michael Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
darryl Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
michael I don't know what I'm gonna do!
darryl Please call me back.
michael Please?
holly You'll be okay
michael I'm not gonna be okay.
darryl Please.
holly You will.
michael No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
andy You might be interested-
stanley What?
andy Dwight!
dwight Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
andy Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
dwight That's a conflict of interest.
andy Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
dwight Interview.
andy Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
dwight What?
andy The conference room!
dwight Okay.
andy Who are your role models?
andy If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
andy So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.
jim Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
pam Cute.
jim That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
tom Yup. She only knows how to play "When the Saints go Marching In. "
jim Love that one.
pete Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
jim Here you go again! What is your deal today?
pete Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides. Louis Armstrong?
pam Miles Davis.
jim One.
pam Chet . something.
jim Half.
pete The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
pam Dizzy Gillespie.
jim Also good.
pete And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
tom You don't!
jim pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
pete I'm just calling it like I see it.
pam I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
jim Pam, don't worry about it.
pam I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So.
jim Guys, what is going on?!
tom We pranked you!
pete It was Pam's idea. pam was the mastermind.
pam . Got you.
pete That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
andy Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
dwight Bring it.
andy Who was Cornell's eighth president?
dwight Dale Raymond Corson!
andy Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. Comprehension skills, sub-par.
dwight Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.
andy What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
dwight On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
andy Nobody wants . that, to happen.
dwight Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
andy "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character. "
dwight "Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process. "
andy "Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations. "
dwight "Interviewer has suspect motives. "
andy "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid. "
dwight "Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth. " Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
andy I have everything I need-
dwight And you will be hearing from the -
andy And you will be hearing from -
dwight -Cornell Application Department,
andy which I will not be a part of-
dwight And you will not be pleased with the result.
andy And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
dwight And your affiliation with Cornell -
andy And your affiliation with Cornell -
dwight Will end completely!
andy Will end completely!
dwight That is all sir, you may go.
darryl There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
pam For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
jim Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
pam Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
jim That is good.
pam Thank you.
jim Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. Oh, text message from my brother. "pam cool. Welcome to the family. "
pam Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank tom about being bald?
darryl This is the last of it.
michael Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
darryl You're not staying?
michael You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.
darryl But you want me to put it back in the truck.
michael I'll be down in just a second. Holly?
michael So um. I think I'm gonna go back with darryl Okay. Goodbye.
holly Okay. Bye.
darryl I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
michael We didn't break up.
darryl Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
michael Okay.
darryl Da na na na na. da na na na na.
michael That's a really pretty song.
darryl Da na na na na. No, no, check it out, look. Da na na na na. want to do that?

michael Okay.
darryl Da na na na na.
michael Da na na na na.

michael Da na na na na.
darryl No, wait. You're, you're supposed to. Never mind. Da na na na na.

andy I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
dwight Where did you get those?
andy What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
dwight I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
andy Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
dwight Cornell.
