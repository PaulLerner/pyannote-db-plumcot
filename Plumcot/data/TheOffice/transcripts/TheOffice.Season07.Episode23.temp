deangelo So, coasting time is officially over. Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast. If you don't like 'em, this is called a door. You can walk right through it. Alright. I'm not here to be your friend. I like my life outside of this place. I live to leave at 5. Change number
one Darryl. Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night. Full ride. Deal with it.
darryl Seriously?
deangelo Stone cold seriously.
deangelo They are trying to figure me out. And I don't like it. Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear. And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader. Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care.
deangelo Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair.
toby Thanks.
deangelo Don't thank me! Hey, don't thank me, guy! Okay? And I don't care if you like it.
oscar These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
deangelo I don't care what your favorite flavor is. Here's a bowl of ice cream. You either like it or you don't. That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays. Alright? Clear? Any questions?
kevin This all sounds great to me. But I could see how some people might think that they're bad. I don't know what to think.
deangelo That is a s-- astute observation, Kevin.
deangelo Kev's got me pegged.
deangelo It blows away Vermont in the fall.
darryl Snap, for real?
pam Good morning, Deangelo.
deangelo Hold on.
pam Okay.
deangelo And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring.
pam Because of the flowers.
deangelo No. Because the entire state smells like Earth.
pam Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
deangelo Yes, Pam.
pam Hey, well, good morning. I think I have good news for you today. I found your new executive assistant. My friend Carla. She's got great experience. We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
deangelo Put it with the rest.
pam Okay.
deangelo Hey dudes!
jim Hey!
andy Hey!
pam Oh my God, he hates me!
jim No he doesn't. You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
pam I know.
jim Every time there's a silence, your brain's like "Heh-heh-huh-huh" .
pam Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
jim Careful. There is no inner circle.
andy Oh, there's an inner circle. Oh yeah.
jim There is no inner circle. deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
kevin jim only says that because he's in the inner circle. I also say that because I am also in the inner circle. Did you get that, Ma? Your boy, kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle! Which doesn't exist.
deangelo There he is! Got ya coffee.
dwight Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you.
deangelo Not a coffee guy, I take it.
dwight It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
deangelo Listen. I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want.
dwight I think you'll find what you're looking for over there.
deangelo No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. It reminds me of my relationship with my son. Except there, I'm the Dwight.
deangelo Who's the biggest client in the state? I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes. Huh? What do you guys say?
kevin Yes!
deangelo Right! Or my other idea, 50, 000 tiny clients.
kevin Yeah, I say we just go for it!
deangelo Is that ball lighter than usual? Is that a Chinatown knockoff?
jim That's Toys R Us, I think.
deangelo No, that's definitely a knockoff. You can feel the center of gravity's off. Feel that. What do you think?
gabe Oh, yeah, totally. Jim, you got ripped off big time.
deangelo Deangelo! See what I did there? That's what you need to do. It's that little English. The British are coming.
kevin Yes.
deangelo Deangelo's open!
deangelo Hey Ry. Your department's killing it, baby.
ryan Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
deangelo Keep it up.
ryan The problem with having "It" or "the X-factor" or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table. So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor. It's not even that much of a stretch. She pretty much does whatever I say.
kelly What?
ryan I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
kelly Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
ryan Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly? I'll tell you what I would have done for you. I'd lie for you.
kelly Yeah, but you lie all the time. You lie for no reason. Ryan, you just like to lie.
ryan I'd die for you too.
kelly You really would?
ryan Hey, kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
kelly Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
deangelo Woo. Glad he's not my boss.
ryan You're the best. Thank you.
deangelo You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's.
dwight Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.
deangelo You know what. straight up, why don't you like me?
dwight I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?
deangelo Ohhhh no.
dwight What?
deangelo Okay? I'm gonna win you over.
dwight No you're not.
deangelo Yes I am.
dwight No.
deangelo Oh yes.
dwight No.
deangelo Yes.
dwight No.
deangelo Yes.
dwight No.
deangelo Yes.
dwight No.
deangelo Yes.
dwight No.
deangelo Yes. Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
jim Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled "administrative" and "assistant. "
darryl The
winner under "Special Skills, " Mr. Don Feiner put "Juggling. "
deangelo What's wrong with juggling, Darryl? I'm a big juggler. I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.
jim Seriously?
deangelo Oh yeah. I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet? 320?
gabe 320. Just freeballin' it.
deangelo It's a little cramped. How many square feet out there? 17, 18 hundo?
kevin Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
gabe Give or take.
deangelo Sorry gang. Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car. It's not.
pam Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
andy I gotcha covered, boss. Used to play with the parabolas myself. Got some extra balls! Hey-hey-hey-ho!
deangelo Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments. You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? Prepare. to go into the danger zone.
pam Oh wow, you weren't kidding.
deangelo No. Never. Can someone please throw me a fifth ball? If you dare! Incoming! And we're on! Remember, nothing's impossible! Phyllis, where's Phyllis?
phyllis Here.
deangelo Do you believe in me, Phyllis?
phyllis Yeah.
deangelo Because I believe in you.
phyllis Okay.
deangelo Feel that connection? Don't move your head. Please. Thank you. Oh! Big hand for Phyllis! That took a lot of guts! Ho! I'm deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.
kevin Didn't drop a single ball!
pam Look. I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls. I'm juggling with one hand. No hands.
jim What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
pam What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine? How can you keep defending him?
jim He's good at his job. And I like working for him.
angela Of course you do, Jim. You're a man. deangelo is a huge sexist.
andy Whoa, whoa, whoa. I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell. I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell. And I wrote my own companion piece to the "v*g1n* Monologues" called the "pen1s Apologies. " So I know a thing or two.
angela Okay. Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin? What about pam and Kelly? Also department heads. But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
andy How could I not see it? You're so right.
pam Why don't you talk to him about it?
jim And say what? "Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"
pam Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
jim Mmm-hmm.
andy And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his pen1s goodbye. Snip snip. Am I right, girls?
jim Hey, you got a second?
deangelo Yeah, I got tons of time. This job's a joke. . push;
deangelo So what's up?
jim Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
darryl Hey, saw jim come in. We meeting?
deangelo Yeah sure. Let's make it a meeting.
jim If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
deangelo What's the big secret? Why are you even whispering? Come on, it's the guys!
jim I know. Just the guys. Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem. I think. so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads. Uh, some of the female department heads.
deangelo Uh-oh. Right?
kevin Hot!
jim Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are. a little sexist, or --
darryl Damn!
jim Whoa. Whoa. Wait.
deangelo Are you serious? Who feels this way?
jim Oh. Like nobody.
gabe Umm, Pam?
jim It was --
gabe Was it Pam?
kevin That sounds like Pam. You know how she gets. Deangelo, she can get really bitchy. Kevin.
deangelo Guys. Hold on. Doesn't matter who, okay? I'm just happy that jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea.
jim That's awesome.
deangelo Thank you.
kelly Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight. No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time. He won't ever stand us up again.
ryan So I am the new customer service supervisor.
kelly When Deangelo's around.
ryan And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
kelly All the time.
ryan All the time.
deangelo Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?
erin Absolutely.
jim Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
deangelo Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim. Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist. I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not. I am not a sexist. Raise your hand if you have a v*g1n*. Raise your hand if someone you love has a v*g1n*. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Just about everyone. What about Deangelo's hand? Oh wow. He's got 'em both up. Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men. Okay? Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.
phyllis I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
deangelo Dwight, what's your take?
dwight What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all.
deangelo Man, you're smart. Oh, hey! Hi! Hello. Welcome. Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome jordan Garfield. This is everyone.
jordan Hello.
pam So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before? Uh, a law office?
jordan No, Anthropology. We don't have this in that size, pretty lame.
kelly Lame? You worked at Anthropology?
jordan Yeah.
kelly That's like my dream job. How did you even get that job?
jordan Well, I umm -
kelly You chose this job over that job?
ryan Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
pam So, umm, is this your first office job then?
jordan Yeah.
deangelo Yup.
pam Wow.
deangelo No corporate experience whatsoever. I didn't want anyone with any bad habits.
kevin Jim, you coming?
jim Oh yeah, did he text us?
kevin Yeah.
dwight No!
pam Jim, what are you doing? Get in there. This is not the time to take a stand. At least he likes one of us.
jim He didn't text me.
andy Yes! I'm in.
angela Andy, what are you doing?
andy I'm going in, into the belly of the beast. Gonna infiltrate and change from within. What's up, mancave!
pam Just go in. Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
deangelo Internally, for office use where do we get our paper from? Do we go -
jim Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
deangelo Hey Jim.
jim Yeah.
deangelo Can I help you?
jim Nope. Just. Okay.
dwight So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
jim Well, there is no inner. circle.
jordan Dwight? deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
dwight Really? Anything.
jordan Do you need anything?
dwight Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
andy Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief. Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market. deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week. deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project. Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
jim So this is my life. Until I win the lottery . Or pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
pam So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods. And she becomes. The Horse Flyer.
ryan Hey! Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck! Okay? We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
deangelo No one likes a money grubber.
kelly I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money. I can't do this. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I just can't do it. Deangelo, ryan is not my boss. Okay? Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
deangelo Ohh.
ryan Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
kelly No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo. He's like Rango. He doesn't work here, basically. Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals. It was just a big misunderstanding.
deangelo Is this true, Ryan?
ryan I did not see Rango.
deangelo Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said.
kelly He's not saying anything!
deangelo It's too murky. I like Ryan. You seem kind of hysterical to me. Ryan's your supervisor. Let's just leave it that way.
kelly That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti--
ryan Oh, close call! Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
pam Hey! It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
gabe Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic jordan himself.
deangelo Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?
gabe Total brain burp.
deangelo I'm no MJ. I can do his dunk. From the free throw line.
kevin Whoa.
darryl Daaamn! Mad respect for my brotha!
darryl The man is paying me to take Chinese. I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
pam Okay, well it's just really loud.
deangelo Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Alright, ladies, back to the game.
darryl Do it!
deangelo Jim! Come on in.
pam You're back in.
jim You know what? Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition? I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
deangelo Yeah, we'll set that up one day.
jim Today. Now, maybe. 'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
deangelo Yeah, I don't know.
jim Why not?
deangelo Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it.
dwight Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
deangelo Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper!
dwight Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership.
jim Alright, there you go.
deangelo Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?
jim 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
deangelo Nah, that's 15. Yeah.
jim Okay.
deangelo And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?
jordan Seriously?
deangelo Yeah, come on. I'll dunk over you. Best seat in the house.
jordan I don't, I don't think I can do that. I'm holding your jewelry.
deangelo Right. Yeah. Okay, fair enough. Kevin, you do it.
kevin Yes! Okay.
deangelo Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap? Angela?
angela No.
deangelo Oscar?
oscar No thank you.
deangelo Okay, Jimmy, this is for you. Show you that anything is possible.
jim Fantastic.
deangelo Alright?
jim Yup.
deangelo This is also for the troops. Doctor is in! Ahhhh!
jim Now what?
erin Deangelo?
deangelo Tablab.
jim Oh my God, are you alright? Erin, will you call 911 please?
erin Who should I say is calling?
jim Erin.
deangelo says to bartender Droswip. Droswip.
gabe Droswip, yeah. I get it. Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
