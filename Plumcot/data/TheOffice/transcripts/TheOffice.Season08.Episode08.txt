gabe_lewis The Sabre Code of Conduct outlines the governing principles key to establishing and maintaining trust with our employees, clients-
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, kill me!
andy_bernard Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.
gabe_lewis Oh, is it okay with you? Because if it's not, you work for me, so... Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and contracts governing our business. Be honest, fair-
pam_beesly I'm gonna do it.
gabe_lewis And trustworthy in all your business activities and relationships. Treat one another-
pam_beesly Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!
jim_halpert Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
pam_beesly I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.
pam_beesly I'm going into labor!
phyllis_vance Or should I have corndogs. I mean-
pam_beesly I'm going into labor!
ryan_howard Okay, three reasons you are wrong about True Blood. Number one-
pam_beesly I'm going into labor.
pam_beesly Here we go!
andy_bernard Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it.
kelly_kapoor Yeah.
oscar_martinez It's not fair, you guys.
kelly_kapoor Pitiful.
meredith_palmer It's stupid.
andy_bernard Never cry wolf.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Okay.
erin_hannon Oh.
pam_beesly Oh! Oh!
all@ Oh! Oh my goodness!
jim_halpert Oh my God!
pam_beesly I'm really in labor! This is happening!
jim_halpert Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
pam_beesly Oh!
jim_halpert How do you feel?
erin_hannon Drive carefully!
oscar_martinez Good luck!
all@ Goodbye! Good luck!
pam_beesly False alarm.
andy_bernard What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.
andy_bernard I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.
andy_bernard Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?
erin_hannon It's right here in PA.
andy_bernard Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-
angela_martin Okay, Andy, we get it. It's a trip to Gettysburg.
andy_bernard That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
dwight_schrute Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
oscar_martinez Actually it is the northernmost.
dwight_schrute Ha!
dwight_schrute The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
andy_bernard Charge!
phyllis_vance Well, this could be fun. I-
andy_bernard Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?
ryan_howard What's the halal option?
andy_bernard Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.
ryan_howard Out.
andy_bernard You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?
erin_hannon I'm in.
phyllis_vance I'm in too.
dwight_schrute Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
andy_bernard Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.
kevin_malone Yes!
andy_bernard One for you.
erin_hannon Cool. Thanks.
andy_bernard And one for you.
jim_halpert Cool. Thanks.
andy_bernard And- oh. You missed your head. There you go. Phyllis, think fast!
andy_bernard All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.
darryl_philbin You know, I just got Limitless on my iPad. I bet I could get it on the TV.
phyllis_vance Ooh. Isn't that the one where the guy becomes limitless?
andy_bernard It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.
all@ Limitless! Limitless! Limitless! Limitless!
andy_bernard All right, all right, all right.
kevin_malone Not food and stuff.
pam_beesly Here. Like it?
kevin_malone Oh, if you buy the picnic table then you've got to get the fire pit.
pam_beesly I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.
kevin_malone The fire pit is a no-brainer.
robert_california Oh, hi there.
pam_beesly Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.
robert_california Where is everyone? Where is Andy?
kelly_kapoor Andy took some of the other people on a corporate retreat to Gettysburg.
robert_california Well, I was hoping to talk out some ideas with Andy. But what we have here... is perhaps better. By not going on the trip, you've shown you're the free-thinkers of the office.
ryan_howard Robert, you got your sheep and you got your black sheep, and I'm not even a sheep. I'm on the freaking moon.
robert_california So, here what we can do. Game changers- changes to the game such that the game can never be played the same way again. Everyone, brainstorm some innovations. Don't be afraid to get weird with it. Meredith! Excited!
kevin_malone Okay.
andy_bernard You guys...
darryl_philbin J-j-j-ju...
andy_bernard Get excited!
darryl_philbin Shh! Movie's almost over.
andy_bernard All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.
gabe_lewis Fun fact. In France, they call Limitless 'The Man with Many Capabilities.'
andy_bernard Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.
darryl_philbin I got Source Code on the way back.
all@ Ooh! All right!
andy_bernard Woo!
andy_bernard Whoa, where you going?
jim_halpert Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
andy_bernard Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.
jim_halpert No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
phyllis_vance Yeah, sign says "Begin tour here."
andy_bernard Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.
andy_bernard After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.
erin_hannon Yeah, but I'm confused...
dwight_schrute Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
erin_hannon Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute ...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
erin_hannon Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
dwight_schrute Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
oscar_martinez Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
dwight_schrute The truth.
oscar_martinez Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
erin_hannon Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
dwight_schrute No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
erin_hannon Interesting.
dwight_schrute Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
oscar_martinez Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
dwight_schrute Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
oscar_martinez he's a historian.
dwight_schrute Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
oscar_martinez Yes, yes, yes!
dwight_schrute Not by a long shot!
erin_hannon No!
oscar_martinez Yes!
dwight_schrute No, it was not!
oscar_martinez Argh!
dwight_schrute No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
oscar_martinez What?
dwight_schrute Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
oscar_martinez Erin-
dwight_schrute Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
erin_hannon Get out of here!
robert_california I am so eager to hear your game-changers. Let's dig in, shall we?
ryan_howard May I go first?
robert_california Absolutely.
ryan_howard Raw fish- the disgusting food from Japan that Americans would never want to eat. Now, we can't get enough of it. From movie stars to construction workers, sushi is what's for dinner. Let me throw another idea at you. Origami. What? The crazy art of paper folding from, that's right, Japan. Don't you wish you could go back to 1980 and open the first sushi restaurant in Manhattan? We can do that! With... origami. It's the sushi of paper.
robert_california This idea hasn't gripped me. What else did you come up with?
ryan_howard Well I had to memorize the presentation, Robert, and it took a long time to build the swan, so-
robert_california That was bad.
stanley_hudson If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can't there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. 'Papyr.' Paper for women. It's pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.
robert_california The situation you described, returning home to a wife complaining about her paper being too masculine, is not one I'm familiar with.
stanley_hudson In the African-American community-
robert_california No.
stanley_hudson Thought it was worth a try.
darryl_philbin That's fascinating. Tell me, what's the significance of the peach orchard, thought?
park_ranger Ranger Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most-
dwight_schrute Excuse me, I got a question for you.
park_ranger Ranger Sure.
dwight_schrute Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
park_ranger Ranger Uh, I haven't heard of that one.
dwight_schrute Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
oscar_martinez I apologize for my friend and for the Republicans who are cutting your funding.
andy_bernard We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!
chelseas_mother Are you Lincoln?
gabe_lewis No, no, I'm-
gabe_lewis Apparently, I bear a passing resemblance to Abraham Lincoln. Makes it kind of hard for me to go to places like museums, historical monuments, elementary schools... I don't see it.
chelseas_mother Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your hat so I can take a picture.
gabe_lewis Okay, Quick.
cathy_simms Hey! Lincoln's starting.
gabe_lewis Oh, uh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm, uh, I'm actually with a tour group myself, so- Hello! I'm Abraham Lincoln! Some people call me the great emancipator, but, uh, you might know me from the penny.
pam_beesly Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.
robert_california I am not.
pam_beesly Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
pam_beesly At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.
robert_california Kevin, you've been quiet. I'm curious to know what your game-changer is.
kevin_malone Well, you know how in the vending machine they have the chocolate chip cookies in the A-1 spot? They do that 'cause they think A-1's the best spot for the best cookie. But the real best spot is D-4. Right? That's where the eyes go. So...
robert_california Cookies. Cookie placement.
kevin_malone Yeah. But not just the cookies, though. That was just a 'for instance.'
robert_california Who else agrees with Kevin, that we're wasting facilities, manpower, on our underselling products when we should be pushing our top-performers? There you go. Consensus.
ryan_howard Okay, we are now on a planet where Kevin is the most creative person around, and I am just some good-looking guy.
gabe_lewis I just don't understand. It's 1865, victory is ours, I've saved the very soul of our nation, and yet... happiness eludes me. Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater will enliven my spirits.
Audience#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode08 No!
kevin_malone 'Kay, so another thing about oatmeal cookies. Who even wants them? I mean, I've seen Toby eat one, like, once, but other than that... like, forget it.
robert_california Interesting. So what is Dunder Mifflin's oatmeal cookie? What is the product that no one wants?
stanley_hudson how about that two-hole-punch letter? Only the lawyers want that punch at the top and they use legal.
robert_california That's the oatmeal cookie. Fantastic, Kevin. Fantastic.
kevin_malone Thank you.
jim_halpert By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?
andy_bernard Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.
jim_halpert Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
andy_bernard Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.
darryl_philbin Hunger for hamburger.
erin_hannon Hunger for chicken chimichangas. Right, Darryl?
darryl_philbin That's good.
andy_bernard Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.
jim_halpert Only two hundred dollars?
andy_bernard We are all branches on this tree. And from the tree comes paper. We're all part of a business. But business is war. What's that I hear? Uh, a rebel paper company is coming to take our flag! Wha- what's going on here? Wee-hoo! Come and get it! Who's gonna get the flag? Who's getting it? Whoa! Hey! Ho! Don't look where I am, look where I'm going. Juke right, juke left.
darryl_philbin Andy, this is inappropriate. People died here, man.
andy_bernard Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!
andy_bernard Spangler Springs is a mile this way.
jim_halpert Oh wow. So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
andy_bernard Its... I mean come on.
phyllis_vance I don't think I should walk anymore. You know all I had for breakfast was oatmeal, yogurt, coffee, orange juice and toast. Two poached eggs. And then half a sandwich on the bus.
andy_bernard Alright fine. You know what – I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me.
dwight_schrute You said you weren't going to look back.
robert_california And why is Black Rock suddenly the paragon by which all hedge funds must now be compared?
kevin_malone I don't know.
robert_california Right. I mean you're an accountant. Those bogus prospectuses must drive you insane.
kevin_malone Yes. I am an accountant.
oscar_martinez Dwight – this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.
dwight_schrute Really?
oscar_martinez Yeah.
dwight_schrute Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Archivist#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode08 Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War.
oscar_martinez You've heard about it?
dwight_schrute YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.
Archivist#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode08 There you go.
Narrator#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode08 Families and sweethearts back home waited desperately for letters from the front.
Soldier#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode08 Dearest mother I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris.
dwight_schrute Hallowed ground.
Narrator#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode08 But the Battle at Schrute Farms was no battle at all. It was a code used by pacifists from both North and South who turned the Pennsylvania farmhouse into an artistic community and a refuge from the war.
amanda_fieldsshad You have to understand. Poets, artists, dancers – these kind of men preferred peace to war. These delicate lovely men found a place of refuge among the Schrutes at Schrute Farms. Amidst the macho brutality of war this was a place where dandies and dreamers could put on plays and sing tender ballads and dance in the moonlight. I like to think of Schrute Farms as the Underground Railroad for the sensitive... and well... fabulous.
oscar_martinez Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.
dwight_schrute I've seen enough.
oscar_martinez You're right. There should be a monument to this.
kevin_malone Never trust a cookie with a woman's name. Pecan Sandy. Lorna Doone. Madeline. They'll just break your heart.
robert_california Kevin!
ryan_howard Robert I hate to interrupt. But I would love to pitch you one last idea. I call it the Big Mac idea.
kevin_malone What?!? No!
robert_california Big Mac idea. That sounds encouraging.
ryan_howard It's really, really good Robert. Let me explain.
kevin_malone No! This is not fair! This is my idea. He's trying to steal it because he's jealous of me.
robert_california Well what is the idea?
kevin_malone Every time you buy a Big Mac you set one ingredient aside. Then at the end of the week you have a free Big Mac. And you love it even more because you made it with your own hands.
ryan_howard You know what? Now I remember. That was your idea. That is 100 percent your idea.
robert_california Oh my. It was just actually cookies the whole time?
andy_bernard Dammit.
darryl_philbin Hey.
andy_bernard You guys came. Where's everyone else?
darryl_philbin Back at the bus. We were locked out. Phyllis is sitting on the ground eating a dirty sandwich.
andy_bernard Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there. I guess he follows orders.
jim_halpert Yeah sorry everyone else didn't come. I think they're just tired. With holes in their shoes. And they have dysentery.
andy_bernard Even without an audience you're still at it.
jim_halpert What are you talking about?
andy_bernard Our office has a disease. And it goes by many names. Sarcasm. Snark. Wisecracks. You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes. That's what you did with this trip.
jim_halpert Andy – this whole idea of our situation being just like war? It's just not true. We just work at a paper company. And you're our regional manager. And guess what man? You don't have to prove anything. We like you as regional manager. Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head. I'm wearing a very pink hat. I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure "DM does GB" means something kinda sexual. But guess who's wearing them? All of us. Just for you man. That's huge.
andy_bernard You don't like the hats?
jim_halpert They're terrible.
darryl_philbin I hate myself.
andy_bernard They just didn't turn out how I wanted. In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.
andy_bernard The world will little note, nor long remember the fight Jim and I had here at Gettysburg and that's good because I was basically wrong. I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general. But I guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and I'm their manager. Yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.
gabe_lewis Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. Oh Mary this is wonderful... Ok Mary stop your scolding. I'll be quiet. I need her like I need a hole in the head! BANG! Ooh
