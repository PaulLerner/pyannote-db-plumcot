erin_hannon Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
dwight_schrute How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
doctor Mr. Schrute, the results are in. You are not the father.
angela_martin I told you
kevin_malone Oh, what a summer! An emotional roller-coaster. I ran over a turtle in the parking lot, but then I saved him by gluing his shell back together. But I'm not that good at puzzles.
oscar_martinez That piece doesn't go there.
kevin_malone So I patched him with stuff from around the office. But I couldn't get the pieces to fit right. Then one day, when I was reaching for the glue, I crushed his shell again. But I rebuilt him even better that time. But it turned out the turtle was already day. Probably when I ran over him the first time.
pam_beesly For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.
jim_halpert You are really good at modesty. She's a genius. She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children—
pam_beesly Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah
pam_beesly Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.
jim_halpert Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
pam_beesly And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.
jim_halpert In Philly, so, that doesn't really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
pam_beesly He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car.
jim_halpert An Altima or better.
toby_flenderson Kelly Kapoor is gone. Her fiancé Ravi was hired as a pediatrics professor at Miami university.
kelly_kapoor I don't need em anymore. I am going to Miami biotches. To hang with Lebron James and Gloria Estefan.
toby_flenderson Miami University in Ohio. On her last day, Kelly was still a little confused about it
kelly_kapoor Enjoy the snow losers.
erin_hannon I'm so happy for you Kelly.
toby_flenderson Shortly after Kelly left, Ryan quit and also moved to Ohio, for what he claimed were unrelated reasons.
ryan_howard I've actually done a lot of market research and it actually turns out that southwestern Ohio is going to be the next Silicon Valley. They call it the Silicon Prairie. It's a big university town. And, uh, that's not garbage, it's out clothes.
pam_beesly And that was our summer.
jim_halpert we good?
Off-camera#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode01 Yeah
pam_beesly Don't you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.
Off-camera#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode01 Well we're more following you guys, to see how you turn out.
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.
erin_hannon Andy's coming back today!
clark Hey, uh, does anybody know where we throw these out?
stanley_hudson Oh, my god. It's called a garbage can.
phyllis_vance Helpless.
toby_flenderson There's two new guys back there with me now. They're in their 20s. And we really get along.
clark You're looking good.
toby_flenderson Just three single guys. Getting into trouble.
stanley_hudson They're like the new Jim and Dwight.
nellie_bertram Oh, yes, yes I see that! Perfect.
meredith_palmer Hey, new Jim, come sit on my face.
pete_miller No thank you. My name's Pete.
jim_halpert No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face. And if that makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.
erin_hannon Andy's here! Old Dwight, new Dwight, Andy's here. New Jim, Tuna, Andy's here. Pam, he's here.
andy_bernard Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!
nellie_bertram It sounds amazing, tell us all about it.
andy_bernard What're you still doing here?
nellie_bertram Wonderful, thanks.
andy_bernard You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.
nellie_bertram Brilliant.
andy_bernard See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, um—
pete_miller Pete!
andy_bernard In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.
pete_miller What? Why?
andy_bernard Cause you're always taking dumps.
pete_miller No I'm not.
andy_bernard Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.
clark I love it.
darryl_philbin Actually, Andy, we call this one Dwight, Jr.
clark No, I prefer Fart.
andy_bernard No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
dwight_schrute I don't see it.
clark I don't either.
andy_bernard Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
dwight_schrute Yes, yes I am.
andy_bernard Dwight, Jr!
dwight_schrute In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.
angela_martin Well, I need to give my cat up for adoption.
kevin_malone The one who uses the doorbell, or the one with the Mexican hat, or the one with the rain galoshes, or the one you let go around naked?
kevin_malone Angela's cats are cute. So cute that you just want to eat them. But you can't eat cats. You can't eat cats, Kevin.
angela_martin No, the one with the long hair and the denim pants, Comstock! Ok, look . He's such a special kitty. I just want to find him a good home. He loves those pants
kevin_malone I'll take him.
angela_martin Please, after the turtle?
kevin_malone I am enormously proud of what I did for that turtle!
angela_martin Oscar, Oscar, will you take him?
oscar_martinez No, I'm a dog person.
angela_martin If you pray enough, you can change yourself into a cat person.
oscar_martinez Those guys always change back, Angela.
andy_bernard David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.
state_senator_rob_lipton Glad to hear it. You sound very confident and decisive.
toby_flenderson Hey you wanted to see me?
andy_bernard Yeah, I gotta go David. Why is Nellie still here?
toby_flenderson You can only fire Nellie for cause.
andy_bernard Mm, then I will make up a cause.
toby_flenderson Except you just told me you were gonna make it up. Now if she sues, I have to testify against you.
andy_bernard Then forget I just told you that.
toby_flenderson Can't. I took a course at the Weintraub Memory Academy. I sat next to this woman named Beverly Brook. She had a Greek salad for lunch. See what I mean?
andy_bernard Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
dwight_schrute Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
clark Yep, body by Cheez-it
dwight_schrute Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
clark I think I'm busy that night. Or I would.
dwight_schrute Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?
clark Learning what?
dwight_schrute Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
clark Kay.
dwight_schrute So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
clark Is this—is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you should know that I'm into the ladies.
dwight_schrute Spoken like a true root man.
clark You know, if you're ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
dwight_schrute My calls?
clark So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet?
dwight_schrute You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
clark Yeah, I'll just give it a glance—
dwight_schrute Ok
clark I'll give it a read.
dwight_schrute With my leads and stuff like that?
clark Yeah.
dwight_schrute Cause you're interested in going into sales?
clark I am.
dwight_schrute Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?
clark Ok.
dwight_schrute You're not getting my clients! Nice try.
dwight_schrute Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
dwight_schrute Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
jim_halpert Done. Explain.
dwight_schrute The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
jim_halpert Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
dwight_schrute Wait, sales—what sales meeting?
jim_halpert The new guys called one.
dwight_schrute The new guys called a sales meeting?
jim_halpert Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
dwight_schrute There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
jim_halpert You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. Too easy.
angela_martin Attention everyone. Comstock is still available. Oscar has been flirting with adopting him. But still hasn't given me a definite yes or no.
oscar_martinez Definitely no.
angela_martin Fine. For any interested candidates, I will be conducting 20 minute interviews. My ideal situation would an independently wealthy cute couple with a strong commitment to education. Black or white, I'm fine with either, but not both. Listen, you're in this, but you need to wow me, ok?
andy_bernard I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible.
nellie_bertram Not necessarily
andy_bernard No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you.
andy_bernard Now this is called slack lining.
andy_bernard I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.
andy_bernard If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.
rafe Iceman.
andy_bernard That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.
jim_halpert You a sports fan?
pete_miller Sure, boxing, tennis.
jim_halpert Oh. Any team sports?
pete_miller NASCAR. The Amazing Race.
jim_halpert Phillies fan, though, right?
pete_miller You mean horses?
jim_halpert No, like baseball. A baseball team.
pete_miller Ah, I like the Red Sox. I'm from Vermont.
jim_halpert Ok. Good talk.
jim_halpert I have nothing in common with Plop.
andy_bernard All right, who's next? Nellie?
nellie_bertram Oh, I would rather watch you and your talented friends.
andy_bernard Nonsense. Get up here.
kevin_malone Go ahead
andy_bernard Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?
nellie_bertram I'm very self-conscious about my feet.
andy_bernard Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?
darryl_philbin This seems like the kind of thing white people with dreadlocks do.
andy_bernard Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.
clark Uh, I guess I could give it shot.
andy_bernard Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.
clark Ok
andy_bernard Focus on the horizon. Whoa! Look at this guy.
clark I've always been good at anything that required balance. My doctor says I have gigantic inner ears.
darryl_philbin Go, Dwight Jr!
andy_bernard Hey, yes.
dwight_schrute Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!
clark Alright, let's see you do it.
andy_bernard Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.
andy_bernard Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
dwight_schrute Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
clark You got this, it's all you. Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It's not a race, Dwight.
andy_bernard Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
dwight_schrute That's not true. Just give me another chance.
oscar_martinez But your mouth is ble—
toby_flenderson This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this.
dwight_schrute What?
toby_flenderson It is enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work.
dwight_schrute This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Idiots.
dwight_schrute Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!
pam_beesly Dwight!
dwight_schrute Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
pam_beesly What are you doing?
dwight_schrute Come here, I'll show you.
angela_martin Why do you want this cat?
pete_miller I don't want it, really.
angela_martin How would you support the cat? What are your ambitions?
pete_miller I want to start my own business. I want to be a millionaire. Lots of things. Travel, make the world a better place, earn an MBA at night.
angela_martin Have you taken any concrete steps?
pete_miller Well, I'm still just fitting in here, you know? Getting used to the new job. But, definitely on the agenda. But that is a good idea, Angela. I should make a list.
jim_halpert Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
dwight_schrute Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
pam_beesly I will?
dwight_schrute You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?
pam_beesly Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
dwight_schrute So you'll do it?
pam_beesly No.
dwight_schrute Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
pam_beesly Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
dwight_schrute Come on.
pam_beesly Exactly the way it is.
dwight_schrute No, Pam.
pam_beesly Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
dwight_schrute Please? Please, Pam?
pam_beesly Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis.
dwight_schrute I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive.
pete_miller Why are you getting rid of it?
angela_martin Allergies.
pete_miller Your husband?
angela_martin No, the baby. Please, it's my husband's favorite cat. He's broken up about it. It's the only time I've seen him cry other than our wedding night.
oscar_martinez You know what? I will take Comstock.
angela_martin Really? Oh, Oscar, thank you!
oscar_martinez I'll come by after work and pick him up.
angela_martin Yay! Oh, poor Robert. He won't get to say goodbye. He has this business dinner tonight
oscar_martinez C'est la vie.
angela_martin Please don't teach the cat French.
oscar_martinez Yeah. Good news, tonight when you come over for dinner, you can play with your old buddy Comstock.
pam_beesly You ready?
jim_halpert Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
pam_beesly Kay.
dwight_schrute Ok. Oh, god.
dwight_schrute Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
jim_halpert Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah!
dwight_schrute Woo! Ahh!!
creed_bratton In the parking lot today there was a circus. The copier did tricks on the high-wire, a lady tried to give away a baby that looked like a cat. There was a Dwight impersonator and a Jim impersonator; a strong man crushed a turtle. I laughed and I cried. Not bad for a day in the life of a dog food company.
meredith_palmer Crap. Sorry, Nellie.
nellie_bertram Once again, I understand that old habits die hard, but if everyone would kindly walk their refuse to the trash bins instead of tossing them, then we would—
stanley_hudson Mm, swish.
nellie_bertram Oh, it's nothing to do with me. I just happen to be sitting near to where the bins are.
andy_bernard There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.
nellie_bertram Fluke.
