michael_scott Pam?
pam_beesly Yeah?
michael_scott Did you see Oprah yesterday?
pam_beesly No, I didn't.
michael_scott I, uh... I am going to be a father.
pam_beesly What was Oprah about?
michael_scott Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
pam_beesly That's a really big decision.
michael_scott I know.
pam_beesly Maybe you should wait before you adopt.
michael_scott Well...
pam_beesly Or not adopt.
michael_scott Just do it, okay?
pam_beesly Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.
michael_scott Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
pam_beesly You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.
michael_scott Eight months?
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
pam_beesly You probably won't.
michael_scott You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...
pam_beesly No, Michael.
michael_scott Twenty years.
pam_beesly No, Michael.
michael_scott Thirty.
pam_beesly Sure.
michael_scott It's a deal.
ryan_howard All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.
michael_scott Yesh.
ryan_howard Uh, fun jeans.
michael_scott Right there. Ah.
angela_martin Sign.
michael_scott Per diem.
michael_scott Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled s*x romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.
dwight_schrute Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
angela_martin But I don't understand. It's for managers.
dwight_schrute Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
angela_martin I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together. Are you still there?
dwight_schrute Yes, Monkey.
angela_martin Don't "Monkey" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.
angela_martin In the Martin family, we like to say, "Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly." That's code for "check out the slut." What is... why are there flies in here?
kelly_kapoor Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?
pam_beesly This.
kelly_kapoor You look so pretty.
pam_beesly Thank you.
pam_beesly Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.
kelly_kapoor Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.
michael_scott Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
kelly_kapoor My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.
michael_scott Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
dwight_schrute And your veil.
michael_scott Yeah, do it!
pam_beesly I'll probably just wear this.
michael_scott Really? Okay. Well, word of advice unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
pam_beesly Um...
michael_scott Um. Okay, um.
dwight_schrute Um.
michael_scott You got that?
dwight_schrute I got it.
michael_scott Write it down.
dwight_schrute I got it.
dwight_schrute Um.
michael_scott Um.
dwight_schrute and Michael Um, um, um...
creed_bratton There's my girl. I noticed you handing out some shekels. How would one get on that train?
angela_martin That was for per diem, for Philadelphia.
meredith_palmer That town smells like cheese steaks.
angela_martin That town is full of history!
creed_bratton Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. Creed.
dwight_schrute Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
josh_porter Hey, Michael.
michael_scott Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
josh_porter Pretty good.
michael_scott Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
michael_scott I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.
jim_halpert It's really good to see you, man.
michael_scott Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
dwight_schrute Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
jim_halpert Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
michael_scott Hey!
dwight_schrute Shut up. That's impossible.
jim_halpert No, it's not. I did. Yep.
dwight_schrute Well, I did it too.
jim_halpert You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.
kevin_malone So did you hear?
toby_flenderson What?
kevin_malone Pam's back on the market again.
toby_flenderson Really? She's dating?
kevin_malone If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
dwight_schrute So what kind of commissions you get up there?
jim_halpert Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
dwight_schrute You're so immature!
josh_porter Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.
michael_scott Ah.
josh_porter And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.
jan_levinson Oh, hey!
dwight_schrute Hey, Jan.
jan_levinson We all checked in?
josh_porter Yes.
jan_levinson Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.
josh_porter Okay.
jan_levinson Okay!
michael_scott Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
jan_levinson What are you talking about?
michael_scott The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
jan_levinson Step away from me, Michael.
michael_scott Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
kelly_kapoor Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
kelly_kapoor And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
dwight_schrute This party is going to be awesome.
michael_scott I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
dwight_schrute Check it out.
michael_scott That is crooked on that side.
dwight_schrute Wow.
michael_scott Hey hey!
jim_halpert That is a lot of liquor.
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert And a dart board.
michael_scott Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
josh_porter We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.
michael_scott Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
josh_porter A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.
jim_halpert Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
michael_scott Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
josh_porter Um, we should...
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
dwight_schrute I'll do a shot, Michael.
michael_scott Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
michael_scott SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.
michael_scott Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
jerome_bettis Bettis All right.
dwight_schrute I'm a huge fan.
jerome_bettis Bettis Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.
michael_scott You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
jerome_bettis Bettis All right, maybe. If I can.
michael_scott Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?
jerome_bettis Bettis No, you cannot.
michael_scott So maybe. See ya.
dwight_schrute Why do they call him The Bus?
michael_scott Because he's afraid to fly.
dwight_schrute Smile!
michael_scott Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
josh_porter All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.
michael_scott Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
dwight_schrute You don't have email on your phone.
michael_scott I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
dwight_schrute No one just called you.
josh_porter All right.
jim_halpert All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Ted#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode02 I'll see you soon.
josh_porter Yeah, stop by later.
michael_scott See you in a bit. Bye-bye. May I have a moment of your time please?
michael_scott I need you to do something for me.
dwight_schrute Yes. Anything.
michael_scott I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
dwight_schrute I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
toby_flenderson Hey, Pam.
pam_beesly Hey! What's up?
toby_flenderson It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...
pam_beesly Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. Sorry. What's up?
toby_flenderson Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.
pam_beesly Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.
toby_flenderson Okay.
dwight_schrute So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
michael_scott And?
dwight_schrute He wasn't volunteering today.
michael_scott Business has been pretty crazy around the office.
jim_halpert Oh yeah?
michael_scott Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
jim_halpert Oh, tell him I say hi.
michael_scott I will call him later with that message.
jim_halpert Hey, how is... Toby?
michael_scott Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
jim_halpert Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...
michael_scott Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
jim_halpert Michael, it's really not a competition.
josh_porter Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.
jan_levinson Great!
michael_scott Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
dwight_schrute Whoa. Michael.
waiter Wow, oh my God, thank you.
michael_scott You're welcome.
dwight_schrute Was that your per diem?
michael_scott No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
jan_levinson What have you generated, Michael?
michael_scott I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
jan_levinson What party?
michael_scott The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
jan_levinson Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.
phyllis_vance You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.
stanley_hudson If you do that, you're going to have to put out.
phyllis_vance Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.
angela_martin Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.
michael_scott Any messages for 308? All right.
michael_scott Hey hey, fellers.
jim_halpert Michael.
dwight_schrute Hey, Michael.
michael_scott What's up?
josh_porter Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.
michael_scott Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
josh_porter I don't think so.
michael_scott Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
josh_porter Fine! All right.
michael_scott Okay! Excellent. Oh...
dwight_schrute Keep the wing flaps.
michael_scott Shut it. Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. Say hi to Pam!
jim_halpert Josh, and Dwight Hi, Pam.
michael_scott Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. Pam says hi. Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
michael_scott You first.
dwight_schrute Come on. Nice try, Josh!
michael_scott Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
josh_porter Or what? We didn't bet anything, Michael.
michael_scott Well, let's...
josh_porter Yeah, we should go.
michael_scott Come on!
josh_porter We gotta go.
michael_scott Come on!
josh_porter Uh... we'll do it later.
evan Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line?
michael_scott Fine.
michael_scott Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.
evan That is so true. Ready?
michael_scott Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
evan Great.
michael_scott Sorry, my meeting ran late.
jan_levinson Really?
michael_scott Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
josh_porter They're exclusive with Staples.
michael_scott Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
dwight_schrute Yes! Ha!
jan_levinson Well, Michael, I underestimated you.
michael_scott Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
jim_halpert Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.
angela_martin D?
jim_halpert Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
kelly_kapoor So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.
alan Oh, great.
ryan_howard I don't want ketchup.
kelly_kapoor You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.
pam_beesly So how do you come up with your cartoons?
alan Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them.
pam_beesly You dream in cartoons? How fun!
michael_scott Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.
convention_worker I thought there was a party in here.
michael_scott This is the party.
convention_worker This is room 308?
michael_scott Party central! So, what can I do you for? All right.
alan See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels.
pam_beesly Huh.
alan Freedom fries for the table.
pam_beesly Freedom fries. Yeah.
alan Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, "Don't be edgy." But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it.
pam_beesly Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.
alan Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain.
pam_beesly More freedom fries.
alan Yeah.
pam_beesly That's great.
alan Okay.
pam_beesly I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.
jim_halpert Michael. Am I the first to arrive?
michael_scott People have been filtering in and out.
jim_halpert Can I get a drink?
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert Can I get a drink?
michael_scott Sure. You like Cosmos?
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
jim_halpert Michael...
michael_scott I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
jim_halpert Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.
michael_scott I'm not better than Josh.
jim_halpert Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
michael_scott Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
jim_halpert No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
michael_scott I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
jim_halpert Nope, that's okay.
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert That's all right.
michael_scott I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
jim_halpert Yeah. Okay, maybe.
evan Are we early?
michael_scott Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott Evan, this is Jim.
jim_halpert How are you?
evan Hey, uh... Arnie Reisman. Michael, Jim.
michael_scott Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
evan Do you guys work together?
jim_halpert No, we used to. Now we're friends.
michael_scott Best friends.
michael_scott Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular." But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
michael_scott Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? Ha, ha, ha.
dwight_schrute Ha, ha, ha, ha.
michael_scott Whoa. What are those stains?
dwight_schrute Blood, urine, or semen.
michael_scott Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
