creed It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. Keep it running.
creed Do I love being manager?. I love my kids. I love real estate. I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
creed Find out what language this is.
creed Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed.
jim He never called a meeting.
creed BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first "B" stand for?
pam What are we doing?
creed We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first "B" stand for?
kevin Um. Business!
creed I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! all right! The "O".
pam We need a new manager.
jim Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here? fred
henry Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
jim Really?
fred Yeah.
jim . What is it?
fred Nice try.
toby I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?
fred Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan.
gabe Well. it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
fred Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?
gabe How would we know that, if you don't.
jim You could just be saying it to get the job.
fred I guess I could be, if I was. who would do that?
jim How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
fred Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
jim Okay.
fred Color-code sent documents, TM.
jim Did you just trademark that.
toby W-What?
fred That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.
jim We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with toby and Gabe. Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
stanley Good morning.
darryl Good morning.
phyllis Good morning.
darryl Good morning.
phyllis Did you have a nice drive in?
darryl I did.
darryl I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm. bla-aaack!
andy 
erin It's good. I really hope you get it!
andy The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
erin Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
andy Don't even. EEEHHHH!!!!
erin You in the boss's chair!
andy EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
andy In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and. we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
erin Did you hear anything?
phyllis Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results.
phyllis It turns out that erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
erin So, phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but.
phyllis But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
erin Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
phyllis Mm.
erin But why not find out.
phyllis Yeah.
pam Should you really be so blatant about that?
dwight They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
pam Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
dwight Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it. warren
buffett Can you do any better on salary?
jim Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
warren What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.
jim Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
warren How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?
angela Okay. How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
kevin The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
toby How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here? robert
california You don't work in sales, do you.
toby Uh. Human Resources.
robert You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only. s*x. Everything. is s*x. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth. . Toby.
toby Yes.
gabe Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. Do you, um, do you think that you are?
robert Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
gabe No.
jim Can you. You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence. would be. in a dialogue with a subordinate?
robert Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
jim Yes.
robert That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object. whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
jim Yes.
robert Yes. You do.
jim He creeps me out. But, I think he might be a genius.
andy Good luck, Darryl.
darryl Thank you.
darryl Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
jim Oh.
darryl So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.
gabe Oh? Uh. we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
darryl Uh. yes?! I was. Little joke!
toby So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
darryl I thought that was your job.
toby Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
jim Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
darryl I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions. and consequences. of actions.
darryl Who's that?
jim So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
darryl I. I just thought you knew me.
jim Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. Cool?
darryl Let me. Oh. Cool. merv
bronte Did, uh, you just interview?
robert Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
merv What do you mean?
robert That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a. dying industry.
merv Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job.
merv Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and. I'm gonna die here.
dwight What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? What are you doing. ? Stop trying to figure me out.
robert I just did.
dwight You can't.
robert It's done.
dwight No, it's not.
robert I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing.
 You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]
dwight Stop trying to figure me out. Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
robert I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street.
dwight Get out.
dwight I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
merv You guys pay for relocation, though, right?
toby Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
merv Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just. I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
jim Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
merv I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just. I had to get outta there.
jim Is this a bad time to be doing this?
merv I'm having a bad time.
toby I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
merv Wait.
merv Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.
angela Thank you.
pam It's gorgeous, Angela.
kelly Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
meredith Wow.
angela It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
meredith Tell us the freaking story!
kevin Yeah! Tell us a story.
angela Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
pam Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
angela Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me?
pam That's not accurate.
angela Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide.
oscar Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, I'm a little excited. But overall, horrified.
jim Andy? You all set?
andy Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
phyllis Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
andy Augh.
erin I think andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
jim So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
andy For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here.
gabe Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
andy I wasn't acc-, accusing.
gabe Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
andy Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
toby I didn't think you were.
gabe I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally. . he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
gabe How many windows are there in New York City?
andy What?
gabe Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
andy Okay. Let me think. are you counting car windows?
gabe No. How far away is the Sun?
andy Uh, 93 million miles.
jim Is it?
andy Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870, 000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and. 333, 000 times heavier than the Earth. .
gabe Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN!
andy I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
darryl Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say "Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was. Clippy.
creed First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. Saving face. Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
pam How is this on me?
pam Hang up. Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. Intel has told us there were at least seven.
creed Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
pam They're the same picture.
kelly Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
jim Your department's just you, right?
kelly Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
gabe Great! Um, can we just.
kelly What was that?
gabe We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so.
kelly Am I not a serious candidate?
gabe What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. Um, what are your weaknesses?
kelly I don't have any, assh***.
dwight I want an interview.
dwight How's the family?
jim Good!
dwight Good. They good?
jim Yeah.
dwight What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
jim Peepa.
dwight Peepa, how is she?
jim Great.
dwight Great! Oh, that's great. We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
jim No.
dwight Now, listen. .
jim You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
dwight Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
jim Okay. That's vivid.
dwight I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a. m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited s*x breaks for you and Pam.
jim Yikes.
dwight erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
jim Well, you know how I like taking bribes.
dwight Ha ha!
jim Unfortunately, jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
dwight Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
jim Okay.
dwight Let me get that for you.
jim Thank you.
dwight Okay.
oscar Pam. I think robert is gay.
pam The Senator? He was married before, and he has a kid.
oscar So!?
pam And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
oscar I have a very strong suspicion.
pam Did you see him at a bathhouse?
oscar What bathhouse?
pam The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
oscar What?
pam Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
oscar My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
pam You're in the gay mafia.
oscar You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. You sound ignorant.
ryan You guys, um, talking Senator?
pam No.
oscar No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
ryan 'Cause he's totally gay?
ryan Um, how do I know that robert is gay? He "liked" my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning. David
brent Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. When do I start? Yeah.
phyllis Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
erin I. I don't think I can do that.
phyllis Bestiality. Yeah.
erin Well, that's not my personality.
phyllis If my daughter were asking me.
erin Yes?
phyllis I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them. . go get them.
erin I do really want him.
darryl So, uh. here you go.
jim Great.
darryl Hope it's all right.
jim I'm sure it's fine.
darryl The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
jim Howard Cline?
darryl Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
jim Oh. Deshaun Williams.
darryl Yes. How did he do?
jim He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser.
darryl Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
jim Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. . push; nellie
bertram First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.
toby But there aren't.
nellie Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
gabe A little un-specific.
nellie Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
jim That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
nellie Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. At least once a month, the lowest performing person. bye bye!
gabe How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
nellie Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
gabe Okay.
nellie By splitting the difference. Just. just, somewhere in the middle.
jim I think that's probably all we need to hear from.
nellie Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
jim That's very.
nellie You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
gabe Okay, that's not gonna be.
nellie Sockee!. is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you. you are cracking to go.
oscar Is there a front runner?
jim You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
oscar Well, there must be someone who stands out.
jim No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
oscar Well.
stanley The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
ryan Oh no, Stanley. you'll live forever.
stanley My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously.
jim Uh--
meredith You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life.
jim Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
oscar Are you?
ryan Little advice? Take a day off from the whole jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels. James.
jo Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this.
gabe all right.
jo Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
jim No, was it good?
jo Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. Whose is this? darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah. a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?
darryl Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
jo Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2. 5 billion units of inventory. 2. 5 billion, Darryl? 2. 5 billion units of what?
darryl Paper material, ma'am.
jo Paper material?
darryl Pieces of paper.
dwight Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
jo Or what? You gonna shoot me?
dwight Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
jo I'll interview you right now.
dwight Okay.
jo Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
dwight It's complicated.
jo Yeah, but see. it's not.
phyllis I don't think we should tell her. angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
pam I'm a woman. I would want to know.
meredith Yeah, you gotta know.
kevin Okay, but if angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
oscar You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
phyllis You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
pam She does seem happy.
oscar You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
kevin We don't tell her.
pam Okay.
kelly Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
jo Okay.
kelly Uh. . can it be in private? Don't worry, it's not about you. As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
jo Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!
creed Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant.
jordan Who is our biggest client?
pam Uh, just put him through to me.
jordan Okay.
pam Hello! This is. the client.
creed It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
pam Yes.
creed Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
pam Great.
creed all right, thank you, bye-bye.
pam Thank you, bye-bye.
erin Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
jo Huh?
erin He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
jo No, send him in. Who is this?
gabe I have no idea.
jim Oh, I know this guy. Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay. " Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay. " Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
dwight Assistant Regional Manager.
jim Assistant to the Regional Manager.
dwight Assistant Regional Manager.
jim What is it?
dwight Assistant Regional Manager.
jim Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
jo I want to talk to dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. If he isn't here in sixty seconds.
dwight Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo. It's me. I'm Dwight.
jim No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then. he's the.
dwight Yeah.
jim Ohhhh!
gabe Very unprofessional, "Jacques. " Or, should I say, Dwight.
jo Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
dwight I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
jo all that for this job.
dwight Yes.
jo That's f***ing crazy. Get outta here. What a nutjob.
jim This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, "just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear. "
jo Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?
jim Finger Lakes guy is good. darryl is also very good.
jo Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?
gabe How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability.
jo And that's your unbiased opinion.
gabe Yes, it is.
jo So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
gabe Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was.
jo Gabe. ugh. you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
gabe That sounds like a promotion!
jo It's not. Let's get kelly in here to take his place.
jim Um. why Kelly?
jo 'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
jim Okay.
jo How'd my girl nellie do?
jim Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
jo She didn't mention it?
jim No.
jo Integrity move. I like it.
jim You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
jo Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
erin Ahh!
oscar Erin, what are you doing?
erin I've been turned into a puppet!
oscar Okay.
kevin Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
erin I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named angela turned me into a puppet!
kevin Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
erin And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
kevin It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me. but, if any kids are watching. A, B, and so forth. You know. . M-N-L-O, P. F.
erin I need the most special thing in the office.
dwight Silence?
erin A date with the best salesman. andy Bernard!
andy Hey, Erin.
erin Oh.
andy Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
erin I've done it all my life.
andy Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
andy Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but. when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't. seem to like it, like, Mad Men. or football. Let's not forget, erin chose gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. I would go for someone who's more. she's great, though.
angela Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
stanley I'll get over it.
angela I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and jim did your ironic wedding? Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
pam That was our dream wedding.
angela Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
pam I hope. you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
angela Hmm.
jim all right. Name.
dwight dwight Schrute.
jim Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. We will let you know.
dwight You have to interview me.
jim I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
dwight I demand more questions!
jim all right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
dwight Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
jim Yes.
dwight What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and. getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That's a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. all of my concerns are disappearing.
jim Thank you, Dwight.
dwight Thank you. You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting.
jim Well, that was quick.
kelly Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
jim He's not a real candidate.
kelly I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
jim You took the deal.
kelly Yeah, it was a great deal.
jim That's not okay.
kelly I don't know. dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
toby Well, we could try him out for a little while. and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in.
jim What is happening right now?
phyllis Is it true that you're making dwight the manager?
jim No, why would you think that?
phyllis He and kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
jim Okay. Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and dwight is definitely not the boss.
kelly That is correct. Actually, dwight is not the manager yet.
jim No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
dwight Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
jim Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
andy Tuna. You're completely sane.
jim Thank you.
andy Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
jim Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
kevin Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
jim I suppose I am.
kevin Okay. well what do 'I' want in a manager?. let me see. what do 'I' want?.
oscar I don't think he meant, that--
kevin So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
oscar Go ahead.
kevin What do 'I' want?. I'm looking for someone. who. Everyone is listening to me.
oscar Can I say. ?
jim Yes.
oscar I think it should be Darryl.
jim Okay.
dwight What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
oscar Kelly's on your side.
kelly I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
andy Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
ryan I want an outsider.
jim Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
ryan No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
pam A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
ryan No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
pam No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
ryan Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
ryan I got away with. everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me. when I'm in the mood. to be led.
meredith I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
jim Hey! Hey! Hey!
meredith Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny pen1s. Are you happy? Let's hire that guy!
andy She may have a point there. would a small pen1s work? Small-to-moderate.
gabe Gotta catch a plane.
pam Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we. we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
gabe Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
kelly You are not leaving without giving me a hug. Ughh.
gabe Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
kelly I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
gabe There are plenty of people who love touching me. I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
kevin Later, man.
all Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.
ryan Take care, man.
dwight We're gonna miss you, Gabe.
andy Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you. and I won't make any changes.
erin I see it. I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of and facing, and I'm like.
phyllis Yeah. Yeah, andy would be wonderful as boss. erin made a good point.
phyllis No, we're not related. I got the call. But. I'll tell her some other day.
jim What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
angela Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
toby No, no. . no. Sorry. We cut kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk.
kevin Exactly.
darryl Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
jada Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?
darryl Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
jada I don't know if he'd be a good manager , but he's a really great dad!
darryl Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go.
phyllis It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
jim What? No, no, it's not a vote.
phyllis Then what was this all about?
jim I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
kelly I don't care. They can just vote.
jim No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? What the hell happened out there?
andy Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
nellie This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think. I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
darryl Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin. especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
fred No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of. Vance Refrigeration.
merv Honestly, I think I. I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point. I was supposed to start another job today.
robert I will get offered the job. That's a. call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause. while they wait to hear my response, and then. my response. Finger Lakes
guy I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.
dwight I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or. I don't know. Something always works out.
creed You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
pam Is that right?
creed I think you two should meet.
