andy_bernard Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
andy_bernard Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
stanley_hudson Holiday wishes.
andy_bernard What's that, Stanley?
stanley_hudson We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
andy_bernard It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
stanley_hudson I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
jim_halpert I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.
stanley_hudson I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
meredith_palmer What is the status on my wish?
andy_bernard Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
dwight_schrute What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
andy_bernard That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
dwight_schrute Where? Dark side or light side?
andy_bernard Light side.
dwight_schrute Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
andy_bernard As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Andy.
andy_bernard So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.
jim_halpert She's not your grandmother, is she?
andy_bernard Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
jim_halpert Yeah.
andy_bernard Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
creed_bratton That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
andy_bernard Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
erin_hannon I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
kelly_kapoor I just want you to know that I will be mean to Jessica if you want me to be.
erin_hannon Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
erin_hannon That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
robert_california Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati.
kelly_kapoor Eww, what is that?
robert_california The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts.
kelly_kapoor Cool.
kevin_malone Hey, man.
robert_california Hey! Oh!
kevin_malone How ya holdin' up...because of your wife leaving you?
oscar_martinez Kevin?
robert_california I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.
kevin_malone Yeah.
robert_california It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.
andy_bernard Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
robert_california I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop.....ah, heartbreaking.
andy_bernard Oh, thank you.
andy_bernard Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
dwight_schrute Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
jim_halpert It wasn't me.
andy_bernard It wasn't either of you.
jim_halpert Kathy wants to leave our clump?
andy_bernard Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
dwight_schrute I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.
jim_halpert Ow, What are you doing?
andy_bernard Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
jim_halpert Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
andy_bernard Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.
jim_halpert What was that?
dwight_schrute What is it?
andy_bernard Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
jim_halpert Can't do that.
dwight_schrute No, absolutely not.
andy_bernard You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
jessica Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?
erin_hannon Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. I'm Erin.
jessica Oh! Oof!
erin_hannon Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
jessica Oh.
andy_bernard My ex is meeting my s*x....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your pen1s...that's just part of it.
andy_bernard Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my pen1s. Hi.
jessica Hi.
andy_bernard Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
erin_hannon Wow.
andy_bernard Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
jessica Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.
erin_hannon Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
andy_bernard What?
jessica Oh.
erin_hannon Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.
andy_bernard Oh no.
jessica Ah..
andy_bernard Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.
jessica Spontaneous scoliosis.
erin_hannon Oh.
darryl_philbin This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
val Thank you.
darryl_philbin Alright.
val Alright.
darryl_philbin Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
val Isn't that just for popsicles?
darryl_philbin Popsicles?
val Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
nate Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. I, in my, I...
darryl_philbin Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
nate You had me at "clookies." I can't wait to find out what they are.
val What should I wear?
darryl_philbin Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
nate I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
jim_halpert Ah... I'm gonna s-
jim_halpert Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.
robert_california Erin, what can I get for you?
erin_hannon Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
robert_california Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!
ryan_howard Yes!
oscar_martinez Yes!
ryan_howard Will do.
robert_california The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.
phyllis_vance One, two three!
kevin_malone Yes.
erin_hannon OK.
robert_california Mmm. Wow.
erin_hannon Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
robert_california Jiminey Christmas indeed.
erin_hannon Hit 'er up.
robert_california Oh.
kevin_malone Oh yes.
ryan_howard Whoo!
erin_hannon Yeah!
oscar_martinez Wow.
jim_halpert Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
jim_halpert So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
dwight_schrute Boom!
ryan_howard But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed... whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do...
kevin_malone Good cookie.
darryl_philbin I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
val OK.
darryl_philbin I thought you'd wear a sweater.
val Since when does a sweater mean "dressed up"? Am I your grandson?
darryl_philbin Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
val As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
erin_hannon I want.. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. and then I want my nap!
stanley_hudson That's right.
erin_hannon Whoo! Thank you.
robert_california She, she is remarkable.
andy_bernard Edgy impressions.
erin_hannon Thank you.
andy_bernard How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
erin_hannon A thousand.
andy_bernard Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
erin_hannon Maybe you should mind your own business. Just kidding!
dwight_schrute Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
toby_flenderson Oh my god.
dwight_schrute Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
jim_halpert I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
dwight_schrute Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
jim_halpert Hmm...
toby_flenderson You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
toby_flenderson Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist.
angela_martin Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
toby_flenderson No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
dwight_schrute Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
jim_halpert Nice try, this is ridiculous.
dwight_schrute Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
jim_halpert Three times.
dwight_schrute You see?
andy_bernard Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
jim_halpert Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
toby_flenderson Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand...
kelly_kapoor Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
jim_halpert OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
dwight_schrute Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
angela_martin No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
jim_halpert Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
dwight_schrute Come down right away!
jim_halpert Uh, I don't know, let me ask. Uh, were you quilled?
dwight_schrute Yes, I was quilled.
jim_halpert And what's it's name?
dwight_schrute Henrietta.
jim_halpert Oops.
andy_bernard What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
erin_hannon Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? And you both have such beautiful hair.
jessica Thank you.
erin_hannon I hope you guys get married....and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
andy_bernard OK!
erin_hannon And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. Ah! OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say "get a drink".
jessica That's uh, that's the girl you dated.
andy_bernard Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...
jessica No, she, she seems fine.
andy_bernard Yeah, uh, excuse me.
jessica OK.
andy_bernard Yep. Hey!
erin_hannon Hey.
andy_bernard Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
erin_hannon Every martini has an olive.
andy_bernard OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
kevin_malone I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
erin_hannon Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
andy_bernard Ah, OK.
erin_hannon It's about you.
andy_bernard That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
erin_hannon It's that I wish Jessica was dead.
andy_bernard You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
erin_hannon I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground...with worms coming out of her mouth.
andy_bernard Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
erin_hannon Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar?
kevin_malone Hey.
erin_hannon Hey.
kevin_malone So, there was talk of oatmeal.
phyllis_vance You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
val Yeah. Thanks.
andy_bernard I swear...
jessica Did you not...
andy_bernard I was too embarrassed!
jim_halpert Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
phyllis_vance Is that Cici?
jim_halpert Yes. It is.
andy_bernard Um.
phyllis_vance That's awful.
andy_bernard Cici is Jim's daughter.
jessica Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
jim_halpert I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
oscar_martinez Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
jim_halpert I don't-
andy_bernard I know who did this....Dwight.
phyllis_vance Dwight?
jim_halpert Yeah.
andy_bernard Dwight.
oscar_martinez No!
phyllis_vance He should pay.
andy_bernard Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
jim_halpert O...K.
andy_bernard It's, I mean.
jim_halpert Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
oscar_martinez That's no accident.
jim_halpert Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
phyllis_vance What?
oscar_martinez What?
jim_halpert I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
dwight_schrute Enough of this garbage. This is Christmas. Hi-yah!!!!! Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
jim_halpert You alright, Santa?
andy_bernard You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
jim_halpert Yes.
andy_bernard Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
jim_halpert Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
andy_bernard No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.
jim_halpert OK.
andy_bernard By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
jim_halpert Alright. I will definitely do that.
andy_bernard Alright, I'll tell Dwight.
jim_halpert You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
andy_bernard Christmas miracles do happen.
jim_halpert Yes. They totally do.
ryan_howard You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
kelly_kapoor Well help me, OK? Just, uh take...
ryan_howard I'm trying but you need to-
erin_hannon Hey.
kelly_kapoor Yo.
erin_hannon Game on.
kelly_kapoor On it.
jessica I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful...
kelly_kapoor Jessica, did you just fart?
kelly_kapoor And that, is how it's done.
erin_hannon I would like another alcohol.
robert_california Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar.
oscar_martinez What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
robert_california Your heart is broken. So is mine.
erin_hannon And...
robert_california And what?
erin_hannon And you have any advice or anything?
robert_california No my god.
erin_hannon ...Help me feel better...
robert_california I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice....I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
nate When you do your makeup,
jessica Uh huh.
nate How long you, does it take usually? Cause...
jessica Um, it ta-, um it depends.
toby_flenderson .....Chad Flendermen's kryptonite.
creed_bratton Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
darryl_philbin Hi.
jessica I'll see you at home?
andy_bernard OK great.
jessica OK
andy_bernard Perfect.
jessica Bye ...I still don't get why you can't just call her a cab and pay for it.
andy_bernard I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.
jessica Oh
meredith_palmer Either he drives or I drive. Now I'm drunk and mad.
jessica OK Bye.
andy_bernard OK, bye. Alright Meredith,
meredith_palmer Thank you Santa.
andy_bernard You bet.
andy_bernard Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,
andy_bernard Let's go, let's go.
meredith_palmer I know, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
andy_bernard Hang on.
meredith_palmer Alright.

meredith_palmer It's my valuables!

meredith_palmer This is my treasures, no they're my treasures!
andy_bernard You're a hoarder. My god!
meredith_palmer No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
andy_bernard Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.
dwight_schrute What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
meredith_palmer Where are we? This ain't my street.
andy_bernard Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.
meredith_palmer Ah, this is the posh part of town, huh?
andy_bernard Oh my god.
meredith_palmer Wonder what a studio condo would cost in this neighborhood?
andy_bernard Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.
robert_california Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.
erin_hannon Thank you, goodnight.
meredith_palmer What are you smiling for? You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
andy_bernard I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.
meredith_palmer Ow! Take it easy.
andy_bernard Whoo.
dwight_schrute Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
oscar_martinez Dwight.
dwight_schrute Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
jim_halpert Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. I got nothin'.
