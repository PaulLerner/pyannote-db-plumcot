ny_corporate_employee Pam, line three.
pam_beesly Okay, thanks.
pam_beesly New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.
pam_beesly Hey.
michael_scott Paaam-o-laaaaaa...
pam_beesly Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.
pam_beesly Hey Michael.
michael_scott Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
michael_scott Hey.
holly_flax Hello.
michael_scott That was really fun last night.
holly_flax Yeah, it was nice.
michael_scott I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
holly_flax Oh, that would be great. You need that.
michael_scott Yeah?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott Oh really?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott Well...
holly_flax It would help.
michael_scott I, uh... I let her win.
holly_flax No, he didn't.
michael_scott So, when, um, can I see you again?
holly_flax Um, tonight, I'm free tonight. Is that too eager?
michael_scott No.
holly_flax I don't care, free tonight.
michael_scott Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. Because I am busy taking you out.
holly_flax Oh, I just remembered, I can't tonight.
michael_scott Why?
holly_flax I'm going out with you.
michael_scott Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...
holly_flax No more.
michael_scott Tonight's so...
holly_flax No more.
michael_scott Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
holly_flax Thank you, you too.
michael_scott You're welcome.
michael_scott In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have s*x. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having s*x with me I'll know for sure.
andy_bernard That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
dwight_schrute You set a date?
andy_bernard J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
phyllis_vance What are you making?
dwight_schrute A knife.
phyllis_vance You're making a knife with a knife?
dwight_schrute You got a better way?
phyllis_vance You want to talk about it?
dwight_schrute About what?
phyllis_vance You know I know. You know they know.
dwight_schrute I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
holly_flax Oh, the mall could be fun.
michael_scott Yeah.
holly_flax We could go to the food court and get different foods. You could get Chicken Teriyaki. I could get a hot dog.
michael_scott Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after. Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?
holly_flax ...Hell yeah.
michael_scott Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
holly_flax Yeah, that's good.
michael_scott Probably get soup or something light.
phyllis_vance Hi.
dwight_schrute She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
phyllis_vance It's nice to learn new things.
dwight_schrute I was talking to myself.
phyllis_vance Okay.
dwight_schrute I just don't get it.
phyllis_vance What don't you get?
dwight_schrute Why is she marrying Andy?
phyllis_vance Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
dwight_schrute That's really fattening.
phyllis_vance No, it's lettuce.
holly_flax It's time to go.
michael_scott No. No. Reservations are at 8 00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
holly_flax You're crazy, go crazy.
holly_flax Oh, I forgot my keys.
michael_scott Do you need 'em?
holly_flax Yeah, lets go grab them.
michael_scott All right.
holly_flax Oh, after vous.
michael_scott Thank vous. What? Oh!
holly_flax I didn't forget my keys, I just didn't want to make out with you in front of the cameras. Do you think they can hear us?
michael_scott Not if we turn these dials all the way down. Now they can't hear us at all.
holly_flax Oh, good.
michael_scott We're totally alone.
angela_martin Yes, that's correct. I need to cancel checks from 10,001 to 90,000.
oscar_martinez Great, they stole my laptop.
kevin_malone Yeah, well, they stole my surge protector.
oscar_martinez How does that even compare?
kevin_malone Oscar, I'm now going to be prone to surges.
michael_scott Oh, my God, what happened?
jim_halpert We were robbed last night.
dwight_schrute Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
holly_flax Can I talk to you for a second?
michael_scott Yeah. Oh... oh!
holly_flax That wasn't us, right? I mean... you remembered to lock the doors?
michael_scott No, did you?
holly_flax Michael I think this is our fault.
michael_scott Oh, no, my God.
holly_flax Oh...
michael_scott Oh my God!
michael_scott So much for s*x without consequences.
pam_beesly You are such a dork! Shots!
jim_halpert So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3 00 in the morning.
pam_beesly I'm not drunk.
jim_halpert I'm on minute six of this message.
pam_beesly Okay, I do not sound like that.
stanley_hudson on phone You can take the girl out of Philly...
pam_beesly Scranton.
jim_halpert The future mother of my children.
angela_martin I never felt safe here.
andy_bernard You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.
angela_martin I would very much like that.
andy_bernard Yeah?
angela_martin Yeah.
andy_bernard Consider yourself... at home!
dwight_schrute Ugh.
dwight_schrute Get in.
phyllis_vance Where are we going?
dwight_schrute I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
phyllis_vance Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
dwight_schrute Are you sure that's going to work?
phyllis_vance It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
dwight_schrute Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...
holly_flax How's everyone doing? My door is always open if anyone wants to talk.
oscar_martinez I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.
creed_bratton Nobody steals from Creed Bratton and gets away with it. The last person to do this disappeared. His name? Creed Bratton.
michael_scott We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?
michael_scott To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.
phyllis_vance I think it's a fun idea.
michael_scott Thank you.
phyllis_vance We could auction off things we do for each other like cleaning or tennis lessons. My sorority did it all the time.
michael_scott Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
phyllis_vance Move on, Michael.
michael_scott Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
oscar_martinez So, in order to recoup the value of items we liked, we have to spend more money on things we don't want. Who would ever come to this?
michael_scott I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
jim_halpert Do you need us for any of this?
michael_scott Do I?
holly_flax Michael scored the big ticket item. Springsteen tickets! The boss scored the boss.
michael_scott Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.
holly_flax He knows how to get things. He got me.
michael_scott Whoa!
holly_flax Sorry.
michael_scott Twice. ... Right?
holly_flax Mm-hmm.
michael_scott Mm-hmm.
holly_flax Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
angela_martin I think you have me confused with another person.
dwight_schrute I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6 14 PM. 6 14!
angela_martin I heard you.
michael_scott Pump it up! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Pump up the volume. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Springsteen. And welcome to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D. Crime Reduces Innocence Makes Everyone Angry I Declare. It is not known how many office robberies occur every second because there is no Wikipedia entry for office robbery statistics. However, tonight, its victims, are standing together and standing strong in the form of song, cooking lessons, and hugs. Really Phyllis? You're auctioning a hug? Okay, so with no further ado, lights, camera, auction! Take it away Bruce!
darryl_philbin Mike gave me a list of his top ten Springsteen songs. Three of them were Huey Lewis and the News. One was Tracy Chapman, Fast Car. And my personal favorite, Short People.
michael_scott Okay, this is the moment that you have all been waiting for. Our first item up for bids tonight is something that I consider to be very boss indeed. It is a Yoga lesson from Holly Flax! Yoga! And I would like to start the bidding off at 300 dollars. 300 dollars do I hear 300 dollars? 300 dollars. Hey, batter batter batter, hey batter, swing batter, 300 dollars, 300 dollars, 300 dollars. Anybody, 300 dollars. 400 dollars. Who wants for 400- Do I see somebody in the back? Is there somebody in the back? Do I see somebody in the back? 400-450 Sold! For 300 dollars to me! What the hell is that?
phyllis_vance It's the only gavel I could find.
michael_scott It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
darryl_philbin Hey Mike, do my thing.
michael_scott Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
darryl_philbin Mike, you can't do that. It's conflict of interest.
jim_halpert 5 dollars.
darryl_philbin Sold! To Jim.
michael_scott Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says "Creed."

dwight_schrute Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
phyllis_vance Now you move on.
dwight_schrute Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
phyllis_vance Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
dwight_schrute Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
phyllis_vance Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
dwight_schrute Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. And you slap like a girl.
dwight_schrute What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me.
roy_anderson What's going on with Pam?
jim_halpert Oh, she's good actually.
roy_anderson Yeah?
jim_halpert She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
roy_anderson Really?

roy_anderson Congrats, man.
jim_halpert Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
roy_anderson So Pam's happy?
jim_halpert Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8 00 AM.
roy_anderson Wow.

michael_scott Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them-
holly_flax The Springsteen tickets seemed too good to be true. But, a lot of Michael seems too good to be true. So far it's all true. But yeah, those tickets, really seemed too good to be true.
david_wallace Wallace No, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.
