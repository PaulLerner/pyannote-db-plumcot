dwight_schrute You should get one of these.
jim_halpert No. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
jim_halpert Done.
dwight_schrute This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. Sorry.
jim_halpert S'ok.
dwight_schrute Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x.
jim_halpert You're not having s*x.
dwight_schrute Plus, improves your reflexes see, I would have caught that.
jim_halpert Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
dwight_schrute It's only twenty-five bucks.
jim_halpert Wow. Um, ok.
michael_scott Pam, could I see you in my office?
pam_beesly It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect.
michael_scott Pam, you're trustworthy-
pam_beesly Thank you.
michael_scott And a woman-
pam_beesly Oh, no.
michael_scott And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon." First impressions?
pam_beesly Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.
michael_scott My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual.
michael_scott "I guess I missed you." I guess I missed you. So, she misses me?
pam_beesly She missed you.
michael_scott But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
pam_beesly I have one idea of what it means.
michael_scott Ok. Yeah, what, what?
pam_beesly Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.
michael_scott Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-
pam_beesly Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
michael_scott Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
pam_beesly Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.
michael_scott Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you".
dwight_schrute Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review.
jim_halpert Ok.
dwight_schrute Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
jim_halpert We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
dwight_schrute Oh, yes, we do.
jim_halpert No, we don't.
dwight_schrute Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
jim_halpert Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
dwight_schrute Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?
jim_halpert I win.
dwight_schrute Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid.
jim_halpert Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
dwight_schrute Uh, duh.
jim_halpert Duh.
jim_halpert Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.
stanley_hudson Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.
michael_scott Really?
stanley_hudson Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses.
michael_scott God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry.
stanley_hudson Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact.
michael_scott No kidding.
stanley_hudson It's all about my bonus.
pam_beesly Michael and Jan definitely made out.
jim_halpert Ohh...
pam_beesly Maybe more.
jim_halpert Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'.
pam_beesly Oh, yea!
michael_scott Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn.
angela_martin I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.
pam_beesly Michael?
michael_scott Yeah?
pam_beesly Jan's on the phone for you.
michael_scott Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
michael_scott Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. Yeah?
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?
jan_levinson I am returning your many calls.
michael_scott Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
jan_levinson No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.
michael_scott Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
jan_levinson Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.
michael_scott Oh.
jan_levinson I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.
michael_scott Been thinking about you.
jan_levinson Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.
michael_scott Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Yep.
jan_levinson Are the cameras with you...
michael_scott No.
jan_levinson ...in your office?
michael_scott They are not. Yes, they are. That's my girlfriend.
kevin_malone I heard they made out and had s*x.
oscar_martinez No, they just made out. That's it.
kevin_malone Well, I heard they made out and had s*x.
angela_martin Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.
kevin_malone Romances?
michael_scott Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A "Michael-idea" folder?
pam_beesly Sorry.
michael_scott That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.
pam_beesly What suggestion box?
michael_scott The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?
pam_beesly Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.
michael_scott Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
ryan_howard Don't you mean constructive criticism?
michael_scott What did I say?
kelly_kapoor You said "constructive complements"; that doesn't make any sense.
michael_scott Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?
jim_halpert Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11 15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...
dwight_schrute Saturday.
jim_halpert ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
jan_levinson We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye. Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?
pam_beesly Sure.
michael_scott Hi, Jan. How are you?
jan_levinson I'm good; how are you?
michael_scott Good to see you.
jan_levinson Nice to see you.
michael_scott Ok. Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here.
jan_levinson Can we please go in your office?
michael_scott Yep, right after you. Apres-vous. No calls.
kevin_malone Oooo.
michael_scott Alright .
jan_levinson Thank you.
michael_scott It's nice to see you.
jan_levinson Nice to see you too, Michael.
michael_scott Really?
jan_levinson Not like that.
michael_scott Oh, well.
jan_levinson You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.
michael_scott Alright.
jan_levinson Period.
michael_scott Yep.
jan_levinson Do we understand each other.
michael_scott Absolutely.
michael_scott I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because "Oh, I regret that." But, "Wait, I'm still gonna call you." But, but, "We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job." But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business.
jan_levinson So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?
michael_scott No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual. We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?
jan_levinson No.
michael_scott This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.
jan_levinson Fine.
michael_scott Are you wearing a new perfume today?
jan_levinson How is that a business question?
michael_scott Well, you're wearing it at the office. And it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.
jan_levinson Please don't smell me, Michael.
pam_beesly Hey, Jim.
jim_halpert Hey, how's it goin'?
pam_beesly Oh my God, did you see "The Apprentice" last night?
jim_halpert Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
pam_beesly Can you believe who Trump fired?
jim_halpert No, that was unbelievable.
dwight_schrute Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?
pam_beesly You didn't see it?
dwight_schrute No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
michael_scott I don't understand- Hold on. Sorry. Yes, Pam.
pam_beesly Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.
michael_scott I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
pam_beesly You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.
michael_scott I did not, not, not use those words.
jan_levinson Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting is it happening right now?
michael_scott No, it's in like ten minutes.
pam_beesly Everyone's waiting in the conference room.
jan_levinson Great. Very good.
michael_scott Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?"
dwight_schrute What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
kelly_kapoor I thought you read these every week.
michael_scott Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally.
dwight_schrute It happens occasionally.
michael_scott And, um, one down. Next suggestion "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
jan_levinson That sounds serious, Michael.
michael_scott Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
dwight_schrute Tom?
michael_scott Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
phyllis_vance Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago. Tom? Pow.
michael_scott Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.
dwight_schrute Next suggestion.
michael_scott Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."
dwight_schrute You need to do something about your B.O.
michael_scott Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
toby_flenderson Aren't the suggestions meant for you?
michael_scott Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
creed_bratton Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring.
michael_scott Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
dwight_schrute You need-
michael_scott Ok.
dwight_schrute To do something about-
michael_scott Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
angela_martin Sometimes you talk to us real close.
michael_scott Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-
angela_martin Well, when you have coffee breath-
michael_scott I'll work on that-
angela_martin It's hard.
michael_scott Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
dwight_schrute Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
michael_scott Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
dwight_schrute Next suggestion.
michael_scott "Don't sl-", ok, that's blank Don't, just put it-
dwight_schrute "Don't sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
jan_levinson I can't, I can't-
michael_scott I don't understand why you're so upset.
jan_levinson Please sit down.
michael_scott Let me ask you-
jan_levinson You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.
michael_scott Ok, let me ask you this.
jan_levinson Please, sit yourself down.
michael_scott Let me ask you something.
jan_levinson What, Michael.
michael_scott Where did you get your outfit?
dwight_schrute You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise! Yes! Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!
michael_scott I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.
jan_levinson Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same
michael_scott Look-
dwight_schrute Michael?
michael_scott Oh my God...
dwight_schrute I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out?
jan_levinson No, Dwight; come in.
dwight_schrute Great.
michael_scott What do you want Dwight?
dwight_schrute I am ready for my performance review.
michael_scott Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye.
jan_levinson Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?
michael_scott You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
dwight_schrute Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
michael_scott Why on earth would we give you a raise?
dwight_schrute That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word dedication. I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays.
michael_scott You do? How do you get in?
dwight_schrute I have a copy of your key.
jan_levinson That's a serious offense!
michael_scott That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.
jan_levinson Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
dwight_schrute I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
michael_scott Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
dwight_schrute For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
michael_scott That was deer!? Gross, oh!
dwight_schrute You liked it!
michael_scott Oh, did not!
dwight_schrute Jan, have you ever had deer?
jan_levinson No.
dwight_schrute It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
michael_scott What do you say, Jan?
jan_levinson Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.
michael_scott Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
jan_levinson Thank you, Dwight.
jan_levinson Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. Do you have a light?
dwight_schrute And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of".
michael_scott That's from Superman?
dwight_schrute Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
pam_beesly Do you think Michael and Jan actually...
jim_halpert I don't really wanna picture it. But thank you, Pam.
pam_beesly How do you come back from that?
jim_halpert Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know. Especially working together.
pam_beesly No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?
jim_halpert Oh-
pam_beesly As a human being.
jim_halpert Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
jan_levinson I'm heading back to New York; Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.
michael_scott Wait.
jan_levinson 'K?
michael_scott Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
jan_levinson Michael, now is not the time or the place.
michael_scott Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
jan_levinson No, I am saying we are never having this conversation.
michael_scott Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
jan_levinson Never, for me, always means 'never ever ever.'
michael_scott I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
jan_levinson Michael, it has nothing-
michael_scott Am I too short?
jan_levinson With your looks, ok? It's your personality. I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and, and, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way, and, and I don't agree about the b.o., but you are very, very inconsiderate.
michael_scott Really?
jan_levinson Really. You're, you're, you're a great guy, ok?
michael_scott I appreciate that, thank you.
jan_levinson And you were very sweet, and you stayed up with me and talked with me, cried with me, and I appreciate that-
michael_scott No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-
jan_levinson At this time in my life. I just am not in the place right now where I'm looking for a relationship, so we can still work together, we can still be friends but... ok?
michael_scott So my looks have nothing to do with it?
jan_levinson Ohhh, God.
michael_scott Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now. And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am. And that is all I needed; I'm good. I can go home now.
michael_scott Hey, it's 12 20; where the hell's Dwight?
jim_halpert Ummm... no idea.
michael_scott Never missed a day, my ass.
pam_beesly Thank you.
dwight_schrute I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
