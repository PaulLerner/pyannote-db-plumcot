jim_halpert It's kind of blurry. That's better. Question. What kind of bear is best?
dwight_schrute That's a ridiculous question.
jim_halpert False. Black bear.
dwight_schrute Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---
jim_halpert Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
dwight_schrute Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
jim_halpert Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses. Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that's a grand total of... eleven dollars.
dwight_schrute You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!
jim_halpert ... MICHAEL!
dwight_schrute Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!
pam_beesly Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?
jim_halpert Absolutely. I couldn't be more sorry about this.
phyllis_vance I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
stanley_hudson I am upset. Don't I sound upset?
michael_scott It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
michael_scott We have a crisis. Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock. Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing... unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like. I've never been a fan.
michael_scott Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime.
dwight_schrute Cri-Man-Squa?
michael_scott Crisis Management Squad.
ryan_howard F and C, doubletime?
michael_scott Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?
jim_halpert One more. Why are you talking like that?
michael_scott To save time, Jim.
karen_filippelli Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
pam_beesly Yeah, she has a good point. I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
michael_scott You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?
creed_bratton Here.
michael_scott Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
creed_bratton Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill. And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
michael_scott We have a lot of angry customers out there. This puts us at threat level midnight. Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
oscar_martinez That's really not our job.
michael_scott Midnight, Oscar! Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first.
angela_martin Kelly's training us?
kelly_kapoor This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. This day is bananas! B-A-N-A-
angela_martin I don't have a headache. I'm just preparing.
michael_scott Jim, big fire in your house. Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper. Went home to all the kids.
jim_halpert Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
michael_scott No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person.
jim_halpert All right.
michael_scott I want you to bring a partner.
ryan_howard I'll go.
michael_scott No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go.
andy_bernard William Dolittle at your service. A.K.A., Will Do.
jim_halpert Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
michael_scott No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
dwight_schrute Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"
pam_beesly We're having a press conference?
michael_scott No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
dwight_schrute Not!
michael_scott Here's the thing. When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference. Alert the media, and then you control the story. Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you. That's what happened to O.J.
michael_scott I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology. The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
jim_halpert Oh, did the press ask for a story?
michael_scott Here is your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client. Some companies still know how business is done." Okay? Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go!
creed_bratton Yes, hello. Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton. I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there. And I'm trying to remember who it was. Mm-hmm. Who wasn't there last week? Debbie Brown. And which day was that? Wednesday, the eleventh. Perfect.
creed_bratton The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job. I will do whatever it takes to survive. Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
kelly_kapoor Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people. But guess what? From now on, you guys are no longer losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
oscar_martinez I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
kelly_kapoor I know, right? Probably a lot.
angela_martin Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
kelly_kapoor OK, Angela. I love your enthusiasm. All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say "Customer Service, this is Kelly!" Except don't say "Kelly," say your own name. Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name. Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
kevin_malone Oh! Can I be Australian, mate?
kelly_kapoor Absolutely!
kevin_malone 'ello, mate!
kelly_kapoor I like ice cream! I need a boyfriend.
kevin_malone I like ice cream too, mate. Alligators and dingo babies.
andy_bernard Beer me!
jim_halpert What's that?
andy_bernard Hand me that water. I always say "Beer me." Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. So how's what's-her-name?
jim_halpert You know her name.
andy_bernard Who, Karen? Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends. Mmm. How's the apartment hangin'?
jim_halpert It's fine.
andy_bernard Nice. Check out this sunshine, man. Global warming, right? Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
jim_halpert What about music? Do you have any music?
andy_bernard Uh, yeah. Should have said so. Rha-dah-dah-dah! Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul. I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay. Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
jim_halpert I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
andy_bernard Your call, dude. My girlfriend made an awesome mix. Beer me that disc.
jim_halpert Lord, beer me strength.
andy_bernard So, Tuna. When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
jim_halpert Did that really need to be said?
andy_bernard Well not everything a guy says needs to be said. Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
andy_bernard Whoa! What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
jim_halpert Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
andy_bernard No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
jim_halpert Which one... is she?
andy_bernard The one in the green hoodie.
jim_halpert Wow.
andy_bernard I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
jim_halpert No, I don't think so.
andy_bernard She's like, probably a tutor.
jim_halpert Nope.
andy_bernard She probably a t--
jim_halpert No.
andy_bernard Sh---
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
dwight_schrute On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair.
dwight_schrute First rule in road-side beet sales Put the most attractive beets on top. The ones that make you pull the car over and go, "Wow, I need this beet right now." Those are the money beets.
dwight_schrute Hey! Look sharp! Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute.
chad_lite Lite Hi, uh---
dwight_schrute And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
chad_lite Lite Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life."
dwight_schrute And "Breaking Corporate News."
chad_lite Lite And obits.
dwight_schrute Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance.
chad_lite Lite Oh...
dwight_schrute Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
chad_lite Lite Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---
dwight_schrute Great.
jim_halpert Oh, Andy. You know what? We don't have a lot of time, so we should probably...
andy_bernard Jamie!
jim_halpert Andy--- Ohh...
andy_bernard What are you doing here?
jamie Andy?
andy_bernard Are you a student here?
jamie Oh... yeah...
andy_bernard You never told me you were in high-school!
jamie This is weird. I... gotta go to Spanish.
andy_bernard OH MY GOD!
jim_halpert Oh my God.
andy_bernard I had no idea.
jim_halpert Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
andy_bernard Huh... We didn't do anything illegal. Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
kevin_malone Sir, yes, you have a valid point. I'm sorry. No, I am so sorry.
oscar_martinez Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
angela_martin Excuse me? Well, I don't see how that's our fault. And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me.
kelly_kapoor OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing sooo good. Look, you have so many good qualities, that the one that you might wanna work on is, apologizing?
creed_bratton When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
dwight_schrute Emergency dentist appointment.
creed_bratton Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu. I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there. We would have caught this.
pam_beesly Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call. I'm so sorry. Bye.
barbara_allen Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott.
michael_scott Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client. Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.
michael_scott And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
dwight_schrute You look good in this.
michael_scott So, let us consider this matter ended.
barbara_allen Well it isn't ended. I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.
michael_scott I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.
barbara_allen I don't accept your apology. The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
michael_scott Well, we are extremely sorry.
barbara_allen I don't accept.
high_school_principal Official I'll be with you in a moment.
jim_halpert All right.
andy_bernard Who was that guy she was talking to? At her locker.
jim_halpert Not important. Because you're not dating her. Because it's a felony.
andy_bernard But who was that guy?
jim_halpert Probably another high-school student.
high_school_principal Official The issue with the watermark is very serious.
jim_halpert Absolutely.
high_school_principal Official We teach our students that character counts.
jim_halpert And you should.
high_school_principal Official But---
andy_bernard Pfft. You don't teach it well enough. One of your students is a bitch.
jim_halpert Andy... is having a real rough day today.
andy_bernard I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook. A full page, two words---
jim_halpert "Good luck."
andy_bernard That's not what I had in mind.
kelly_kapoor Ask where he's from.
angela_martin Where are you from? Ohio? That's nice. So what do you want? He's upset about the watermark.
kelly_kapoor OK, great. Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
angela_martin It was an unfortunate error. We're fixing it. And you already got your money back...
kelly_kapoor And you're sorry.
angela_martin ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. I think he had Tourette's or something!
michael_scott We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
barbara_allen Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.
michael_scott The watermark... it's a one time thing.
barbara_allen I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having s*x?
dwight_schrute May I point out that the s*x appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.
michael_scott OK...
dwight_schrute I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having s*x in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
michael_scott What... can I do, for you?
barbara_allen I, for starters, I think that you should resign.
michael_scott Well... OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---
barbara_allen You're the head---
michael_scott The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
barbara_allen You're the head of the company!
michael_scott I'm the head of the company?!
barbara_allen Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---
michael_scott No, I'm a regional manager---
barbara_allen And so you should lose your job!
michael_scott No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!
barbara_allen Fine.
michael_scott That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
barbara_allen Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute It's non-transferable...
michael_scott Doesn't matter. Out please!
barbara_allen I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.
michael_scott Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! Did you get all that?
chad_lite Lite Everything.
michael_scott We gotta do something. This is spinning out of control, Pam. This is just, not...
pam_beesly It's just the Scranton Times...
michael_scott No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
pam_beesly You know what? I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
michael_scott You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two. Do you know what this is for?
pam_beesly Yes.
pam_beesly Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. He says he needs a woman's touch.
michael_scott OK, I think that's good.
michael_scott "Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."
dwight_schrute Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
michael_scott That's how devoted I am to this job.
dwight_schrute I'm just saying...
michael_scott I know.
dwight_schrute They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.
michael_scott I understand that, Dwight.
dwight_schrute You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
michael_scott Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?
dwight_schrute Cut.
michael_scott So I'll know where---
pam_beesly Cut.
michael_scott I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
pam_beesly Cut.
michael_scott OK, ready?
angela_martin Kevin, what's four plus seven?
kevin_malone Eleven.
angela_martin Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
kevin_malone Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations. Oooh, yes. Facial.
oscar_martinez Yes.
angela_martin You two are apes.
oscar_martinez I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
angela_martin I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
kevin_malone Oh, but you still said "I'm sorry."
angela_martin I called you morons.
kevin_malone Still said it.
oscar_martinez Still said it, so...
michael_scott Five, four, three. "There is no way, I will resign. It wouldn't be fair. Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me. Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway. If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me. They're trying to make me an escape goat. If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it. The F-word. You have one day."
pam_beesly One day for what?
michael_scott That's... they always give an ultimatum.
pam_beesly OK.
michael_scott Good, cut?
pam_beesly Cut. That was your best apology video ever.
michael_scott Thought so too.
creed_bratton Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown. I thought maybe you'd like to sign it. Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her. She's got some children.
creed_bratton I feel terrible about Debbie Brown. She got fired because of Dwight. So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times. Why do bad things always happen to the good people? It's tragic. Just tragic.
jim_halpert You want music?
andy_bernard I don't care.
jim_halpert Come on man, just give it a couple days. I think you'll be all right.
andy_bernard Yeah.
jim_halpert A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
andy_bernard You know what--- I don't---
jim_halpert A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
andy_bernard Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
jim_halpert A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
andy_bernard Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
jim_halpert A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
andy_bernard Sweet.
dwight_schrute Pam.
pam_beesly Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today.
dwight_schrute Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
karen_filippelli Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.
dwight_schrute Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
jim_halpert Do you?
karen_filippelli No.
jim_halpert OK.
karen_filippelli I'm good. Thanks.
jim_halpert Look at that.
dwight_schrute I'm Jim Halpert.
jim_halpert Spot on.
dwight_schrute Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh.
