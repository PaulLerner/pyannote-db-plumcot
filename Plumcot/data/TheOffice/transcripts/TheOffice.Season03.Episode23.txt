michael_scott David!
david_wallace Oh, Michael?
michael_scott Are we all set?
david_wallace Isn't our interview tomorrow?
michael_scott Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
david_wallace You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
michael_scott Thought I'd catch a show.
david_wallace In the middle of a work day?
michael_scott Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
david_wallace Okay.
michael_scott Um, how many people are you interviewing?
david_wallace We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
michael_scott Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
david_wallace I don't think so.
michael_scott Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
david_wallace I believe we put you in charge.
michael_scott Ah, great. No further questions.
david_wallace Okay, Michael.
michael_scott Okay.
david_wallace I'm really looking forward to our interview.
michael_scott And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
michael_scott I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
kevin_malone Hey.
jim_halpert Hey, Kev.
kevin_malone What's different about you? You look worse.
jim_halpert Thank you.
meredith_palmer You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
jim_halpert Ohhh...
meredith_palmer Turn around.
jim_halpert No.
meredith_palmer Yes.
jim_halpert No way.
meredith_palmer Do it!
andy_bernard Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
jim_halpert Andy...
andy_bernard What is it, Big Haircut?
jim_halpert Nothing.
andy_bernard Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.
jim_halpert Yup.
andy_bernard What?
jim_halpert Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
pam_beesly Hey. I think it looks great.
jim_halpert Thanks, Pam.
pam_beesly After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so thank you.
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute You wanted to see me?
michael_scott Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
dwight_schrute But that's my name. Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. Thank you.
michael_scott Okay. Uh...
dwight_schrute Thank you, Michael.
michael_scott Uh, okay.
dwight_schrute Thank you so much.
michael_scott Stop crying.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
michael_scott Ohhhhh...
pam_beesly Hey.
karen_filippelli Hey.
pam_beesly Um, about the beach...
karen_filippelli It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
pam_beesly Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
karen_filippelli Oh. Okay.
karen_filippelli Pam is... kind of a bitch.
karen_filippelli Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
jim_halpert Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
jim_halpert So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
michael_scott Why so you can do it?
karen_filippelli
jim_halpert Whoops.
michael_scott No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
jim_halpert Hmmm.
karen_filippelli Heh.
michael_scott Moon each other.
jim_halpert Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
michael_scott All right.
jim_halpert All right.
michael_scott Your loss.
karen_filippelli Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
michael_scott Cruise control.
karen_filippelli Oh.
kevin_malone So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
jim_halpert Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
kevin_malone Pam is taller.
jim_halpert You sure?
kevin_malone Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
jim_halpert Wow.
kevin_malone I think Karen has a prettier face.
jim_halpert Uh, hmm. Uh, hmm. What else?
kevin_malone Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
jim_halpert Hm. Really tough call.
kevin_malone Yeah.
jim_halpert You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
kevin_malone Will do.
jim_halpert All right.
oscar_martinez Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship.
pam_beesly Wow, very funny.
stanley_hudson I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
kelly_kapoor Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
pam_beesly
meredith_palmer You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
creed_bratton I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
creed_bratton www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
ryan_howard Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
michael_scott There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
kevin_malone Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
michael_scott No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
oscar_martinez Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
michael_scott No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
oscar_martinez Michael...
kevin_malone What?
angela_martin Why?
oscar_martinez I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
michael_scott Yes, I...
angela_martin Wha? Who gave you that advice?
kevin_malone Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
michael_scott I have to buy another place.
angela_martin But you said you were in debt.
oscar_martinez You're not sure that you have the job.
michael_scott I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.
dwight_schrute How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
angela_martin No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
dwight_schrute No, no, not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job.
angela_martin Not now. Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
dwight_schrute Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
jim_halpert Oh hey, Dwight.
dwight_schrute I am gonna be your new boss. It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.
jim_halpert Does my room have cable?
dwight_schrute No. And the sheets are made of fire.
jim_halpert Can I change rooms?
dwight_schrute Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
jim_halpert Can I have a late checkout?
dwight_schrute I'll have to talk to the manager.
jim_halpert You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
dwight_schrute I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!
jim_halpert Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
dwight_schrute Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
jim_halpert Go.
dwight_schrute Eighty thousand dollars a year.
dwight_schrute Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
andy_bernard I will see you at the inter-view.
dwight_schrute Yes you will.
michael_scott Who is D. Abramson?
pam_beesly He's from that company in Pitts...
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Why... are you here?
jan_levinson Uh, how are you?
michael_scott I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
jan_levinson I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
michael_scott Why privately?
jan_levinson I just, I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
michael_scott Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
jan_levinson Okay.
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
pam_beesly What do you want me to do?
michael_scott Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
pam_beesly What about Meredith?
michael_scott No. She's an alternate.
michael_scott So, how you been?
jan_levinson Been good.
michael_scott Good.
jan_levinson Good.
michael_scott Yeah.
jan_levinson Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
michael_scott Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
pam_beesly So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
karen_filippelli 'Cause of Jan again?
karen_filippelli Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
pam_beesly Uh, sure.
karen_filippelli Thanks.
pam_beesly I really hope you get the job.
karen_filippelli Thanks.
jan_levinson After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
michael_scott Hmm.
jan_levinson To kinda clear my mind.
michael_scott Sound good. Sounds fun.
jan_levinson It was. Yeah, it was good. I think I'll just get right to the point, you know? Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
michael_scott Hmm..
jan_levinson I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
michael_scott Would you excuse me for a second?
jan_levinson Ohh...
michael_scott Defcon twenty. She wants to get back together.
phyllis_vance What are you gonna do?
michael_scott I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
karen_filippelli Do you want to get back together with her?
michael_scott No, no. What do I do?
pam_beesly Just don't get back together with her.
michael_scott What if she makes me?
angela_martin How can she make you get back together with her?
michael_scott She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
pam_beesly This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
michael_scott I wasn't.
pam_beesly You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
michael_scott You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
pam_beesly Right.
michael_scott Wow.
karen_filippelli Do it.
michael_scott I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
michael_scott Okay. Jan, we need to talk.
michael_scott Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
pam_beesly Oh my God. Huge!
jim_halpert Yeah, bigger actually.
pam_beesly That's crazy!
jim_halpert Mm-hm.
pam_beesly Wow!
karen_filippelli Oh my God. Can you believe that?
jim_halpert Unbelievable.
karen_filippelli Wow!
jim_halpert She could put the cup right there.
karen_filippelli I know!
pam_beesly No, it's fine. I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that one time.
meredith_palmer I would never do that. Waste of money. In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
kevin_malone I love fake boobs. Often times, you find them on strippers.
creed_bratton I find it offensive. Au natural, baby. That's how I like 'em. Swing low, sweet chariots.
jan_levinson So... there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
michael_scott Yeah.
jan_levinson I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
michael_scott First got priorities.
jan_levinson And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
michael_scott Let's get back together.
michael_scott No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent.
dwight_schrute Okay, everyone, listen up! Time to begin the interview process! Andrew Bernard.
andy_bernard Saving the best for first!
karen_filippelli All right, you guys. See you later, wish us luck!
dwight_schrute No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael.
oscar_martinez Good luck, you guys!
dwight_schrute What did I say!?
pam_beesly Good luck.
jim_halpert Thanks.
pam_beesly I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. That's Popeye.
dwight_schrute I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?
andy_bernard White, because it contains all other colors.
dwight_schrute Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?
andy_bernard You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
dwight_schrute What is the capital of Maine?
andy_bernard The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
dwight_schrute Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
andy_bernard Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
dwight_schrute You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
andy_bernard I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
andy_bernard I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
dwight_schrute Time! No, you failed.
andy_bernard Damn it!
dwight_schrute This interview is over. I'll let you know.
karen_filippelli Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
jim_halpert Totally, no problem. What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
karen_filippelli Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
jim_halpert Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too? What did she accomplish?
karen_filippelli No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
jim_halpert Oh...
karen_filippelli 'Cause I'm going to get the job.
michael_scott Remarkable.
jan_levinson Thanks.
michael_scott Wait, wait. Check one more time.
jan_levinson Oh, okay.
michael_scott Very good
jan_levinson Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
michael_scott Yes, indeed.
jan_levinson Good luck with your interview. Bye.
michael_scott So, I guess we're getting back together.
pam_beesly What happened?
michael_scott Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
michael_scott Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life. She treated me poorly. We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman. Love is a mystery.
karen_filippelli So we have all night. Where do you want to go first?
jim_halpert Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
karen_filippelli How often do you come here?
jim_halpert Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
karen_filippelli I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
michael_scott Hey, everybody. The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado, I would like to start saying my goodbyes Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
dwight_schrute Who's ready to work?
jim_halpert Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
karen_filippelli That wasn't him.
karen_filippelli So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
jim_halpert Oh do you mean when I get the job?
karen_filippelli Well, if you get the job then I'd move here with you. Would you move with me? I'm not stupid. I was at the beach. We won't have a future in Scranton. There's one too many people there.
jim_halpert You mean Kevin?
karen_filippelli Exactly. But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
jim_halpert Yeah, I do. C'mon.
michael_scott How are you guys doing? Need anything?
karen_filippelli Uh, no, we're good. Thanks.
michael_scott I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
jim_halpert Who's that?
michael_scott That is Beardy.
jim_halpert Beardy?
michael_scott Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert I'm gonna introduce myself.
michael_scott No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so...
michael_scott I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing. Jim and Karen are here, which is cute. They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered. Except daddy... is the best actor around. Daddy is Meryl Streep.
dwight_schrute Michael is gone.
andy_bernard Hail to the chief!
dwight_schrute My first order of business make Andrew Bernard my number two.
andy_bernard My first order of business accept.
dwight_schrute As if you had a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime.
andy_bernard Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad.
michael_scott Hey! Hunter! Wha's up my brutha? This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
hunter Uh, administrative assistant.
michael_scott Jan in yet?
hunter I think she's comin' in... later.
michael_scott Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
hunter Sure.
michael_scott Just say, "I want to squeeze them." It's code. She'll know what it means.
hunter Okay.
michael_scott Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her, "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
dwight_schrute You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
pam_beesly Thank you.
dwight_schrute I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
pam_beesly Really?
dwight_schrute Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
pam_beesly You will be your own assistant.
dwight_schrute Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
pam_beesly Okay. So... you would be the Regional Manager, and the Assistant Regional Manager. Andy is your number two. I would be the Secret Assistant Regional Manager.
dwight_schrute Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute Do you accept?
pam_beesly Absolutely, I do.
pam_beesly I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, "Absolutely, I do."
michael_scott Hello, hello!
david_wallace Michael, good to see you!
michael_scott Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
david_wallace Oh, great. I've been meaning to thank you by the way. You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget? That is nice work. So, let me ask you a question right off the bat. What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
michael_scott Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
david_wallace Okay. And your strengths?
michael_scott Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
david_wallace Oh. Yes. Very good.
michael_scott Thank you.
david_wallace Very good.
phyllis_vance Dwight is our new boss.
oscar_martinez Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
pam_beesly Then who do you think will get the job?
kevin_malone Karen. She looks corporate. Those little pants suits.
phyllis_vance I think it's gonna be Michael.
oscar_martinez Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
phyllis_vance No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
oscar_martinez Mm. Yeah.
dwight_schrute Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
pam_beesly What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
dwight_schrute Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent.
oscar_martinez So ten thousand of your dollars is worth one real dollar?
dwight_schrute Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!
stanley_hudson Amen.
dwight_schrute Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
kevin_malone Do we have to?
dwight_schrute Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me." Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!
pam_beesly I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned. And I wish Jim were here.
david_wallace What do you think we could be doing better?
michael_scott I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper." I don't know, something like that.
david_wallace Okay!
michael_scott Okay.
david_wallace Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
michael_scott Thank you.
david_wallace It is always a treat when our paths cross.
michael_scott It is always a treat when our paths cross. So, oh! Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together. So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.
david_wallace You're back together.
michael_scott Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
david_wallace Okay, uh. Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
michael_scott I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
david_wallace No, we're letting Jan go.
dwight_schrute Listen up. Let's start... from the ground up. Where does paper come from?
kevin_malone Trees.
dwight_schrute Trees! And where do trees grow?
kevin_malone Forest.
dwight_schrute Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
stanley_hudson Liquid.
dwight_schrute Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.
stanley_hudson I don't want it.
dwight_schrute Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
stanley_hudson Make it 100.
dwight_schrute We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
stanley_hudson No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
dwight_schrute What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
stanley_hudson The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
dwight_schrute Okay---
andy_bernard That's it!
dwight_schrute What---
andy_bernard Class is canceled, everybody out!
dwight_schrute No wait, what are you doing?!
andy_bernard I'm punishing them.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled.
all@
pam_beesly HEY! COME ON! Let's listen to Dwight's presentation!
oscar_martinez What--- What are you winking for?
dwight_schrute Zip your lid!
karen_filippelli So, that's... my basic 5 year plan. And after that, who knows?
david_wallace Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
karen_filippelli Yeah?
david_wallace ...what do you think about Michael Scott?
karen_filippelli He's a very nice man. And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
david_wallace This is off the record.
karen_filippelli He would be disaster.
jan_levinson Hey you!
michael_scott Hey.
jan_levinson How was your interview?
michael_scott Pretty good.
jan_levinson Yeah?
michael_scott Could have gone better I guess.
jan_levinson Oh. I'll put in a good word for you.
michael_scott Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
jan_levinson What?
michael_scott Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun.
jan_levinson What's... what's the matter? What... what happened in there?
michael_scott I can't tell you.
jan_levinson Tell me what?
jan_levinson You son of a bitch!
david_wallace Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
jan_levinson You're firing me? Where the hell do you get off?
david_wallace Frankly, it's overdue. Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
jan_levinson Erratic?
david_wallace Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work! You smoke constantly in your office. You spend most of the day online shopping. You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days. Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale. You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
jan_levinson Is it because of these?
michael_scott Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
jan_levinson No, I wanna know. I wanna know! Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
david_wallace It's not.
jan_levinson No?
david_wallace It's not.
jan_levinson 'Cause he likes them. Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
david_wallace The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company. You are clearly unstable.
michael_scott Hey! You're unstable!
jan_levinson Yeah!
michael_scott No--- We're all unstable.
jan_levinson Okay, you know what? I'm just not leaving. I'm not leaving. Not leaving.
michael_scott David, I did not tell her.
andy_bernard It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
dwight_schrute It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black.
andy_bernard This is gonna look so awesome!
dwight_schrute It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
andy_bernard Totally!
jan_levinson Bye Hunter.
hunter Bye.
jan_levinson Good luck with your band.
hunter Oh, thank---
jan_levinson Don't let them change you, okay? So long, .
michael_scott So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.
david_wallace Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
michael_scott Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
david_wallace No, we're not giving you the job.
michael_scott You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?
david_wallace I do.
michael_scott Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.
david_wallace Yes.
michael_scott Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two. Either one of them... excellent candidates.
karen_filippelli Wow. That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
jim_halpert Yeah. Kinda feel bad for her though.
karen_filippelli Don't! She's nuts!
jim_halpert Oh, man. You know what? This might take a while. You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
karen_filippelli Okay, good! Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch. And, I was gonna meet them, so...
jim_halpert Okay.
karen_filippelli Just call me when you're done.
jim_halpert Sure.
karen_filippelli Good luck, Halpert.
jim_halpert Thank you.
headquarter_receptionist Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace. Sure.
jan_levinson Oh, God! I mean, I just don't understand! It's just so rude, you know? I mean, the absolute nerve of that guy!
michael_scott I know. I know, I'm sorry about that. That was terrible.
jan_levinson Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know? It's fine, actually, I do. I really think it's great that it happened. Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so...
michael_scott Well, it's... No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
jan_levinson Oh, I know, I know. It's just... I'm sorry. It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery. Ohhh! They make my moods totally unpredictable! Wow! What am I gonna do?
michael_scott I don't know. Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale. Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
jan_levinson Live together. Actually, wait a minute! This could be great! This could be perfect! You know, my full-time job could be our relationship. I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5 15. It could work. This could work, really!
michael_scott I'll be baaaaack! And I am baaaack!
pam_beesly How'd it go?
michael_scott No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon.
michael_scott Everybody, may I have your attention please? It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job. I know, I know, I know. "Michael, what are you thinking? You were a shoe in." Well, got down there. I nailed the interview. And the strangest thing happened. Why is my office black?
dwight_schrute To intimidate my subordinates.
michael_scott That's stupid.
dwight_schrute It was Andy's idea.
michael_scott You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack. Ryan, coffee.
ryan_howard I don't do that stuff anymore.
michael_scott No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.
michael_scott So I'm back. And I am never, ever going to leave. I am going nowhere. This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
pam_beesly Did... Karen get the job?
michael_scott Back to work. Still waitin' on that coffee.
dwight_schrute Pam, hello.
pam_beesly Dwight, hello.
dwight_schrute I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity.
pam_beesly No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic. And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today. Jim and I... are just... too similar. Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man. A man version. But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
david_wallace I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
jim_halpert I should leave.
david_wallace Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy.
jim_halpert Thanks.
david_wallace Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
jim_halpert I'm sorry, wait, so is the question "How'd I get to be so awesome?" Because, I don't have an answer for you.
david_wallace Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
jim_halpert Yes, absolutely.
david_wallace And that, uh, questionnaire. Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
jim_halpert Oh, no, absolutely.
david_wallace ...that's a HR formality. We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like. Kendall. Ugh. So, first up...
jim_halpert There you go.
david_wallace How do you think you function here in New York?
jim_halpert What's that? Oh, uh, great. You know? I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a energy... New York has, uh... Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight. So that's a... bonus.
david_wallace You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. What have you liked most about that place?
jim_halpert The friendships.
david_wallace Okay. Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul. So... long haul. Where do you see yourself in ten years?
jim_halpert How are your feet?
pam_beesly Medium rare. Thanks.
jim_halpert The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
pam_beesly I know.
jim_halpert And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
pam_beesly Well, I wish you would.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
pam_beesly I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job. I mean, why wouldn't he? He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK. We're friends. And I'm sure we'll stay friends. We just, we never got the timing right. You know? I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and... But you know what? It's OK. I'm totally fine. Everything is gonna be totally---
jim_halpert Pam. Sorry. Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
pam_beesly Yes.
jim_halpert All right. Then... it's a date.
pam_beesly I'm sorry, what was the question?
david_wallace So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty. But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job. Great! I'm so glad. We're all very excited you're going to be joining us. It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
ryan_howard I'm excited too. Okay. Bye.
kelly_kapoor Who was that?
ryan_howard Nobody. You and I are done.
kelly_kapoor What?!
