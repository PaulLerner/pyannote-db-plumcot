michael_scott Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
dwight_schrute They are either going to say yes... or no.
michael_scott Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
dwight_schrute Think it through.
michael_scott Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
jim_halpert Can we not?
michael_scott No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
jim_halpert Still want that.
michael_scott Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
creed_bratton Ryan!
dwight_schrute Fumble! Yaaah!
michael_scott Hey, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
michael_scott You all right Ryan?
dwight_schrute Ryan.
ryan_howard Yeah.
michael_scott Pam!
dwight_schrute Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
jim_halpert Cugino's pizza.
dwight_schrute Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question Do their pizzas play DVDs?
jim_halpert Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
jim_halpert What did I do to deserve this?
pam_beesly Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
jim_halpert No.
pam_beesly Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
phyllis_vance Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
pam_beesly Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
phyllis_vance Oh.
jim_halpert Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
pam_beesly Ok, cool.
pam_beesly I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
michael_scott That's what she said!
dwight_schrute Ha! I don't get it.
michael_scott Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
dwight_schrute Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
michael_scott Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
michael_scott Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
dwight_schrute What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..."
michael_scott That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
dwight_schrute When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
dwight_schrute I can't do this.
michael_scott That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
dwight_schrute Oh, okay.
michael_scott But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
dwight_schrute Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
michael_scott Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
dwight_schrute I'll try and think of one. When...
michael_scott Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
dwight_schrute Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
michael_scott Insult.
pam_beesly Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
jim_halpert Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
jim_halpert I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
jim_halpert Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
oscar_martinez I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
michael_scott But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
dwight_schrute Saleswoman has a v*g1n*.
michael_scott It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class.
dwight_schrute But I'm right?
michael_scott Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
dwight_schrute Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
michael_scott I do. Both of them.
dwight_schrute Could I have a copy of one of them?
michael_scott No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
michael_scott Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott Congratulations.
phyllis_vance Unbelievable.
michael_scott You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
dwight_schrute That is so great about the bonus!
michael_scott No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
stanley_hudson Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
phyllis_vance It's unbelievable!
dwight_schrute Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
pam_beesly Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
dwight_schrute Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
stanley_hudson Why would this affect our bonuses?
dwight_schrute They are unrelated.
kelly_kapoor Is Brad okay?
dwight_schrute He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
oscar_martinez What the hell is going on here?
angela_martin Are we out of jobs?
dwight_schrute Yes.
kelly_kapoor This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
michael_scott He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
stanley_hudson Michael?
michael_scott Yeah.
stanley_hudson You said we were getting bonuses.
michael_scott All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
stanley_hudson Cancel wallpaper.
michael_scott As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. You saw the plaque, right? All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
pam_beesly You mean Toastmasters?
michael_scott Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
pam_beesly Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
jim_halpert Can I go?
michael_scott Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
jim_halpert So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
kevin_malone You should go to Hedonism.
jim_halpert What is that?
kevin_malone It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
jim_halpert I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
toby_flenderson Been to Amsterdam.
michael_scott Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
toby_flenderson To Amsterdam.
jim_halpert When did you go there?
toby_flenderson Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.
jim_halpert Really for like how long?
toby_flenderson Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
creed_bratton Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
jim_halpert Where do I want to go?
creed_bratton I'd send you to Hong Kong.
creed_bratton Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China.
michael_scott Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
dwight_schrute Good morning, Vietnam! Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
jim_halpert No. We're not.
dwight_schrute Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
jim_halpert Which means absolutely nothing.
dwight_schrute Michael, can you explain?
michael_scott Well, it's mostly made up. So...
michael_scott Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
michael_scott Confidence, Dwight.
jim_halpert Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
dwight_schrute I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
jim_halpert Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
dwight_schrute Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
jim_halpert You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
dwight_schrute You did?
jim_halpert Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
dwight_schrute Yes. I am.
jim_halpert The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
dwight_schrute Which is?
jim_halpert You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
jim_halpert Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
jim_halpert Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind.
dwight_schrute I'll glance at it.
michael_scott It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
angela_martin The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Thank you, Angela.
kelly_kapoor Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
pam_beesly Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
ryan_howard You're inviting Jim?
pam_beesly Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
michael_scott All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
Overhead#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode17 You all ready for this?
angela_martin I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
kevin_malone I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
angela_martin Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
master_of_ceremonies Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year, Dwight Schrute!
all@
michael_scott Dwight, they called your name.
master_of_ceremonies Dwight, how we doing?
dwight_schrute No, I can't... I ca...
michael_scott All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. All right!
all@
michael_scott Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
kevin_malone I always set it at 69.
pam_beesly Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
kelly_kapoor But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
ryan_howard Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
kelly_kapoor Oh.
pam_beesly Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
ryan_howard I know what I said.
michael_scott I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. Michael Winslow, anyone?
michael_scott Car starting. All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
all@
michael_scott Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
dwight_schrute Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight. I say to you and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
all@
dwight_schrute WE ARE WARRIORS!
all@
dwight_schrute Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
all@
dwight_schrute Yeah. Yes!
oscar_martinez I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
jim_halpert Maybe. Thanks.
ryan_howard You really think you're going to go?
jim_halpert Yeah. I'm definitely going.
ryan_howard Nice. Send me a postcard.
ryan_howard Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
dwight_schrute No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.
all@
dwight_schrute Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
all@ Together that we prevail!
pam_beesly Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
jim_halpert I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
pam_beesly That's awesome. Where are you staying?
jim_halpert I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
pam_beesly When are you leaving?
jim_halpert I'm... leaving on June 8th.
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
pam_beesly Oh yeah. That's too bad.
jim_halpert Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
pam_beesly It's ok. I got it.
jim_halpert Alright.
dwight_schrute Ok, thanks. There you are. What happened?
michael_scott I got thirsty. How'd it go?
dwight_schrute It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
michael_scott You would not believe what happened here.
dwight_schrute What? Something happened?
michael_scott Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
dwight_schrute Weird.
michael_scott Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
dwight_schrute Con artist.
michael_scott She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
michael_scott Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
