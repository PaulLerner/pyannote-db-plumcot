andy_bernard Good morning, Pam.
pam_beesly Oh, welcome back, Andy.
andy_bernard Drew. I'm Drew now.
pam_beesly Oh. Drew. Sorry.
andy_bernard Apology not... accepted. Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place.
andy_bernard Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
andy_bernard Mornin' Jim.
jim_halpert Hey, Andy. How are you, man?
andy_bernard Good. Drew.
jim_halpert What's that?
andy_bernard Dr--- You can call me Drew.
jim_halpert No, I'm not gonna call you that.
andy_bernard Cool. I can't control what you do. I can only control what I do.
jim_halpert Andy.
andy_bernard Drew. Dwight. How's it goin' man?
dwight_schrute Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
dwight_schrute Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
jim_halpert Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
dwight_schrute Ok, tell him that's not true.
jim_halpert Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
andy_bernard You guys...
dwight_schrute Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!
jim_halpert Andy! Nah, that's too far.
dwight_schrute Damn you.
michael_scott Today is Safety Training Day. Toby is leading ours upstairs. Yeauck. But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat. We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse. And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
darryl_philbin Now, this is the forklift. You need--- You need a license to operate this machine. That means the upstairs office workers can't drive it. ... Quiz! Mike.
michael_scott Hmm.
darryl_philbin Should you drive the forklift?
michael_scott I can, and I have.
darryl_philbin No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand?
lonny You're not allowed to drive the forklift.
darryl_philbin It's not safe, you don't have a license.
michael_scott Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift. Pudge has driven the forklift.
madge Madge.
michael_scott I thought your name was Pudge?
madge No, it's always been Madge.
michael_scott Okay. Um, her.
darryl_philbin Her. Yes, "her" is qualified to work a dangerous machine. You are not. Okay?
michael_scott Ah, fine.
darryl_philbin Do you understand that?
michael_scott Yeeesh.
darryl_philbin We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year. This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
michael_scott "Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!"
darryl_philbin And I fell and busted my ankle. I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
darryl_philbin The baler can flatten a car engine. It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
andy_bernard It's on!
darryl_philbin How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
michael_scott Bail'er? I hardly know her.
lonny Dammit, Michael. Pay attention, man.
darryl_philbin Anybody wanna take a guess? Anybody?
kevin_malone Five bucks says it's over 50.
jim_halpert You really wanna bet?
darryl_philbin Anybody?
kevin_malone Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode19 How many?
jim_halpert Ok, you're on.
darryl_philbin Ten people, Michael. Ten people. Would you like to be one of them?
kevin_malone Damn...
darryl_philbin You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
jim_halpert No, don't worry about it. We'll just got double or nothin'.
kevin_malone On what?
jim_halpert I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
kevin_malone Nice.
oscar_martinez What are you guys talkin' about?
darryl_philbin These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers, Michael, should not go anywhere near them.
michael_scott Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
darryl_philbin It would be the worst thing in the world! It would! Very much so.
lonny What the hell is wrong with this man?
michael_scott It's a big red trash compactor!
lonny What are you---
darryl_philbin It's not a trash compactor! It's a baler!
lonny Don't disrespect the baler!
michael_scott Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions...
darryl_philbin No do not touch it!
michael_scott ...would I go near---
darryl_philbin There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
michael_scott Toby now has the floor... and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life. Let me rephrase that. I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl. Here we go!
toby_flenderson Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome. It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour. For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
michael_scott Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and...
toby_flenderson Um, yeah. You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
michael_scott Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
darryl_philbin Take them at the same time.
michael_scott Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
toby_flenderson No, no. Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
ryan_howard What about a long sleeve T?
toby_flenderson Well, that'll work.
kevin_malone Long johns? A shaw?
toby_flenderson You know, anything that warms you.
michael_scott Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom. Sorry, he is very lame. Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."
darryl_philbin Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
lonny Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?
michael_scott Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
darryl_philbin Actually, you did.
michael_scott Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
toby_flenderson Sedentary.
michael_scott Yes. "Which can contribute to heart disease." Heart disease kills more people that balers.
lonny That's called having a fat butt, Michael.
michael_scott Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
lonny Yeah, yeah. That's, that's fat butt disease. That's what you suffer from?
michael_scott No.
lonny Fat butt disease, Michael?
kelly_kapoor Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
lonny Yeah? I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you?
kelly_kapoor Ryan?
lonny Dude, tell your girl to shut up.
kelly_kapoor What?!
ryan_howard Kelly, you insulted the gentleman. Please apologize.
kelly_kapoor Are you kidding me?
darryl_philbin Alright, we outta here.
michael_scott Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---
lonny Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.
darryl_philbin That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike. It's serious down there. We do dangerous stuff, man. This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball. You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life. Sittin' on your biscuit. Never havin' to risk it.
michael_scott Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
michael_scott Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse. I worked in a warehouse. Men's Warehouse. I was a greeter. I'd like to see Darryl greet people. Probably make 'em feel like wimps. Not me, I... "Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Men's Warehouse. We have a special on khaki pants today." ... This is one example.
kevin_malone Ten.
oscar_martinez Really, ten? That's your guess? You're a professional accountant.
jim_halpert There's like ten green ones.
oscar_martinez Forty-two.
jim_halpert I'm gonna say fifty.
karen_filippelli Fifty-one.
jim_halpert Oh, don't be that person.
kevin_malone That is lame.
karen_filippelli It's a strategy!
pam_beesly It's called being smart.
karen_filippelli Thank you.
kevin_malone Oh, geeze.
pam_beesly I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
pam_beesly Ten...
jim_halpert Kev's out.
kevin_malone Damn it.
pam_beesly 47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
all@ Oooh!
kevin_malone That is not fair. He has spent hours up here at reception with you. Hours and hours.
jim_halpert Okay, okay.
kevin_malone No, constantly. Like, for years.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
pam_beesly I don't understand the question.
michael_scott Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.
pam_beesly Yeah...
michael_scott I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
pam_beesly It's really hard to demonstrate depression. Their safety training had visuals.
michael_scott Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
pam_beesly So, you're okay?
michael_scott Indubitably.
michael_scott They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
dwight_schrute Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?
michael_scott I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---
dwight_schrute Wolves.
michael_scott Nn--- Depression.
dwight_schrute Visual aids.
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute A quilt. Depression quilt?
michael_scott No time to sew a quilt. ... I got it. Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.
michael_scott You may be asking yourself, "What am I doing on a trampoline?" Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day. Not! Here's the plan. Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar. Only this time, where's Michael? Oh my God! He is on the roof! Now I have got their attention. I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression. And then I say, "Hey! You ever seen a suicide?" And I jump. And they freak out. And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes. Nice side note They might think "Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael." But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun. I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!
kelly_kapoor So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue. So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, number three becomes number two, etc, etc. And let's just say that I just sent back Love Actually, which was awesome. And they sent me Uptown Girls, which is also awesome. But guess what, now I want to see love actually again, but it's at the bottom of the que! Oh no, what do I do!? What I do, is this. I go online, I go click, click, click. And I change the order of the que, so that I can see Love Actually as soon as I want to. It's so easy, Ryan. Do you really not know how Netflix works?
ryan_howard I guess I forgot.
kelly_kapoor You're such a ditz.
kevin_malone Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
dwight_schrute Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!
michael_scott Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or...
dwight_schrute We measured it once...
michael_scott Go buy some watermelons.
dwight_schrute Seedless?
michael_scott Just...
toby_flenderson Creed is eating an apple. I found a potato.
pam_beesly Hey Creed.
creed_bratton Hey!
pam_beesly Hey.
creed_bratton Hello.
pam_beesly Yes!
kevin_malone Here you go.
toby_flenderson Nice.
karen_filippelli I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out.
dwight_schrute Ready?
michael_scott Let's do it! Drop that sucker.
dwight_schrute
michael_scott BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.
dwight_schrute Okay.
michael_scott Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
dwight_schrute Got it.
michael_scott Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
dwight_schrute We're not allowed to use the baler.
michael_scott Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
dwight_schrute I'm on it!
dwight_schrute I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
andy_bernard Thank you.
dwight_schrute It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.
andy_bernard Anything.
dwight_schrute Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
andy_bernard You mean a moon bounce.
dwight_schrute What do you think? You've got an hour.
andy_bernard I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
dwight_schrute Shunning resumed.
andy_bernard Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
dwight_schrute Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.
dwight_schrute Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision.
michael_scott Yes, thank you for seeing that.
dwight_schrute When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
michael_scott I don't know if I wanna do this.
dwight_schrute Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
michael_scott No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.
dwight_schrute That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll!
michael_scott Rock n' roll!
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott That's right! I am not thinking.
dwight_schrute Near near near near near!
michael_scott Yes! Yeah!
dwight_schrute Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof!
michael_scott Woo!
dwight_schrute Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!
michael_scott Woo!
dwight_schrute Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
michael_scott I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!
dwight_schrute Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
andy_bernard Whoa! What's the situation?
dwight_schrute Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
andy_bernard Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?
dwight_schrute Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
stanley_hudson Is it nice outside?
dwight_schrute It's gorgeous. Let's go!
stanley_hudson Do I need my jacket?
dwight_schrute No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!
ryan_howard Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
dwight_schrute Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!
dwight_schrute Come on, hurry up you guys!
michael_scott My life! Oh, my life...
dwight_schrute Michael, what's wrong?!
michael_scott Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
dwight_schrute Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
michael_scott Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!
dwight_schrute Is that the last year the data was available?
michael_scott Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
dwight_schrute Don't do anything rash!
michael_scott Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
dwight_schrute I didn't... I didn't think you needed them for this part.
michael_scott Okay... that's...
dwight_schrute you said to just...
michael_scott That's the whole point, dummy.
dwight_schrute Okay, I'm on it!
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute Attention blue collar workers!
pam_beesly What are the odds that this is in any way real?
jim_halpert I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
kevin_malone Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
kevin_malone If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it. If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a very rich dude.
dwight_schrute Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
michael_scott Oooooh, my life!
dwight_schrute Michael! What's wrong?
michael_scott Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
dwight_schrute Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
michael_scott Dwight, you ignorant slut.
jim_halpert Well, you know, the first performance was a little off. But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show. Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
michael_scott And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
jim_halpert Oh, excuse me. It's my... favorite part.
angela_martin This is just offensive.
ryan_howard At least we're outside.
creed_bratton Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
jim_halpert Oh my God, there is a castle.
dwight_schrute No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael.
michael_scott Damn it.
pam_beesly Oh... God. Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
jim_halpert Oh. He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
pam_beesly Yeah...
jim_halpert Hey uh, Michael. Don't jump on the bouncy castle. You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
pam_beesly Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
michael_scott What is it?
pam_beesly Come down and... open it and you'll see.
michael_scott Dwight, find out what the present is.
dwight_schrute Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing.
jim_halpert Dwight...
pam_beesly Dwight, what are you---
dwight_schrute Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
michael_scott Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?
darryl_philbin Mike, this is the opposite of safety. You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
michael_scott You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
darryl_philbin Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
michael_scott What do I have to live for?
darryl_philbin A lot... of things. Uh, you, uh... What about Jan? Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man. It's goin' good, right?
michael_scott It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The s*x isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
darryl_philbin Mike, you're a very brave man. I mean, it takes courage just to be you. To get out of bed every single day, knowing full well, you gotta be you.
michael_scott Do you really mean that?
darryl_philbin I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong. And I ain't that brave.
michael_scott I'm braver than you?
darryl_philbin Way braver! You Braveheart, man.
michael_scott I Braveheart. I am.
darryl_philbin Come down, okay?
michael_scott Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
michael_scott An office... is as safe as the people in it. And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office. That's the danger I found myself in today. I saved a life. My own. Am I a hero? I really can't say. But, yes.
