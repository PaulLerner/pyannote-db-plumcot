oscar_martinez Here are our final actual costs for this year.
michael_scott Mmm... okay.
oscar_martinez As you can see, we did pretty well, so...
michael_scott Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
oscar_martinez Alright, well this is the overall budget for this fiscal year along the x-axis...
michael_scott Yes.
oscar_martinez Right there.
michael_scott There's the x-ax...icks.
oscar_martinez You can see clearly on this page that we have a surplus of $4300.
michael_scott Mmhmm, okay.
oscar_martinez But we have to spend that by the end of the day or it will be deducted from next year's budget.
michael_scott Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
oscar_martinez Your mommy and daddy give you ten dollars to open up a lemonade stand. So you go out and you buy cups and you buy lemons and you buy sugar. And now you find out that it only costs you nine dollars.
michael_scott Ho-oh!
oscar_martinez So you have an extra dollar.
michael_scott Yeah.
oscar_martinez So you can give that dollar back to mommy and daddy, but guess what? Next summer...
michael_scott I'll be six.
oscar_martinez And you ask them for money, they're gonna give you nine dollars. 'Cause that's what they think it costs to run the stand. So what you want to do is spend that dollar on something now, so that your parents think it costs ten dollars to run the lemonade stand.
michael_scott So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
oscar_martinez We have to spend that $4300 by the end of the day or it'll be deducted from next year's budget.
michael_scott Whoo.
oscar_martinez We should spend this money on a new copier, which we desperately need.
michael_scott Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...
michael_scott Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... Can anybody guess?
pam_beesly New chairs?
michael_scott No, a new copier! Unless everybody can agree on something better?
oscar_martinez No, no, please. Please do not do this.
pam_beesly Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.
michael_scott So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
pam_beesly Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...
oscar_martinez Now listen, we are a paper company. How can we take pride in our jobs if we have to put our fine paper in this wretched machine?
pam_beesly Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.
oscar_martinez Pam, you make more copies than anyone.
pam_beesly Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.
michael_scott Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
stanley_hudson I'm with Pam. Chairs.
michael_scott Alright, so, teams forming.
toby_flenderson We should really have the office's air quality tested. We have radon coming from below, we have asbestos in the ceilings. These are silent killers.
michael_scott You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
toby_flenderson You'll see.
pam_beesly Michael?
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.
jim_halpert Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
pam_beesly What? Jim.
jim_halpert Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.
meredith_palmer Jim, good for you, standing up to Pam like that.
creed_bratton The balls on you, man.
oscar_martinez So Michael, what do you think?
michael_scott Why me?
jim_halpert You have to make the decision.
michael_scott Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
andy_bernard Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...
dwight_schrute Yeah, do tell.
andy_bernard I mean, like, "156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left."
dwight_schrute Mmhmm.
andy_bernard "Walk until you hear the beehive."
dwight_schrute How could it be more clear?
angela_martin I think Andy makes an excellent point.
dwight_schrute Okay.
angela_martin But my biggest concern is that there's only one bathroom.
dwight_schrute We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
angela_martin Nana Mimi cannot squat over some trench.
dwight_schrute Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
andy_bernard Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?
andy_bernard We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...
jim_halpert Mmhmm.
pam_beesly I really think you should reconsider.
jim_halpert Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
pam_beesly Yeah, I know.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly But I really think you should reconsider.
jim_halpert Beesly, are you threatening me?
pam_beesly Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground . All right.
jim_halpert Okay.
jim_halpert Whew.
dwight_schrute This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
andy_bernard Hmm... mm, what's that smell?
dwight_schrute You're gonna need to be more specific.
angela_martin Manure. Get rid of it.
dwight_schrute Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
angela_martin Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
dwight_schrute You wanna eat, don't you?
angela_martin Honey, say something!
andy_bernard Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
dwight_schrute ...I'll consider it.
andy_bernard See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. ...Darn! Heh.
dwight_schrute There's a hose out back.
andy_bernard Okay.
pam_beesly Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly Well that never happened.
oscar_martinez Michael?
michael_scott I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
oscar_martinez I'm just gonna grab some lunch. You wanna come with?
michael_scott Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
jim_halpert Woah, you guys going to lunch?
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert Mind if I join?
michael_scott Ohh, God!
jim_halpert All right.
michael_scott Yeah!
jim_halpert Let's go.
michael_scott Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
jim_halpert Let's do it.
michael_scott All right! Cool!
jim_halpert Where we going?
michael_scott I have no idea.
pam_beesly So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. It is so on.
pam_beesly Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?
oscar_martinez Stop it! Michael.
jim_halpert Michael, that is hilarious.
michael_scott Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
oscar_martinez The best. Great friends. Thank you, Michael.
jim_halpert Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
pam_beesly Aww.
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly That's cool. Mm, good stuff.
jim_halpert You look really pretty.
pam_beesly Thank you.
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly Michael?
michael_scott Yeah?
pam_beesly Hey!
michael_scott Oh, hey.
pam_beesly You got a second?
michael_scott I do.
pam_beesly Oh, good.
pam_beesly Oh, that must've been so fun.
michael_scott it was fun. We had a good time.
pam_beesly Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?
michael_scott Oh, thank you.
pam_beesly Yeah, is that a new tie?
michael_scott Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
pam_beesly That is amazing!
michael_scott You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott Nine dollars. The boys' department.
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
pam_beesly No way!
michael_scott Look at that. Unh. Unh-unh.
pam_beesly Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.
michael_scott Yes they were.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott They were.
pam_beesly Here's what I was thinking everyone sits on a chair every day...
michael_scott Mmhmm.
pam_beesly But not everyone...
michael_scott Sits on a copier.
pam_beesly Or even uses the copier every day.
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly Yeah, right?
michael_scott Very valid.
pam_beesly ...That's it.
michael_scott All right.
pam_beesly All right, see you later...
michael_scott See ya.
pam_beesly Hot tie guy.
michael_scott Hahaha!... well...
dwight_schrute Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
angela_martin No. I haven't thought of it.
dwight_schrute Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
angela_martin I would like cat.
dwight_schrute Cats don't make butter.
angela_martin I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
dwight_schrute It doesn't make any sense.
angela_martin Yes it does!
andy_bernard Okay, guys!
angela_martin I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
dwight_schrute Cow, goat or sheep.
andy_bernard What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!
jim_halpert You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.
pam_beesly No, copier's great.
jim_halpert Yeah?
pam_beesly Yeah. I have my copies.
jim_halpert There they are.
pam_beesly And I have my original.
jim_halpert You got it.
pam_beesly So suck it.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Okay.
kevin_malone Michael, I got you a hot chocolate. I hope that's okay.
michael_scott Oh, thank you my dear.
kelly_kapoor Wait, Michael! Let me open the door for you.
michael_scott Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
stanley_hudson There he is!
michael_scott There he is! Hello, hello!
phyllis_vance Hello.
michael_scott Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
jim_halpert Oh!
michael_scott Mm! Yeah!
pam_beesly There's that ass!
michael_scott Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
pam_beesly Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!
michael_scott Oh... ah, I almost choked.
dwight_schrute Here's another place.
angela_martin It's beautiful.
andy_bernard Hey-o!
dwight_schrute So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
andy_bernard
angela_martin Hello, I'm Angela Martin, and-
andy_bernard I'm Andy.
angela_martin I work with Dwight.
dwight_schrute He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
andy_bernard What?
dwight_schrute Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, "I do." And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
angela_martin I do.
dwight_schrute And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
hank Got a call about a problem up here.
pam_beesly Did somebody call Hank?
michael_scott Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
hank So, there's no security problem? You know, I hustled up the stairs.
michael_scott Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. Yeah, take as many as you want.
hank Thank you. Thank you. You know, it's nice and warm up here.
michael_scott Yes.
hank So what are we talking about?
michael_scott Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
hank I know what a surplus is.
michael_scott Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
hank Is that the copier?
michael_scott It is, yes.
hank Hmm.
michael_scott What?
hank I was just thinking. Let me see a chair.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly You can try mine.
michael_scott Oh, there we go.
hank Hmm, not much lumbar support.
michael_scott Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
hank On the one hand, this copier is very old. You should see some of the new copiers they have. You would not believe what they do.
michael_scott So, the copier.
hank Well, let me finish.
michael_scott All right, yes.
hank Now the chairs. The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
michael_scott Well, what should I do?
hank ...Let me see the copier again.
michael_scott All right, get out. Get out.
angela_martin Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
dwight_schrute I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
angela_martin What do you mean?
dwight_schrute Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
angela_martin Dwight! That doesn't count!
dwight_schrute Yes, of course it does.
angela_martin No, it doesn't!
dwight_schrute It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
angela_martin I didn't-
dwight_schrute Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
angela_martin We are not married.
dwight_schrute Wha...
angela_martin Take this thing.
dwight_schrute My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
andy_bernard Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? Ow!
david_wallace Michael.
michael_scott Hey David- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
david_wallace Is this why you're calling me?
michael_scott No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- I'm sorry.
david_wallace Okay.
michael_scott Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
david_wallace You want me to weigh in on a minor budget issue?
michael_scott No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
david_wallace Well if I were you, I would just return the surplus and take the bonus.
michael_scott The what now?
david_wallace Branch managers who come in under budget get 15% of the savings.
michael_scott ...Like a tip? $645?!
michael_scott I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.
jim_halpert We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.
michael_scott All right, attention everyone.
jim_halpert Let me call you right back. Okay.
michael_scott I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... working perfectly.
oscar_martinez That's the original.
michael_scott Pam, would you stand up for a sec? Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers? They don't have copiers. They don't even- Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
oscar_martinez Do you know?
michael_scott Do I know what?
oscar_martinez I think you know.
michael_scott Mm, no...
phyllis_vance Know what?
pam_beesly Yeah, know what?
oscar_martinez Does anyone happen to know what 15% of 4300 is?
michael_scott $645.
kevin_malone Michael's a genius.
michael_scott Right.
oscar_martinez Why'd you say dollars?
michael_scott Because that is how my mind works.
oscar_martinez What's 15% of 200? Thank you. Everyone, Michael is returning the surplus so he can keep 15% as a bonus.
jim_halpert Wait, what?
pam_beesly You can do that?
kevin_malone Hey Michael, what's 394 times 5,912?
michael_scott Let's see...
pam_beesly You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?
michael_scott I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
oscar_martinez You're gonna get us a copier then?
michael_scott This is so stupid.
pam_beesly Or chairs?
michael_scott This is so, so stupid. And, God... that's my phone.
stanley_hudson I didn't hear a phone.
michael_scott To be continued!
michael_scott No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
andy_bernard Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. What-
angela_martin Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
andy_bernard Was that hot or what?
pam_beesly So what's it gonna be?
oscar_martinez Michael, you have to make a decision. The day is almost done.
pam_beesly Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
oscar_martinez You are a smart guy. I know you'll do the right thing.
michael_scott You think it's easy?
stanley_hudson It's your job.
michael_scott Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
michael_scott It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- Hey.
pam_beesly Hey.
oscar_martinez Hey, we're going with the chairs.
michael_scott What?
oscar_martinez I just figured I'd rather have new chairs than nothing at all.
pam_beesly Thanks Michael.
michael_scott Good work. I'm proud of you. Mother-
michael_scott What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.
jim_halpert Truce?
pam_beesly Yeah, I guess, since I won.
jim_halpert Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. Totally kidding. I'm gonna need four.
