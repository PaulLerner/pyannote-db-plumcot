michael Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!
phyllis Dancing babies!
michael Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
michael We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so. it's uh, not too shabby.
andy Best ad ever. Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that. I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
jim Nobody tell him!
andy What? No, why?
jim You got it, you're so close!
andy Break me off a piece of that. huh huh huh. br- applesauce.
jim Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think.
andy Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
jim Nope.
andy Football cream. Grr!
michael Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
pam I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
michael Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
michael Hello hello! ad guy 1
 Hey, how ya doin'?
michael michael Scott. ad guy 2
 Hey, Michael.
michael Regional manager. ad guy 2
 Hey Michael, nice to meet you
michael Excited to talk ideas. ad guy 1
 Let's do it, man.
michael You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing. ad guy 1
 That sounds great.
michael All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
michael I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
andy Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
michael He gives the best back rubs in the office.
andy It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
michael Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
stanley Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
michael stanley is hilarious. phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
michael These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
kevin Mama Bear!
michael Who else?
jim I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or. And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
jim You playing that game again?
dwight Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
jim Oh it has losers.
dwight I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.
michael Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further--- ad guy 1
 Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---
michael Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so. ad guy 1
 That all sounds really, really ambitious.
michael Yeah, I know. ad guy 1
 Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
michael Mmm. Okay.
michael That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! Whoa. ad guy 1
 That's what we came up with.
michael Well we can do better than that. ad guy 2
 Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually. ad guy 1
 Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway.
michael The waving? ad guy 1
 Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.
andy I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
dwight We cannot talk about this. because, someone might hear us.
andy We'll use code names.
dwight angela can stay the same, but we'll change andy to Dwight.
andy That's not different enough.
dwight Dwike?
receptionist You have a call from Eddie Murphy.
ryan Hello?
michael Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.
ryan What?
michael Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
ryan I told you not to call about small problems.
michael Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
ryan That's good. They're creative, you're not.
michael I'm creative, Ryan.
ryan It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
michael Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
ryan Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
michael Yeah!
ryan But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
michael Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
michael All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.
michael Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today. ad guy 2
 Okay, when should we come back?
michael How about never hundred hours, sir. ad guy 2
 We were sent here to help out. ad guy 1
 Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude.
michael Hey thanks. Thank you. David
wallace Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people?
michael Yeah, I'm glad you called. ryan is being a little bitch again.
ryan I'm on Michael.
michael What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime. David
wallace This is weird.
michael I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it. David
wallace Okay, I'll see it tomorrow.
michael Okay. And thus, michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
michael Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"?
dwight Yes.
michael Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
jim Who are you talking to, specifically?
kevin I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man.
oscar When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
meredith I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
michael We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
phyllis Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
michael Okay, okay, phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
phyllis Okay.
andy Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
creed She's crazy hot.
andy Well then maybe we should just use angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
angela That's not happening.
angela I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated. . push;
phyllis Bye everyone.
michael Line it up Phyllis.
creed Get her Phyll.

darryl What's rap?
michael Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.
darryl Great.
andy News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
jim Hey.
pam No talk, I'm animating.
jim Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
pam Are you serious?
jim Yeah.
pam Oh my God, he's really in pain.
jim 
pam Who's that?
jim Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
pam He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
jim Not much, it's just for tracking dwight so---
pam Right. you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
jim Yep.

darryl You're on your own, Mike.
michael Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
darryl You just said you hated it.
michael No. I said I hate the, the style.
andy Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
michael Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
andy Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
michael Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
phyllis Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
michael That'a girl.
phyllis So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
michael Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
phyllis No.
michael Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
jim I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
pam Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
jim Okay. Do you want me to stay?
pam No no, you can go home. I'm good.
jim pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
meredith You comin'?
jim I, ah.
meredith Piss or get off the pot!
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
jim Good morning. Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and creed snatched your hash browns.
pam Thank you.
jim You're welcome.
pam I worked until about 2
 45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with michael editing in his office, and dwight watching michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
andy Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
dwight Andy, I can't hear this right now.
andy No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D. "
dwight She called you D?
andy Yeah. D for Andy.
dwight Oh D.
andy Oh D.
dwight Oh D.
andy Oh D!
both Ohhhhhh D! Ohhhh D!
michael I'm about to send the ad to corporate. and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.
pam Yes?
michael Pam, please clear my phone lines.
pam Certainly. Okay, clear.
michael They could call at any second now. Oh God. I better call.
michael Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
everyone Oh!
bartender Hey it seemed like a big hit.
michael No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
jim Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
jim Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it. Michael's
ad It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world. And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time , and bad news isn't always what it seems. Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance. To score. Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world.
everyone 
jim Animation? All her by the way.
bartender Really?
jim I just thought you should---
bartender The animation was cool.
pam Thanks.
bartender Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?
jim Ahh.
kevin Michael, that was fun.
michael That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
andy Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. It's gotta rhyme with "piece. " Fancy Feast! Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.
