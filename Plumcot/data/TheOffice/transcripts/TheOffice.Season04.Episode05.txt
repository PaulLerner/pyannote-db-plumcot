michael_scott Yeah! Everything! Oh it's all good, it's all good. Phyllis!
phyllis_vance Dancing babies!
michael_scott Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
michael_scott We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever. Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.
andy_bernard Best ad ever. Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?
jim_halpert Nobody tell him!
andy_bernard What? No, why?
jim_halpert You got it, you're so close!
andy_bernard Break me off a piece of that... huh huh huh... br- applesauce.
jim_halpert Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
andy_bernard Break me off a piece of that Chrysler car.
jim_halpert Nope.
andy_bernard Football cream. Grr!
michael_scott Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
pam_beesly I'm taking a computer animation class so I could try to do a logo.
michael_scott Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
michael_scott Hello hello!
adman guy 1 Hey, how ya doin'?
michael_scott Michael Scott.
adman guy 2 Hey, Michael.
michael_scott Regional manager.
adman guy 2 Hey Michael, nice to meet you
michael_scott Excited to talk ideas.
adman guy 1 Let's do it, man.
michael_scott You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
adman guy 1 That sounds great.
michael_scott All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.
michael_scott I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?
andy_bernard Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!
michael_scott He gives the best back rubs in the office.
andy_bernard It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy . Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!
michael_scott Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
stanley_hudson Urban? I grew up in a small town. What about me seems urban to you?
michael_scott Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
michael_scott These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.
kevin_malone Mama Bear!
michael_scott Who else?
jim_halpert I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.
jim_halpert You playing that game again?
dwight_schrute Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
jim_halpert Oh it has losers.
dwight_schrute I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.
michael_scott Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison. But we zoom back further---
adman guy 1 Okay I can tell that your time is valuable---
michael_scott Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
adman guy 1 That all sounds really, really ambitious.
michael_scott Yeah, I know.
adman guy 1 Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
michael_scott Mmm. Okay.
michael_scott That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! Whoa.
adman guy 1 That's what we came up with.
michael_scott Well we can do better than that.
adman guy 2 Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.
adman guy 1 Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway.
michael_scott The waving?
adman guy 1 Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.
andy_bernard I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
dwight_schrute We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
andy_bernard We'll use code names.
dwight_schrute Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
andy_bernard That's not different enough.
dwight_schrute Dwike?
koh You have a call from Eddie Murphy.
ryan_howard Hello?
michael_scott Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.
ryan_howard What?
michael_scott Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
ryan_howard I told you not to call about small problems.
michael_scott Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
ryan_howard That's good. They're creative, you're not.
michael_scott I'm creative, Ryan.
ryan_howard It's not part of your job, it's like, maybe you can cook but it doesn't mean you should start a restaurant.
michael_scott Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
ryan_howard Okay, I'm not really interested in that right now. I'm delegating creativity to creative professionals. It's a different skills set. Look, I wasn't good at sales, right?
michael_scott Yeah!
ryan_howard But I'm good at managing people who do sales .
michael_scott Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
michael_scott All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.
michael_scott Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.
adman guy 2 Okay, when should we come back?
michael_scott How about never hundred hours, sir.
adman guy 2 We were sent here to help out.
adman guy 1 Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude.
michael_scott Hey thanks. Thank you.
david_wallace Wallace Michael, David Wallace. What is this about dismissing the ad people?
michael_scott Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
ryan_howard I'm on Michael.
michael_scott What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.
david_wallace Wallace This is weird.
michael_scott I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
david_wallace Wallace Okay, I'll see it tomorrow.
michael_scott Okay. And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
michael_scott Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"?
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
jim_halpert Who are you talking to, specifically?
kevin_malone I kind of know what it's like to be in commercials. My nickname in high school used to be Kool-Aid Man.
oscar_martinez When I was younger I always wanted to be an actor in commercials. Then I realized I had a brain.
meredith_palmer I'm excited about doing the ad, but I'm not really used to doing videos with so many people around.
michael_scott We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously. Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.
phyllis_vance Sue Grafton is at the Steamtown Mall. She's doing a book signing right now.
michael_scott Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
phyllis_vance Okay.
andy_bernard Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?
creed_bratton She's crazy hot.
andy_bernard Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?
angela_martin That's not happening.
angela_martin I find the mystery genre disgusting. I hate being titillated.
phyllis_vance Bye everyone.
michael_scott Line it up Phyllis.
creed_bratton Get her Phyll.
darryl_philbin Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain.
andy_bernard Creed, Kevin, Kelly, Darryl Call Michael or Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs.
darryl_philbin Dunder Mifflin.
andy_bernard Creed, Kevin, Kelly The people person's paper people.
darryl_philbin Dunder Mifflin.
andy_bernard Creed, Kevin, Kelly The people person's paper people.
michael_scott Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
darryl_philbin What's rap?
michael_scott Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.
darryl_philbin Great.
andy_bernard News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly No talk, I'm animating.
jim_halpert Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.
pam_beesly Are you serious?
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Oh my God, he's really in pain.
jim_halpert
pam_beesly Who's that?
jim_halpert Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
pam_beesly He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?
jim_halpert Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---
pam_beesly Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.
jim_halpert Yep.
pam_beesly You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.
jim_halpert I... why don't we go back to this animation.
pam_beesly No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.
jim_halpert Ah, show me how this works.
pam_beesly Oh boy.
darryl_philbin Out of paper, out of stock, there's friendly faces around the block, break loose from the chains that are causing your pain. Call Michael, Stanley, Jim, Dwight or Creed. Call Andy and Kelly for your business paper needs. Call Dunder Mifflin.
andy_bernard Creed, Kevin, Kelly The people person's paper people.
darryl_philbin Dunder Mifflin.
andy_bernard Creed, Kevin, Kelly The people person's paper people.
michael_scott Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
darryl_philbin You're right, it's better than you! It's us! Dunder Mifflin.
andy_bernard Creed, Kevin, Kelly The people person's paper people.
michael_scott No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.
darryl_philbin You're on your own, Mike.
michael_scott Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
darryl_philbin You just said you hated it.
michael_scott No. I said I hate the, the style.
andy_bernard Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.
michael_scott Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
andy_bernard Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.
michael_scott Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
phyllis_vance Well, I got in line to buy Sue Grafton's book and when it came to my turn I asked if she wanted to be in the ad and she said no thank you, but I wasn't supposed to take no for an answer.
michael_scott That'a girl.
phyllis_vance So I kept on asking and they finally threw me out of the store in front of all my friends.
michael_scott Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
phyllis_vance No.
michael_scott Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
jim_halpert I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.
pam_beesly Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.
jim_halpert Okay. Do you want me to stay?
pam_beesly No no, you can go home. I'm good.
jim_halpert Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.
meredith_palmer You comin'?
jim_halpert I, ah...
meredith_palmer Piss or get off the pot!
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
jim_halpert Good morning. Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
pam_beesly Thank you.
jim_halpert You're welcome.
pam_beesly I worked until about 2 45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.
andy_bernard Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
dwight_schrute Andy, I can't hear this right now.
andy_bernard No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D."
dwight_schrute She called you D?
andy_bernard Yeah. D for Andy.
dwight_schrute Oh D.
andy_bernard Oh D.
dwight_schrute Oh D.
andy_bernard Oh D!
all@ Ohhhhhh D! Ohhhh D!
michael_scott I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay.
pam_beesly Yes?
michael_scott Pam, please clear my phone lines.
pam_beesly Certainly. Okay, clear.
michael_scott They could call at any second now. Oh God...I better call.
michael_scott Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!
all@ Oh!
the_bartender Hey it seemed like a big hit.
michael_scott No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
jim_halpert Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?
jim_halpert Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.
adman It all starts with an idea. But you can never tell where an idea will end up. Because ideas spread, they change, grow. They connect us with the world. And in a fast moving world, where good news moves at the speed of time , and bad news isn't always what it seems. Because when push comes to shove we all deserve a second chance. To score. Dunder Mifflin. Limitless paper in a paperless world.
all@
jim_halpert Animation? All her by the way.
the_bartender Really?
jim_halpert I just thought you should---
the_bartender The animation was cool.
pam_beesly Thanks.
the_bartender Hey listen, you ever been on a motorcycle?
jim_halpert Ahh.
kevin_malone Michael, that was fun.
michael_scott That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
andy_bernard Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. It's gotta rhyme with "piece." Fancy Feast! Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.
