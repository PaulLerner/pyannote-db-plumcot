michael_scott I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit. I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go. Feeling good. Listen to some tunes. Should've peed before I left.
kelly_kapoor Michael get to the good part.
michael_scott Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door.
oscar_martinez At least he is in the building.
michael_scott No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
all@
pam_beesly He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
pam_beesly Okay focus. Focus. You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
michael_scott I looked at Wallace and I said "I quit!" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said "You have no idea how high I can fly."
stanley_hudson Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
michael_scott Why would I do that?
angela_martin Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
kevin_malone That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
meredith_palmer Did you spit in his face?
michael_scott You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
oscar_martinez I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life. Gives me hope. Maybe I will have one of own someday. But I dream... so...
jim_halpert About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
kevin_malone Michael is that scotch?
michael_scott Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on.
michael_scott What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that. I gonna stay up all day. Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO! And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.
stanley_hudson Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
michael_scott I have a job.
andy_bernard For four more days.
pam_beesly Do you have any leads on a job?
michael_scott Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted.
jim_halpert You called any headhunters?
michael_scott Any good headhunter knows I am available.
dwight_schrute Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
jim_halpert Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
charles_miner Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
michael_scott You're 'I need you to' is my command.
charles_miner Okay.
andy_bernard Hey Michael...
michael_scott Hey.
andy_bernard Can I talk to you a minute?
michael_scott You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
andy_bernard I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What? What's that?
michael_scott Oh! Hey. What is this about?
andy_bernard Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
michael_scott Oh.
andy_bernard I hope I get to work with you someday again.
michael_scott Me too, me too. Is this wine?
andy_bernard Ah... busted. Yes
michael_scott I already have wine.
andy_bernard Oh.

pam_beesly I'm working on it Kev.
kevin_malone You said it would be ready by today. And it is today.
pam_beesly It'll be ready soon.
kevin_malone Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
pam_beesly Is that what 'soon' means to you?
kevin_malone Sometimes.
pam_beesly Then come back soon.
pam_beesly During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
creed_bratton I think it's 75 cents.
oscar_martinez That's a lot.
angela_martin Bandit, No! No no no!
kevin_malone Oh!
pam_beesly Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting.
jim_halpert Its Monster dot com. Singular.
michael_scott Thank you.
michael_scott You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players.
Phone#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode19 Hi, you've reached Prince Paper. We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community we are no longer in business. Thank you for your support. May God bless you. Bye!

michael_scott PSST! PSST!
jim_halpert Yeah... .you want me to come in your office? Oh.
michael_scott Okay, oh okay, okay. Close your eyes.
jim_halpert I would prefer not to.
michael_scott Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
jim_halpert You're starting your own paper company?
michael_scott yeah!
jim_halpert Why?
michael_scott Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper.
jim_halpert Do you know the industry is in decline?
michael_scott Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
jim_halpert Right.
michael_scott Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
jim_halpert No, I did that before, it added nothing.
michael_scott Close them.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
jim_halpert I am not gonna do this.
michael_scott Obviously.
jim_halpert And you are not going to, either.
michael_scott Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
jim_halpert Here's the thing. What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary. Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
michael_scott Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
charles_miner Jim.
jim_halpert Hey.
charles_miner what are you doing?
jim_halpert Nothing, just talking.
charles_miner Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
jim_halpert I didn't... no.
charles_miner Okay. After you.
michael_scott No I'm staying.
charles_miner Okay.
dwight_schrute Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
pam_beesly No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
dwight_schrute Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II.
pam_beesly That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
dwight_schrute Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
pam_beesly Hmm...
dwight_schrute My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
michael_scott Pam, listen. This order form. Instead of saying "Dunder Mifflin" at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
pam_beesly Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
michael_scott You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.
pam_beesly Hmm... yeah. Listen Michael. Have you really thought this through? 'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
michael_scott This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
pam_beesly Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
michael_scott Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?
pam_beesly Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
michael_scott Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
pam_beesly Yeah. Good.
michael_scott Thank you very much.
pam_beesly Mmm-hmm
kelly_kapoor So that is why I have to leave at 5 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school. We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
charles_miner You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
kelly_kapoor Yeah I don't like talking...
charles_miner Come in...
angela_martin I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone. I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about. Earlier.
kelly_kapoor Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
angela_martin Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar. I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
charles_miner Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
angela_martin and Kelly Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like 'Come on in!"
charles_miner I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
kelly_kapoor So you should be heading back to your desk.
angela_martin Okay. Bye Charles. Well you'll let me know. Good bye.
kelly_kapoor She's such a special person. And she's turning 50 this year.
michael_scott I'm starting my own paper company.
andy_bernard No way!?
michael_scott Yeah.
andy_bernard In this climate?
michael_scott Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.
andy_bernard Ehh... well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm.. Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
dwight_schrute Your own paper company.
michael_scott Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
dwight_schrute Right...
michael_scott Potential, lots of potential. yes.
dwight_schrute What a courageous venture.
michael_scott It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
dwight_schrute Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
michael_scott That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
dwight_schrute Okay. So yeah.
michael_scott So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.
dwight_schrute You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
pam_beesly Everyone, can I have your attention. This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right?
meredith_palmer Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
pam_beesly Meredith... Oh... so uh... G-44. It's not ready Kevin!
pam_beesly I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
oscar_martinez
oscar_martinez You put a note in my food?
michael_scott I made it sterile.
oscar_martinez Just to say "sterile" doesn't make it so.
michael_scott I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
oscar_martinez Do you have a business plan? A funding request? Market research, financials?
michael_scott No, no no.
oscar_martinez You need those things. Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years. And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years. Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
michael_scott Okay.
oscar_martinez Five years?
michael_scott Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me.
oscar_martinez It's just not prudent Michael.
michael_scott Stanley?
stanley_hudson Can't you see I'm urinating?
michael_scott Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
stanley_hudson No.
michael_scott Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
stanley_hudson No.
michael_scott Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
stanley_hudson No I didn't.
michael_scott You know what. I had a great time at prom. And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
pam_beesly How's it working?
phyllis_vance Um, let's see... it's fine.
pam_beesly Good.
pam_beesly I did it. I learned everything about this machine. I know all the buttons, even the inside ones. I know all the error messages. I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors. Which feels...
charles_miner Hey Hank, You ready?
hank Yeah.
charles_miner Okay, Michael?
michael_scott Hmm?
charles_miner I can't pretend I haven't seen that. So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk out. And you can't take anything.
michael_scott Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...
charles_miner not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
hank Okay Michael.
michael_scott Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
hank Come on man, let's, let's go.
kevin_malone I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy. And he's super funny. Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes. He's all the way over there.
michael_scott Well here we are... I would just like to...
charles_miner No, no no no. You're done, Michael.
michael_scott Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!
andy_bernard What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
kevin_malone I think he's singing.
oscar_martinez I can't believe this is really happening.
michael_scott ... and I feel free!
oscar_martinez And just like that. As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone.
andy_bernard The whole office feels darker, you know? It's just a sad dark day.
phyllis_vance Andy He's gone.
andy_bernard I know.
phyllis_vance You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
toby_flenderson Michael is like a movie on a plane. You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch. And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
pam_beesly Michael?
michael_scott Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
angela_martin These are for employees only.
michael_scott Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
kevin_malone Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
michael_scott I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere.
kevin_malone But you didn't want to start with us?
michael_scott No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?
jim_halpert I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
michael_scott So which way are you leaning?
jim_halpert Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
michael_scott Thanks Jim.
charles_miner Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
dwight_schrute No.
charles_miner Okay, let me know if you find it.
michael_scott Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be? Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis. Here we go, here we go!
charles_miner Michael get up!
michael_scott Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
charles_miner Michael, what are you doing?
michael_scott I think maybe Hank should be here.
charles_miner Hank? No, I don't need Hank Michael.
michael_scott You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.
pam_beesly Oh no.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly I'm going with him.
jim_halpert What? Pam!
pam_beesly I'm going.
jim_halpert Pam! You can't be serious.
pam_beesly Michael, wait! I'm coming with you.
michael_scott You are?
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott Okay. It's going to be great.
pam_beesly Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
michael_scott Right... Executive assistant.
pam_beesly Salesman.
michael_scott Alright, okay. Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
jim_halpert Still no.
michael_scott Well, okay, lets go.
pam_beesly Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
michael_scott Are people watching?
pam_beesly Probably.
jim_halpert Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
michael_scott Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.
jim_halpert I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
pam_beesly Okay, see you later.
michael_scott Bye.
charles_miner So, we had a personnel change today. Shouldn't effect our day to day. But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
kevin_malone Phones?
charles_miner Also, there has been too much wasted time. So Stanley.
stanley_hudson Yes.
charles_miner Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay? I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good. Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay?
