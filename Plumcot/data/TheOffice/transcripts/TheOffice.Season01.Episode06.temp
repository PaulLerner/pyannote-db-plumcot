question Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to.
jan No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
michael I didn't mean me!

dwight Torture.

pam Okay.
michael Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
katy This one is hand embroidered.
michael All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.

katy Wow, thanks.
pam There's an HR meeting in there at 11
 30.
michael Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
michael I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.
michael This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.
michael So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.
katy I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
michael Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
katy What?
michael It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
katy Regular coffee is fine.
michael Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb
katy No really it is.
michael No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
katy Bring it on.
michael Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
kevin So are you jealous 'cause there's another girl around?
pam No.
kevin She's prettier than you though.
pam That's a very rude thing to say, Kevin.
kevin 
katy So do you like the periwinkle and the purples?
dwight The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
michael There ya go. Nice steaming cup o'joe.
katy Thank you.
michael I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
katy Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um.

katy That was on Sesame Street.
michael I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?

jim pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh. Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.
jim She'd be perfect for you.
dwight Hmmm. she's been talking to michael a lot.
jim So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
dwight Assistant to the Regional Manager.
jim Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
dwight That's true.
jim Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
dwight True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
jim It's all gold.
katy Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.
jim Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
dwight What's that?
jim You buy a purse.
dwight I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
jim Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
dwight No.
jim Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.
dwight Like those?
jim Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
dwight Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going.
jim No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.
jim Okay, shhhh stop. stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.
pam 
jim Hi my name's dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?
pam Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.
jim Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.
pam Oh!
jim Oh! That was really. This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh. This is the prettiest one of all.

jim Here he comes, shhh.
jim Good.
pam 
jim He did pick a good one.

pam Yeah, what's that?
katy 
pam I'm engaged. So.
katy Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.
pam I wished, right?
michael Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?
katy Good.
michael Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
katy Sorry.
michael Busted.
katy Come back.
michael Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
katy Is that from Starbucks?
michael Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
katy Wow. Is that for the office?
michael Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
katy I wouldn't think of it.
michael Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper! . push;
michael Oh the rotating um, steam wand. What? What's the matter?
katy Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me.
michael Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there. ?
katy Oh no, it's um.
michael Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
katy No.
michael Seriously. No, really.
katy No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.
michael God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.
katy At five?
michael I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.
katy Okay.
michael What?
katy Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
michael Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
katy Okay. Cool.
michael Excellent.
katy Cool.
michael Great. Cool. Cool. Yeah, okay.
michael I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So.
dwight It's actually better this way.
michael No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
dwight michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because.
michael No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
dwight Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
michael But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
dwight What?
michael She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
dwight Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
michael Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot.
dwight Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
michael No. I cannot promise you that.
dwight You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
michael Listen, Dwight.
dwight Do you love her?
michael Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel.
katy I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.
stanley Hmmm.
michael Espresso?
katy Oh, thank you.
michael You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
stanley Is that from the machine that was in your office?
michael Ummm-hmmm.
stanley I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
michael Very easy to clean.
michael Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right?
michael Did we get any mail?
pam Yeah, I gave it to you.
michael Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and.
pam So, can I. ?
michael Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
jim A futon?
pam 
jim He's a grown man
pam That's what he said.
jim That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one.
roy What's up?

katy You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?
angela I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just. I'm shopping.

michael Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
ryan Do you want this?
michael No.
ryan What about this bottle of power drink?
michael Uh, what flavor?
ryan Blue.
michael Blue's not a flavor.
ryan It says

jim Hi.
katy Hi.
jim I'm Jim, by the way.
katy I'm Katy.

jim I do. That's what I'm best known for. Sitting out there. Alright, let's talk about purses.
katy Okay, um.
jim katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn.
katy Okay.
jim Okay, so I know about most of these, but you know you can.
katy Okay.

jim Oh, man I don't know. Uh, dinner, drinks, movie, matching tattoos.
pam That's great.
jim And stuff. yeah.
pam That's cool.

jim That's cool.
pam Uh, huh. Yes.
jim That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right?
pam Great.
jim Okay.
pam Okay, I'm gonna head back.
jim Alright.
michael I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right? I don't know.
michael Sure you don't want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.
katy Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
michael See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
jim Goodnight, Michael.
michael Where you going?
jim I don't know. Grab a drink, I think?
michael With us?
katy I uh, I probably should have told you, I don't need a ride now 'cause jim can take me home after so you're off the hook.
michael Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
jim I got this.
michael Alright, have fun.
katy Thanks.
jim I got it.
michael Don't drink and drive.
michael Take it easy.
jim Have a good night.
michael You too, have a good night.
katy You got that?
jim Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it's lighter.
katy Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
jim Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?
katy Why?
jim This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
katy It's a. it's a very nice car.
jim You're not going to freak out?
michael Do I have a special someone? Uh well, yeah of course. A bunch of 'em. My employees. If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.
