karen_filippelli So do you want to see it or not?
jim_halpert I don't know. Feel like... Friday night crowds...
karen_filippelli Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.
jim_halpert Agoraphobic?
karen_filippelli Yeah.
jim_halpert Really?
karen_filippelli Yeah! You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
jim_halpert Absolutely correct.
kevin_malone Later, Jim.
jim_halpert Kev, have a good weekend.
karen_filippelli Bye. Ok, so this is what's gonna happen. You're gonna suck it up.
jim_halpert Here we go...
karen_filippelli ...and we're gonna go to dinner.
jim_halpert Ok...
karen_filippelli And then we're gonna go to the movies.
jim_halpert Sounds good.
roy_anderson Hey Halpert!
jim_halpert Hey...
pam_beesly ROY!
karen_filippelli
pam_beesly Roy don't!
roy_anderson Ahh God!
dwight_schrute Pam, please call security!
dwight_schrute Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?
michael_scott No need for consternation, everything is under control.
jan_levinson Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
michael_scott It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
jan_levinson Is Toby there?
michael_scott No...
toby_flenderson I'm... here, Jan.
jan_levinson Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
toby_flenderson Well, we fired Roy, obviously. And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
jan_levinson Thank God.
toby_flenderson Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
michael_scott No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
jan_levinson All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
michael_scott Yeppers.
jan_levinson What did I tell you about "yeppers?"
michael_scott I don't... remember.
jan_levinson I told you not to say it. Do you remember that?
michael_scott Yeesh...
pam_beesly I really don't want to talk about it. I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened. It sucked.
jim_halpert I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there. And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray. And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
jim_halpert Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
jim_halpert Okay. Um... Got you something.
dwight_schrute Don't want it.
jim_halpert You don't know what it is.
dwight_schrute Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
jim_halpert It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead. That would have made us even, I think. He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy. Even Steven.
dwight_schrute No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.
oscar_martinez Angela, Roy's check. He's coming in later to pick it up.
kevin_malone Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
oscar_martinez It was crazy.
angela_martin You saw it? Describe it please.
oscar_martinez Well, I heard some shouting. And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody. Jim says something. Roy stomps over there. All of the sudden, BAM. Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
angela_martin Oh...
oscar_martinez It was insane!
angela_martin Well... good for Dwight.
michael_scott Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
jim_halpert Where'd you get that?
michael_scott Wikipedia.
michael_scott Wikipedia... is the best thing ever. Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
michael_scott Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
jim_halpert Hey, Mike. Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
michael_scott Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think... that maybe you should...
jim_halpert I can't hear you.
michael_scott What I'm saying is that,
jim_halpert Still nothin'.
michael_scott Ok, see what I did?
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
jim_halpert Nice.
michael_scott Ok, let's try another one. Um...
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
jim_halpert And what happens in this one?
michael_scott It's a surprise.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
jim_halpert Can I have a raise?
michael_scott
jim_halpert s*x, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert What?
michael_scott No, what did you say?
jim_halpert I didn't say anything. I was waiting to see what happened.
michael_scott Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
dwight_schrute I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
toby_flenderson Which is where?
dwight_schrute Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.
toby_flenderson Thanks Dwight.
kelly_kapoor That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
ryan_howard I can't imagine what I would have done.
kelly_kapoor I can. You would have left me to fend for myself. Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
ryan_howard Well that was funny, that's why.
kelly_kapoor Oh it was?
ryan_howard Mm-hmm.
kelly_kapoor Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
ryan_howard Okay.
kelly_kapoor ...and you call me, to calm you down...
ryan_howard You know what? I didn't---
toby_flenderson Can you stop...
kelly_kapoor ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not.
toby_flenderson There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
ryan_howard Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
toby_flenderson Guys...
kelly_kapoor I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
toby_flenderson I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly. But, if he did intend that? Wow. Genius.
michael_scott Yeah.
darryl_philbin You ready for me?
michael_scott Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.
darryl_philbin Cool.
michael_scott You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room.
darryl_philbin Okay.
michael_scott No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
michael_scott Tactic number six. Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Totally throws 'em off.
michael_scott Number 14, declining to speak first. Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
michael_scott I am declining to speak first.
darryl_philbin Okay, I'll start. It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise. I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
michael_scott Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
darryl_philbin Are you wearin' lady clothes?
michael_scott What?
darryl_philbin Are you wearin' lady clothes? Those look like lady... pants.
michael_scott No, this is a power suit.
darryl_philbin That there's a woman's suit.
michael_scott I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.
darryl_philbin I'ma call Roy, man.
michael_scott Ohh... kay.
darryl_philbin This is gonna make him feel better.
michael_scott All right.
darryl_philbin This is too good.
michael_scott Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
pam_beesly Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!
kevin_malone You're wearing a woman's suit?
michael_scott No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.
michael_scott There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one. And it fit! So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit. At the very least it's bisexual.
kevin_malone Who makes it?
michael_scott Uh, MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
phyllis_vance Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
michael_scott Okay.
phyllis_vance Did you see...
michael_scott Would you stop it, please?
jim_halpert So, none of that tipped you off?
michael_scott It's European, OK? It's a European cut.
pam_beesly Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
michael_scott No, they don't. See?
pam_beesly
michael_scott Italians don't wear pockets.
pam_beesly It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
karen_filippelli Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
michael_scott No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
darryl_philbin Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
michael_scott Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
darryl_philbin Okay, can you just stand right there? I gotta send some e-mails.
michael_scott Negotiations are all about controlling things. About being in the driver's seat. And make one tiny mistake, you're dead. I made one tiny mistake. I wore woman's clothes.
kevin_malone Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
karen_filippelli I feel great, Kevin. Thank you.
stanley_hudson You must have been scared out of your mind.
karen_filippelli Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
angela_martin What happened, exactly? I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
karen_filippelli Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
angela_martin Mm-hmm.
karen_filippelli And he's a big dude, you know? And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
angela_martin Goodness.
karen_filippelli When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings. Roy just attacked him. I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
michael_scott Let's get down to business. Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
darryl_philbin Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right? So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to. With Roy gone we got a smaller crew. And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
michael_scott
darryl_philbin What? I can't hear you.
michael_scott That was a very good point.
darryl_philbin I can't--- what, Mike? Are you---
michael_scott You make a very compelling argument.
pam_beesly Sorry I almost got you killed.
jim_halpert Yeah, that was nuts.
pam_beesly He could have broken your nose or something. Crazy. It's just so stupid. I mean, getting back with Roy and everything. I mean, what was I thinking, right?
jim_halpert No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
pam_beesly Not anymore. It's, um... It's completely over now.
jim_halpert We'll see. I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
pam_beesly Jim... I am really... sorry.
jim_halpert Oh, yeah. Don't worry about it.
michael_scott I am going to give you a piece of paper. I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
darryl_philbin Why can't I just... tell you?
michael_scott Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films. No, slide--- slide it, yes.
darryl_philbin There you go.
michael_scott Oh. Come on. Be serious.
darryl_philbin I am serious, Mike. That's a 10% raise. That's what I want.
michael_scott I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
darryl_philbin Come on, be for real Mike.
michael_scott I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.
darryl_philbin Are you serious? You're earning this?
michael_scott Plus perks, yes.
darryl_philbin Mike, this is barely more than I make. You been here ten years, dog.
michael_scott Fourteen years.
darryl_philbin Ho-ho!
michael_scott No, please, please...
darryl_philbin Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one. Ah.
michael_scott Ok, let's take 15, again.
michael_scott A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks. It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
jim_halpert Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
dwight_schrute When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
jim_halpert Boy I---
dwight_schrute No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
jim_halpert It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming. But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel. I just can't grab onto him. It's infuriating.
karen_filippelli Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
jim_halpert Well... yes, that's probably what it is. So what do I do?
karen_filippelli Hmm... I don't know. Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
kevin_malone Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
michael_scott Oh, thank you.
kevin_malone Yeah. I heard you might need it. So...
creed_bratton Here's the $40 you gave me.
michael_scott I didn't give you $40.
creed_bratton In a way you did.
stanley_hudson Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes. I still think he's way overpaid.
darryl_philbin Fourteen years. Fourteen. I know. Ok, alright. I gotta go. Later.
michael_scott Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.
darryl_philbin What?
michael_scott I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
darryl_philbin That's 'cause of you, Mike. They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
michael_scott Well what am I supposed to do?
darryl_philbin Get your own raise. You gotta get out there and earn, son.
michael_scott I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.
darryl_philbin Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put you in charge. Okay, and we're shippin' more now than we ever have.
michael_scott That's true.
darryl_philbin Yeah that's true. You gotta call your girl, and get paid. Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
michael_scott You know what? I should.
darryl_philbin Yeah, you should.
michael_scott I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
darryl_philbin Fourteen years long.
michael_scott You know what? I deserve a bump.
darryl_philbin Make it happen, cap'in.
michael_scott I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
creed_bratton I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11 30. Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what. I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car. Something like that. So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels. Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
angela_martin You're useless.
jan_levinson Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
michael_scott No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.
jan_levinson Today. All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
michael_scott Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.
jan_levinson Great. Uh, and listen. Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
michael_scott Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
jan_levinson Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
michael_scott Mm-hm.
jan_levinson No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep. So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
michael_scott Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
jan_levinson Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
michael_scott No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
jan_levinson ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship. You know this. Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
michael_scott Fine.
kelly_kapoor You are so mean.
ryan_howard I don't know what you're talking about.
kelly_kapoor Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard. You called me stupid.
ryan_howard No, I said your idea was stupid.
michael_scott Toby, come on. Let's go.
toby_flenderson Where?
michael_scott Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.
kelly_kapoor What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
toby_flenderson Alright.
kelly_kapoor Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
ryan_howard Don't you see why that's insane?
kelly_kapoor Oh, so I'm crazy now?
darryl_philbin Comfortable, Mike?
michael_scott Yeah. Fine.
darryl_philbin How about you, man. Comfortable?
toby_flenderson No.
michael_scott Don't ever touch a black man's radio! ...Chris Tucker. Rush Hour. I won't touch yours, by the way.
darryl_philbin Thank you.
michael_scott Well...
darryl_philbin I haven't been to New York in a long time.
michael_scott Mm, the Big Apple.
darryl_philbin Maybe I'll stay overnight. Got a cousin lives down there.
toby_flenderson How would we get home?
darryl_philbin Oh you could stay too. He's got a big place.
michael_scott Maybe I'll stay.
darryl_philbin Mm, it's not that big.
michael_scott Well...
darryl_philbin Busses, though. They get you home quick.
michael_scott Oh, I...
kelly_kapoor And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like "No!"
angela_martin Then what'd he do?
kelly_kapoor You should just read the report that Toby did. He took everyone's stories. Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly. Oh yeah I could totally help you with that. Ok, let me just get the folder out. Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper. Oh, 12 reams...
hunter Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.
darryl_philbin Okay, bring it home now. And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
michael_scott Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
darryl_philbin Yes sir. Remember that. I'll be right outside if you need me
michael_scott All right.
darryl_philbin Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases. I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
roy_anderson Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. Thanks. Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
pam_beesly I don't know.
roy_anderson Please. I just got some stuff I gotta say to you.
kevin_malone Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
jim_halpert Thanks, Kev. I'm good though.
jan_levinson Thank you, Hunter. Hello. Come in. Ah, Okay.
michael_scott Who's the boy toy?
jan_levinson That's my new assistant.
michael_scott Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
jan_levinson I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
michael_scott Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
toby_flenderson Hi, Jan.
jan_levinson Hi, Toby. First--- First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation. All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside. Are we clear?
michael_scott Pippity poppity.
jan_levinson Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
michael_scott Six percent? After all we've been through?
jan_levinson Oh, God.
michael_scott I got you... jade earrings.
jan_levinson Michael---
michael_scott No!
jan_levinson Michael---
michael_scott No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x. What are you writing, perv-ball?
toby_flenderson Just preparing for the deposition.
toby_flenderson This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold s*x from a female superior. It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
roy_anderson I'm so sorry, Pammy. I really wasn't gonna do anything. But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and... I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
pam_beesly I'm sorry too. I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
roy_anderson So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
pam_beesly Um... no. No, he has a girlfriend.
roy_anderson Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
pam_beesly No, there were a lot of reasons.
roy_anderson But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? I don't get you Pam.
pam_beesly I know.
dwight_schrute What's this?
jim_halpert What's what?
dwight_schrute Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute"
jim_halpert Wow. I guess word got around. That's a nice... honor.
dwight_schrute Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
jim_halpert Didn't think you'd notice...
michael_scott Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart. This is me, Jan. This is me!
jan_levinson Okay, Michael. Please, why don't we just take a break. This is really going nowhere.
michael_scott Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.
jan_levinson Ok, Toby, how about if you...
toby_flenderson Sure.
jan_levinson Great.
jan_levinson What's wrong with you?
michael_scott Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---
jan_levinson Okay, Michael. I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
michael_scott Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
jan_levinson No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it. Okay?
michael_scott Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise.
jan_levinson No. But we can offer you 12.
michael_scott But you just said 15.
michael_scott Negotiation is an art. Back and forth. Give and take. And today, both Darryl and I took something. Higher salaries. Win win win. But you know, life is about more... than just salaries. It's about perks. Like having s*x with Jan--
jan_levinson Michael!
stanley_hudson So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
phyllis_vance Mm-hmm, near the river.
stanley_hudson Mm, how many bedrooms?
phyllis_vance Four.
angela_martin Dwight. Dwight. I've been doing some very interesting reading.
dwight_schrute Really?
angela_martin Mm-hmm. Tales of bravery.
dwight_schrute Mm, good stuff.
angela_martin Mm-hmm. I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
dwight_schrute Sounds... fun.
jim_halpert I... will never say a word. And now, we are even.
andy_bernard I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell. On time. Now I'm back. Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it. So look out Dunder Mifflin! I mean, look out... in a fun way! You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...
andy_bernard Hey guys! Guess who's back! AHHH! OH, GOD!
dwight_schrute No need to thank me.
dwight_schrute I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono.
