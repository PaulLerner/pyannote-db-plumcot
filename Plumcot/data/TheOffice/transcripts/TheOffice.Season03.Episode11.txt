jim_halpert All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... what is this?
dwight_schrute Tape recorder.
jim_halpert For what?
dwight_schrute For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
jim_halpert OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
karen_filippelli Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
jim_halpert Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
dwight_schrute I'm not.
jim_halpert Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
dwight_schrute I do not have a knife!
jim_halpert No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
dwight_schrute Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
jim_halpert Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
dwight_schrute Give me it. I am not.
phyllis_vance Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
dwight_schrute Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
karen_filippelli Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
jim_halpert Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
dwight_schrute You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
andy_bernard I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
michael_scott Hey, mon!
pam_beesly Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
michael_scott Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
pam_beesly OK.
michael_scott Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.
pam_beesly It's kind of serious.
michael_scott Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
pam_beesly How was Jamaica?
michael_scott It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon," everybody says "Hey mon" back.
stanley_hudson Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
michael_scott Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
stanley_hudson My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
michael_scott OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
stanley_hudson They said I should talk to you.
michael_scott Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...
stanley_hudson I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
michael_scott You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
jim_halpert You want to talk about it?
karen_filippelli Nope.
karen_filippelli I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a "for rent" sign down the street from Jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
michael_scott Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.
pam_beesly That's good.
michael_scott You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
pam_beesly Huh.
michael_scott Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
pam_beesly It's kind of an impoverished country.
michael_scott Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
pam_beesly But you can't today, we're doing inventory.
michael_scott Inventory's at the end of December.
pam_beesly We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
michael_scott I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
michael_scott Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
michael_scott Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
angela_martin By the end of the day? That's impossible.
michael_scott The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible."
jim_halpert Yep, it's English, it's "impossible."
angela_martin Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
michael_scott How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.
michael_scott Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem." This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
pam_beesly Oh my God. Is that Jan?
all@ What? Where?
pam_beesly On the left.
all@ Oh yeah, oh my God.
michael_scott No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
michael_scott Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. s*x. We had s*x. I had s*x with her. I had s*x with Jan.
michael_scott Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
todd_packer Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
michael_scott Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
todd_packer You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
michael_scott Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
todd_packer They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
michael_scott Oh no?
todd_packer No.
michael_scott OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
todd_packer Well, no. I got nothing.
michael_scott Check it again. Hit refresh.
todd_packer Yeah, Mike, still nothing.
michael_scott OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... Packer@DunderMifflin.com. Packaging@DunderMifflin.com. Uh oh.
todd_packer Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
michael_scott Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
roy_anderson He's in the office.
michael_scott OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
darryl_philbin All right, what's up Mike?
michael_scott That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
darryl_philbin Yup.
michael_scott OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
darryl_philbin Uh huh.
michael_scott OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
darryl_philbin Yup.
michael_scott And you sent that out to everyone?
darryl_philbin Mike, I'm very busy down here.
jim_halpert Yikes.
kevin_malone Already sent it to you my friend.
jim_halpert Fantastic.
andy_bernard Boring. Call me if she rolls over.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly You OK?
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly You sure?
jim_halpert Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
pam_beesly Oh. You want to talk about it?
jim_halpert Really?
michael_scott I have a special assignment for you.
dwight_schrute Who's the target?
michael_scott A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
dwight_schrute What's it of?
michael_scott Not important.
dwight_schrute Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
michael_scott OK, forget it.
dwight_schrute OK, I accept it.
jim_halpert So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
pam_beesly Hmm.
jim_halpert Hmm, what?
pam_beesly How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
jim_halpert Yeah, I guess.
pam_beesly Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
pam_beesly No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
jim_halpert Hey, thanks a lot.
pam_beesly Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
jim_halpert Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?
toby_flenderson Hey I need to talk to you right now.
michael_scott Not now, not ever.
toby_flenderson About you and Jan.
michael_scott Aww, none of your business.
toby_flenderson Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
michael_scott That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
toby_flenderson Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife... we don't talk now.
michael_scott This is probably the icebreaker you need.
toby_flenderson You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
michael_scott I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
toby_flenderson All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
michael_scott No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
toby_flenderson All right, thanks Michael.
michael_scott OK.
angela_martin OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
karen_filippelli What are the ingredients of poi?
phyllis_vance I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
angela_martin Did you try the petting zoo?
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.
michael_scott Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
pam_beesly He'll call you back. OK, great.
michael_scott She bought it? OK. OK.
dwight_schrute Michael hit a deer?
dwight_schrute Michael! Michael! There's an emergency in the warehouse.
michael_scott There an accident? Somebody hurt?
dwight_schrute No, it's... involves the photograph.
michael_scott Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
roy_anderson Mike, you are a rock star, man. You are the man! Well done.
michael_scott All right.
roy_anderson That corporate booty, he likes to hit it!
michael_scott Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---
kevin_malone Jan.
michael_scott No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
jim_halpert Urkel Grue.
michael_scott My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
michael_scott Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot!
pam_beesly Hey.
michael_scott Hey.
pam_beesly What are you doing out here?
michael_scott Island living. You know?
pam_beesly Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.
michael_scott Did she say what it's about?
pam_beesly That's all she said.
andy_bernard Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot
jim_halpert Uh, I think you dropped this
karen_filippelli You sure?
jim_halpert Definitely.
dwight_schrute I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
michael_scott There are copies in the bathroom?
dwight_schrute There were. A lot of them.
michael_scott All right.
karen_filippelli I think I owe you one.
pam_beesly Sorry?
karen_filippelli For talking sense into Halpert. The Day's Inn room 228 was starting to get really depressing.
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.
karen_filippelli Yeah, but... thanks. Seriously.
pam_beesly Sure.
darryl_philbin Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
dwight_schrute Who did this to you? Where is he?
pam_beesly What? No, it's not... it's nothing.
dwight_schrute It's hot in here.
pam_beesly Yeah.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
pam_beesly Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
dwight_schrute I know. So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
jan_levinson Hello everyone. Hello Michael.
michael_scott Guh.
kevin_malone Hi Jan, you look... tan.
jan_levinson I was in Scottsdale visiting my sister.
kevin_malone Yeah. How was it?
jan_levinson Very sunny. Family's important. Michael, I would like to speak with you, in your office.
michael_scott OK, yup.
jan_levinson Why am I here, Michael?
michael_scott I...
jan_levinson In the last year, I've gone through a divorce, an identity theft, a husband who would not... communicate. This is nether here or there. My psychiatrist thinks that I have some self-destructive tendencies and that for once, I should indulge them. You following me?
michael_scott I... I... Yes.
jan_levinson I think I owe it to myself to find some kind of happiness, you know? I mean, even, even if it means... lowering my expectations or, or redefining the word, itself.
michael_scott OK, yeah.
jan_levinson This is the kind of thing, you know? I am... attracted to you. I, I don't know why, I... but, I am. And, I need to follow my instincts. At least that's what Dr. Perry thinks.
michael_scott Who is Dr. Perry? I...
jan_levinson This is the point, OK? You're wrong for me. In... In... every way. But I still find myself wanting to... be with you.
michael_scott And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
jan_levinson Good, good.
michael_scott So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
jan_levinson Well, good, OK. Thank you... for taking the time...
michael_scott Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -
jan_levinson Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse, and meet me at your condo.
michael_scott Jan, you... complete... me.
jan_levinson Oh, God.
roy_anderson Hey, remember when we were planning our honeymoon and you wanted to go to Hawaii and I wanted to go to Mexico?
pam_beesly Yeah.
roy_anderson I was definitely right. Oh, brother.
kevin_malone What am I going to do? I'm gonna hang it up at home. I don't have a lot of art.
