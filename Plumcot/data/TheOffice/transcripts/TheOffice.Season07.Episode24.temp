pam We could get Deangelo flowers.
dwight No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
phyllis That's true.
jim all in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?
dwight Wait, wait. all in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?
jim Nope. Baskets have it.
jim So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
jim Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her. I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
dwight dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan, gather my things from my desk.
jim Wait.
pam What have you done?
dwight Mose. you'll never guess where I am right now.
mose Aaaaahhhhh!
pam Can't stay there all day.
jim I'm coming.
pam Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
jim You'd slow me down.
jim dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10
 30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
pam Stop stalling! Come on.
all I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation. all but
oscar . under God.
all . indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
angela Amen.
dwight Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving gabe and myself.
erin Ooh, about what?
dwight That's on a need-to-know basis.
erin I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
dwight General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
jim Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
dwight Define foment.
jim You define foment.
dwight Please take note of the new color-coding system.
dwight Aha!
kelly Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
dwight Gotcha! Why are you late?
kelly It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
dwight all right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.
andy In fairness, darryl did tell me that joke, so.
erin Oh! Darryl's funny.
andy I know, right?
gabe Hey, Andy?
andy Yeah?
gabe Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
andy Sure. What's going on?
gabe Are you still in love with Erin?
andy What?
gabe Because I am. I need to get her back. I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
andy No, this is horrifying.
gabe No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
andy We're just friends, okay?
gabe Do you promise that?
andy Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
gabe No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
dwight Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
jim Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
dwight You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
jim Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.
dwight Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
jim And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.
kevin One.
stanley
 $0. 50" with a camera pointed at it]
andy Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in.
dwight I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
kevin No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
creed He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
pam You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
creed No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
phyllis He means the ice pack.
erin 2
 00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or -
gabe I'm sorry. This can't wait.
erin He's just gonna call back.
gabe Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God.
erin What?
gabe Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum out. there. uh, do we not have voicemail?
erin dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
gabe Well. it's just. it messes up my rhythm.
erin I'm taking a break from dating. gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
jim Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
dwight Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
jim And the desk.
dwight The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
jim Okay.
dwight jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
jim I promise. d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so.
dwight Don't make me fire you.
jim You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
dwight Don't make me pre-fire you.
jim You wouldn't dare.
dwight Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
jim If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
dwight What?
jim If I had thought that there was a real chance that dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think, " but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
dwight How you doing, Jordan?
jordan I'm good.
dwight Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
jordan Why are you telling me this?
dwight Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh. it's a holster.
dwight Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. Ohh. Oh, what a day. What a day.
pam Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
dwight The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
andy Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
dwight The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
pam Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
dwight Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
angela Thank you.
phyllis You could put your cell phone in it instead.
dwight Uh. hello!
kevin You could put a banana in it.
dwight Why would I put a banana in my holster?
kevin In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
pam Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
dwight Okay. all right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah!
erin Andy!
andy Aah! Aah! It's so loud! . push;
oscar My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
andy Eeeeeeee. There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee. I can't find perfect C.
meredith Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
toby Hey, what happened?
kelly dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot andy in the head.
dwight No, no, no. all we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
andy Something's definitely wrong.
oscar I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
angela Oh, everybody. oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
oscar Firewall.
gabe I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
dwight Okay, why are you calling Jo?
andy I think I should go the hospital.
erin I'll go with you.
gabe No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
darryl I'll take him.
andy Thank you, Darryl.
darryl What's wrong with you?
andy It's my ear.
darryl Yeah.
andy Okay, sorry.
toby Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
gabe I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
dwight Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
dwight Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
stanley We all saw you do it.
dwight Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
erin Navy blue. Little red anchors.
dwight I have no way of knowing if that's true.
toby I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw dwight do this?
dwight Okay, really?
toby Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
ryan I felt terrorized.
dwight Come on.
toby Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
dwight I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
ryan Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
dwight Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so. so important. to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
andy Hey. We're back.
dwight There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
andy Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
dwight Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
andy Yeah.
phyllis How's your hearing?
andy Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
darryl I was talking like this. I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
kelly Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
dwight American Idol? What? No.
kelly Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
dwight No.
kelly Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
dwight Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
phyllis Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
angela Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
kevin Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
dwight I put everything back in the vending machine.
kevin Put everything back in the vending machine except. the fruit.
pam You have to get rid of all your weapons. all of them. Including killer fish.
dwight Okay.
jim Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um. you know what? I think I'm good.
dwight Thank God.
jim Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby, " at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
dwight What's jazz hands?
jim 
dwight Fine.
dwight 
kevin What the is that? Oh, my.
jo Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.
dwight Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
jo Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
jim Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
jo Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic.
dwight Well, what can you do? Life.
andy We have to clean this up now!
erin She had so much -
gabe Hey, guys.
erin Hey.
gabe Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
andy No!
gabe Hey, Andy, did you tell erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
andy Uh.
gabe I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
andy Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying.
gabe No, I was not.
andy And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is. between me and my diary.
dwight Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
kevin Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
dwight No, Kevin, come on.
kevin My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
dwight Kevin, not now.
kevin Hey, Jo!
dwight Okay, okay. Shh!
kevin No, under the jacket.
dwight You're kidding me. Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
kevin I don't feel anything.
dwight Oh, it's so wet.
kevin Push harder, Dwight.
dwight I can't. I can't push harder!
kevin Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher.
dwight Okay, how's that?
kevin Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
dwight I'm kneading it!
kevin Don't eat it.
jo Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?
dwight Jo. I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
jo What?!
dwight I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. all I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
jo Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
dwight It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
jo Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
dwight I take full responsibility.
jo Who else would be responsible?
dwight pam made me put a banana in my holster.
pam You shot a gun off -
dwight Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
jo Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
dwight Got it.
jo I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.
dwight Jo, please. I will -
jo No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.
jo You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. all righty?
gabe Yep.
jim Yep.
jo Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?
toby Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
jo Who is it?
jim Hey, Dwight. What's up?
dwight Shut up.
jim Well, you do know that jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say. in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.
angela Four, one, seven, one.
kevin Another one? darryl and
angela Yes!
angela Seven, two.
oscar Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
angela Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight.
