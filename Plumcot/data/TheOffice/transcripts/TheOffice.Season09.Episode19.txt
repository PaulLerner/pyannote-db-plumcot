stanley_hudson What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
erin_hannon Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon! Come on Stanley!
erin_hannon Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a... "Mageddon!"
erin_hannon Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
stanley_hudson I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they're making me climb Stair Mountain!
erin_hannon Come on!
oscar_martinez Our office has an unusually large number of... unusually large people.
stanley_hudson This is an abomination.
erin_hannon Come on. You got this. Here.
oscar_martinez So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
andy_bernard Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
oscar_martinez What?
andy_bernard I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There's a review of the documentary!
phyllis_vance What does it say?
andy_bernard I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, "Red Alert."
dwight_schrute Well, the alert was already set to "Red" because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to "Double Red"?
andy_bernard I think we should.
stanley_hudson
oscar_martinez "The Office An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton's own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!"
all@ Whoo!
nellie_bertram "In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There's Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get."
dwight_schrute What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news...thing.
nellie_bertram "Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy."
phyllis_vance Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that's-.
andy_bernard It's okay. The hell does he know?
nellie_bertram "A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent."
andy_bernard I want you to print that out for me.
nellie_bertram I will.
andy_bernard Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb.
erin_hannon "Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values."
nellie_bertram Oh! Which public figure?
erin_hannon I bet it's Katie Couric. I've been saying this for years.
phyllis_vance No, I think they mean more like a politician.
stanley_hudson You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
dwight_schrute Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
stanley_hudson Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
dwight_schrute The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order.
stanley_hudson You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
pete_miller Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
pam_beesly Well, we won't be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
nellie_bertram Oh, your mom's watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? Oh, um, Embassy Suites. "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
pam_beesly I wish.
nellie_bertram What, then?
pam_beesly Oh, nothing that exciting.
nellie_bertram Marriage counseling?
pam_beesly Hmm.
nellie_bertram Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
pam_beesly You know, Jim's kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
nellie_bertram Mmm.
pam_beesly I mean, we've having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right?
jim_halpert Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
toby_flenderson Oh, sure.
jim_halpert It's a little, uh, personal.
toby_flenderson Let's do it. Let's get personal.
jim_halpert I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
toby_flenderson Whoa.
jim_halpert Sorry. I—no, no, no, what I meant—what I meant actually was—
toby_flenderson Oh, yeah, no, it's okay. I can handle it. Um, so...
jim_halpert You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
toby_flenderson
jim_halpert Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple's counseling.
toby_flenderson Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren't in couple's counseling, are you? Oh, God.
jim_halpert No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couple's counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better.
toby_flenderson Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s—hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
clark My mistake.
toby_flenderson Yes, it is your mistake. He's lingering. So annoying. I'm gonna kill him. How can I help? I'm here.
jim_halpert That's all right.
andy_bernard Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye.
angela_martin Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
state_senator_rob_lipton Don't worry. I've scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.
angela_martin All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that.
dwight_schrute Andy— I need to talk to you.
andy_bernard Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up!
dwight_schrute Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
andy_bernard I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final.
dwight_schrute So what I'm hearing you say is, "Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible"?
andy_bernard Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent.
dwight_schrute Mm-hmm. Good luck.
andy_bernard Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
dwight_schrute For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts.
clark Hey, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
stanley_hudson Pass.
clark Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
dwight_schrute Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
stanley_hudson Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha—
dwight_schrute
clark Holy .
stanley_hudson No, you didn't. Sick of you and your—ooh—
dwight_schrute
stanley_hudson
dwight_schrute It's all right. Andy approved it.
meredith_palmer Man, he's really in twinkle town now.
clark Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
dwight_schrute Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do.
clark You gave him three shots.
dwight_schrute Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. Grab his feet. Let's go!
clark All right.
dwight_schrute Move it! One, two, three.
dwight_schrute He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! Oh, God. No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
clark We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
dwight_schrute Yes.
dwight_schrute Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push!
clark I am!
clark Any good weekend plans?
dwight_schrute I might see a movie.
clark Nice.
dwight_schrute What about you?
clark Uh, I don't know yet.
dwight_schrute Let's take him—
clark I was thinking about...
dwight_schrute Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
clark And then what?
dwight_schrute Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before.
clark Well, if I may, you're a natural.
dwight_schrute Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh...
clark That's a little weird.
dwight_schrute I know. Evel Knievel.
dwight_schrute
clark That's about as good as that's gonna be.
dwight_schrute Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
clark Catch?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
clark I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds.
dwight_schrute You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's only—
clark Blunt?
dwight_schrute It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicine—
clark Dude, this size of my haunches—
dwight_schrute Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
clark We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
dwight_schrute You okay?
jim_halpert So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or...
toby_flenderson You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
toby_flenderson He might start by asking each of you, "Why do you think you're here?"
pam_beesly He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that.
jim_halpert If I didn't do certain things without telling Pam, she'd be married to Roy.
pam_beesly I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up.
jim_halpert If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I—this will be so huge for our family.
toby_flenderson Well, what's a little while?
jim_halpert What do you mean?
toby_flenderson I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end.
jim_halpert That's kind of an impossible question.
erin_hannon Oh, guys, it's starting! Hurry!
kevin_malone Ooh, there's Angela! I work with her!
andy_bernard Huh, yeah. I mean, I'm happy Angela's the first one getting famous, but it's a little weird, no? I mean, she can't sing or act, so it's actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
phyllis_vance Her hair looks beautiful.
andy_bernard Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin' movie star!
erin_hannon Andy!
state_senator_rob_lipton I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest... I am gay.
all@
reporter_1 Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay?
Reporter_#2#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode19 Question for the Senator's beard.
state_senator_rob_lipton I'll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
pete_miller Poor Angela.
phyllis_vance Yeah. Poor Angela.
state_senator_rob_lipton I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn't until my marriage to Angela that I realized how...charmless I find the female body.
meredith_palmer Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
state_senator_rob_lipton There's someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
andy_bernard Come on!
state_senator_rob_lipton Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time—
erin_hannon Oscar is with the Senator too?
kevin_malone Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew!
oscar_martinez He knew!
kevin_malone Yes, we did it!
oscar_martinez You did it, Kevin.
kevin_malone Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
state_senator_rob_lipton --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing... Chief of Staff Wesley Silver.
oscar_martinez What?!
creed_bratton Wesley Silver's gay?
all@
angela_martin
kevin_malone Ohh.
creed_bratton They make a nice couple.
angela_martin
dwight_schrute Almost there. Almost there. Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside.
clark We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
dwight_schrute Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
clark That's actually really smart.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
clark God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
dwight_schrute Let's get him inside.
andy_bernard Carla Fern is not just an actor's agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
andy_bernard Actor?
darryl_philbin Oh, no. Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.
andy_bernard Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
darryl_philbin Eh, you go through a lot of mice.
darryl_philbin If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.
andy_bernard Does anything go on top of the mouse?
darryl_philbin Yeah. Little hat.
andy_bernard Aw, that's cute.
darryl_philbin Yeah.
andy_bernard What's the mouse's name?
darryl_philbin Eh, you know, it really doesn't make sense to name the mice. They're kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You're not one of those PETA guys , are you? Oh, great.
clark Hey, wait, wait, how—how are we doing this?
dwight_schrute Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
clark Just say "arms" and "legs," okay? That just—that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with.
dwight_schrute Fine, let's go.
clark
dwight_schrute Hoist his shank on three.
clark Wha—What's a shank?
dwight_schrute It's by the tenderloin.
dwight_schrute Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can you—sl-slouch him into the seat. Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt.
clark All right.
dwight_schrute Got it?
clark Yeah—yup yup.
dwight_schrute Get in the back.
clark What?
dwight_schrute Get in the back.
clark Aw, come on.
dwight_schrute Get in.
clark Damn it.
dwight_schrute Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do?
stanley_hudson Helllloooo!
clark Okay. We, hey—hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
stanley_hudson Pigeons.
dwight_schrute Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
clark Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister?
dwight_schrute New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go.
pam_beesly I'm sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
jim_halpert Well, if Pam says she won't go, then— we're gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
nellie_bertram That was exhausting.
toby_flenderson Blah blah blah blah. Jim.
nellie_bertram Well, they deserve each other, then.
toby_flenderson They do. That they do.
nellie_bertram That is for sure.
toby_flenderson That they do.
dwight_schrute And for—oh, whoopsie daisy.
wesley_silver Davis Stanley, what is going on here?
dwight_schrute He's fine. He gets carsick really easily.
clark Driving.
dwight_schrute It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
stanley_hudson Ooh-hoo, look at that baby...
dwight_schrute Stanley.
stanley_hudson Ohhh...
wesley_silver Davis That's Benji in the middle.
stanley_hudson That's Benji. Oh, he's precious. That's a healthy-looking baby.
wesley_silver Davis Very special little boy.
dwight_schrute Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child.
wesley_silver Davis Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, "eee."
dwight_schrute Like this? Watch.
stanley_hudson Eee.
all@
wesley_silver Davis Like that.
stanley_hudson A beautiful family.
dwight_schrute Right? Come on!
dwight_schrute Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
carla_fern So, what can you do?
andy_bernard Well, what can't I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn't noticed, I've got a pretty good British accent.
carla_fern Can you drive a car?
andy_bernard At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
carla_fern Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45?
andy_bernard My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal's going out on.
carla_fern Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap?
andy_bernard Yes. And yes.
carla_fern Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid's party, let ‘em throw pies at ya?
andy_bernard Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. I'm all for it.
carla_fern Well, Mr. Bernard, I'm gonna be honest with you.
andy_bernard Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
carla_fern Uh, no. We're—we're gonna take you on as a client.
andy_bernard You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
carla_fern We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out.
andy_bernard Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
todd Uh, it doesn't include headshots.
andy_bernard It doesn't include headshots.
todd No.
andy_bernard Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
stanley_hudson So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
dwight_schrute You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
stanley_hudson Oh, no, I'm not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
dwight_schrute Well—no, no—n—
stanley_hudson
dwight_schrute We need a winch and a hoist.
