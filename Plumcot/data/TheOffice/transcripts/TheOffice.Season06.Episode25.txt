toby_flenderson This here is a radon test kit. Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. This is a radon test kit. Please don't throw these out. See them all over the office.
michael_scott Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place. The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite.
michael_scott Pfffffttt.
toby_flenderson Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
michael_scott You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
toby_flenderson Please sit down.
michael_scott You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
all@ YEAH!
michael_scott Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
all@ No. No!
jim_halpert That's... not okay.
michael_scott Okay, alright.
dwight_schrute You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
michael_scott I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
dwight_schrute No, hmmm... that's still...
all@ Mm-mm.
michael_scott Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
creed_bratton Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
oscar_martinez All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
ryan_howard Is there a curtain rod in the room?
michael_scott I don't know.
stanley_hudson How about make-believe land has anything you want?
jim_halpert Stanley, please, this is serious!
angela_martin Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
michael_scott Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
dwight_schrute Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
toby_flenderson I don't wanna do this.
michael_scott Toby, just do it! God!
dwight_schrute Toby, come on.
dwight_schrute Ready, one bullet. And boom!
all@ Yeah, that works. That works!
michael_scott Good work.
pam_beesly What flavors did you get?
erin_hannon It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
pam_beesly Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
erin_hannon Do you want me to go back to the store?
pam_beesly No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
erin_hannon This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
pam_beesly Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
erin_hannon After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
pam_beesly Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
erin_hannon That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
erin_hannon We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
pam_beesly And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
erin_hannon He's coming.
pam_beesly Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
toby_flenderson Hey everyone.
pam_beesly No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
dwight_schrute Leave, get outta here.
pam_beesly Leave!
dwight_schrute Right now!
pam_beesly Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
michael_scott Morning everyone.
all@ Hey! Hey, hey!
erin_hannon Hi Michael.
michael_scott Hello!
dwight_schrute Michael, nice tie or something.
michael_scott Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think.
kevin_malone That's hilarious.
pam_beesly That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
michael_scott Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
kevin_malone Boi-oi-oi-ing
michael_scott Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
mr_barr I don't follow this exactly. Uh, "The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have..."
dwight_schrute and Angela Joint custody
mr_barr Are we talking about your grandchildren?
angela_martin No.
dwight_schrute No.
angela_martin Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
dwight_schrute Alleged contract.
angela_martin Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
dwight_schrute Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
dwight_schrute So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse?
angela_martin I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
dwight_schrute How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
angela_martin Dwight, look at my teeth.
dwight_schrute Eughh.
andy_bernard No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
pam_beesly Could he still be seeing her?
phyllis_vance I don't think he'd do that.
jim_halpert So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
andy_bernard Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
jim_halpert Exactly. It happened in Big.
michael_scott No, I gotta go. Text me later.
jim_halpert I'm really too tired to do this.
pam_beesly Me too!
jim_halpert Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
pam_beesly Hey Michael.
michael_scott Hey.
pam_beesly We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
jim_halpert We can order in from Hooters.
michael_scott Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
pam_beesly We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
jim_halpert Billy Joel Rock Band.
michael_scott That... exists?
pam_beesly Yes.
michael_scott Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
pam_beesly Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
michael_scott Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
phyllis_vance Oh Michael.
michael_scott Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
michael_scott I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
meredith_palmer That is something I would never do.
michael_scott Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
meredith_palmer Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
meredith_palmer I ask... everyone in the room, "Are you in a relationship?".
michael_scott People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
kelly_kapoor Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
ryan_howard Okay.
michael_scott I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
andy_bernard How does he feel about it?
michael_scott He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
jim_halpert Now you're just being hurtful.
michael_scott I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
phyllis_vance Hey!
michael_scott On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
andy_bernard Did Donna tell you that?
michael_scott Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
andy_bernard So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
michael_scott You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
andy_bernard My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
andy_bernard So... here's the thing about infidelity.
michael_scott Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
andy_bernard How does that work?
michael_scott Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
andy_bernard In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
michael_scott I am Beyonce always.
andy_bernard Not this time.
michael_scott Yes, I am.
andy_bernard This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
michael_scott I would love that.
andy_bernard Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
michael_scott I have work to do.
andy_bernard Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
michael_scott Let's go. I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
andy_bernard Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
michael_scott All right, Andy, please.
andy_bernard Baseball!
michael_scott Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
andy_bernard Where?
michael_scott Right there. The coach!
andy_bernard Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
michael_scott Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
andy_bernard And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
michael_scott All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
andy_bernard Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
gabe_lewis Guys?
jim_halpert Pam.
pam_beesly Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
gabe_lewis Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
pam_beesly You were supposed to be the Lookout.
jim_halpert Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
gabe_lewis I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
jim_halpert Sorry about that.
pam_beesly So embarrassing.
gabe_lewis Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
jim_halpert Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
pam_beesly We will be well-rested tomorrow.
gabe_lewis Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
jim_halpert Excellent. Go for it.
gabe_lewis I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
jim_halpert Right? So, uh, let's uh...
mr_barr Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.
angela_martin Same page. Go to the next one.
dwight_schrute Same page. Just keep moving.
mr_barr Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--
dwight_schrute Which we can't know.
mr_barr This is essentially...
dwight_schrute Unless we're unplugged.
mr_barr Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
dwight_schrute And wake up in the future.
mr_barr Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
dwight_schrute What?
mr_barr Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.
angela_martin What?
mr_barr So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.
dwight_schrute What?
dwight_schrute I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
andy_bernard Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
michael_scott You have no idea what you're talking about.
andy_bernard I know it's like cricket.
michael_scott You don't. No, no.
andy_bernard And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
michael_scott You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit."
andy_bernard Seems pretty well liked by the team.
michael_scott Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
andy_bernard You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
michael_scott I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
dwight_schrute $30,000? There's gotta be another way.
angela_martin He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
dwight_schrute Look, I will not pay.
angela_martin Well, I have an alternative.
dwight_schrute "Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"
mr_barr Look, I don't think that's actually legal.
dwight_schrute Agreed.
dwight_schrute Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
dwight_schrute But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
angela_martin Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
dwight_schrute Fine. Five times.
mr_barr Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.
angela_martin I want eye contact.
dwight_schrute No.
angela_martin Yes.
dwight_schrute Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
angela_martin I'm not some farm animal.
andy_bernard Great game, coach.
michael_scott Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
andy_bernard You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
shane Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys.
andy_bernard Ha. The other guys can go die.
michael_scott Okay.
andy_bernard Baseball! Go talk to him.
michael_scott No. God. You go talk to him.
shane Let's go.
andy_bernard Shane. Great game man!
shane Do I know you?
andy_bernard No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
shane Are you somebody's... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kenny's dads?
andy_bernard Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball.
shane Okay.
andy_bernard But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
shane Okay. Let's go!
andy_bernard Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
shane Whoa!
andy_bernard I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
shane Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to... focus here on the game.
andy_bernard I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
shane Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this.
andy_bernard Of course.
shane All right.
andy_bernard But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
michael_scott No, no, no.
andy_bernard Come on, get over here.
michael_scott I'm good. Oh, my God.
andy_bernard Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
michael_scott Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
shane It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going.
michael_scott Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
michael_scott Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
erin_hannon Thanks, Michael.
michael_scott Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
oscar_martinez Why would you throw something wet at me?
michael_scott You love it. There ya go.
jim_halpert Now, were those for the team?
michael_scott Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
jim_halpert Ah.
pam_beesly I don't think those were yours to take.
michael_scott Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
andy_bernard I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
pam_beesly Did you talk to him?
michael_scott I did.
pam_beesly You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
kevin_malone Wow. That is crazy.
phyllis_vance Was there a fistfight?
michael_scott No. We just talked. He's very nice.
phyllis_vance And it didn't change your mind.
michael_scott It did not.
phyllis_vance Michael, that's awful.
michael_scott Isn't it?
phyllis_vance Yes.
michael_scott I'm awful, aren't I?
kevin_malone Yeah. That's pretty bad.
michael_scott I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
oscar_martinez How can you live with yourself?
michael_scott I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
kevin_malone That is a dangerous game, friendo.
kelly_kapoor Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
ryan_howard I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
kelly_kapoor 'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
ryan_howard All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, "I read a book about anthropology."
kelly_kapoor I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
ryan_howard I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
kelly_kapoor That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
michael_scott I don't care. I have an appetite for life! Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
ryan_howard Good for you, man. Good for you.
ryan_howard He takes what he wants.
ryan_howard You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
erin_hannon What about Kelly?
ryan_howard You read my mind.
erin_hannon Is this a joke?
ryan_howard Yep.
ryan_howard It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
michael_scott You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
dwight_schrute I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. Let's see what she gets. Aah!
creed_bratton Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
michael_scott Yeah, I noticed that.
creed_bratton Are you gonna add any more?
michael_scott Nope.
creed_bratton He don't give an "F" about nothin'!
michael_scott I have got big balls.
pam_beesly I don't think I'm gonna make it.
jim_halpert What about an energy drink or something?
pam_beesly It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
jim_halpert Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
pam_beesly Well, it does and it doesn't.
darryl_philbin Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
jim_halpert A place?
darryl_philbin A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
pam_beesly You sleep in the warehouse?
darryl_philbin Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
jim_halpert Okay.
darryl_philbin Pam.
pam_beesly Okay.
phyllis_vance For your signature.
michael_scott Okay. Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. Phyllis, look at-- okay, that's... All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
kevin_malone Why not your condo?
michael_scott Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
stanley_hudson Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
michael_scott Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
andy_bernard Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
michael_scott Nobody better try to stop me. Good.
dwight_schrute I could have stopped him.
dwight_schrute Are you warmed up?
angela_martin No.
dwight_schrute God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?
angela_martin What did you do to yourself?
dwight_schrute Never mind. Just never mind.
angela_martin Well, it better work.
dwight_schrute Oh, it'll work. Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
michael_scott How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. Like a grownup. That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
onair_reporter Michael Scott?
michael_scott Yes?
onair_reporter Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
michael_scott Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
onair_reporter I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
michael_scott Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
