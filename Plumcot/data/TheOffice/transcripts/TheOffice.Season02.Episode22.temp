michael Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just. It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, "Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening. " Makes you feel good.
jim Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
dwight I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
pam It's a nice tux.
dwight I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
roy So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
pam Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
dwight Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
jim I can always kind of win at roulette.
dwight Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
jim Yeah.
dwight How would you do that?
jim Mind control.
dwight You can't be serious. Are you serious?
jim Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
dwight I don't believe you. Continue.
jim It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
dwight That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh. Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
jim Okay, I'll try.
dwight Oh, my God.
michael I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
jan Yeah, but. Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
michael Top 80 percent!
jan Michael?
michael Yeah?
jan You know that I'm very serious here.
michael Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
jan What?
michael Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
jan I thought that you were their fearless leader.
michael I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
jan I think you can handle it.
michael Oh, come on. Come on.
jan I think so, Michael.
michael You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
jan Goodbye, Michael.
michael jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
michael Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
oscar Again? We do that every year.
michael Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
oscar It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
michael Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of vance Refrigeration.
dwight Yes!
michael So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
jim That doesn't exist anymore.
michael Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
pam No, they stopped making that show.
michael Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
angela You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
creed There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
kevin Something with animals. Or people.
kelly Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is so hot. And he gave his wife the biggest diamond ring. I know he didn't do it. . Maybe he did it.
angela We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity?
michael Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna.
toby Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's. You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night. And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
michael Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not. that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
jim I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
michael No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
phyllis Afghani.
michael What?
phyllis Afghani.
michael That's a dog.
pam No, that's Afghan.
michael That's a shawl.
dwight Wait, canine AIDS?
michael No. Humans with AIDS.
creed Who has AIDS?
jim Guys, the Afghanistananies.
michael Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
michael There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. "I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head. " And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
jim What are you doing?
pam Oh, nothing.
jim "Till Death Do Us Rock. "
pam They're wedding bands.
jim Oh.
pam roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
jim Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
pam There's a KISS cover band in here.
jim Let's do it.
pam I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
jim Why did I talk to jan about transferring? Well, you know. I have no future here.
michael I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
darryl Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
michael It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
darryl Except my warehouse.
michael Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
dwight Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
michael Why are you here?
dwight When darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
michael Not. I said, not that.
darryl We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
michael That's ironic.
darryl What?
michael That you are afraid.
darryl Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
michael Dinkin' flicka.
darryl Dinkin' flicka.
darryl I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, "Fleece it out. " "Going mach five. " "Dinkin' flicka. " You know, things us Negroes say.
michael Give me some.
darryl Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
jim Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
pam I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
jim Yes.
pam Have three stages, yeah.
jim Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
pam Oh.
jim Let's take a look. Nice.
pam Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.
jim What?
pam On the drums! On the drums!
jim Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
kevin We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
jim Wow. Oh!
pam Oh, my.
jim Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna.
pam No! No!
jim No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
pam No, come back! No, no, no!
jim Kev!
pam jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
michael Yes
pam Michael, carol Stills for you.
michael Who?
pam carol Stills.
michael Do I know a carol Stills?
pam Your realtor.
michael Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good?
pam It's still me.
pam Sometimes I don't put michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
pam Carol, you're on with Michael.
carol Hello, Michael?
michael Hi, Carol. How you doing?
carol I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
michael Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.

michael Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
carol Drink would be good.
michael Okay.
creed Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things. Billy's

billy No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart. Billy's
girlfriend Okay.

stanley Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?

dealer Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.
