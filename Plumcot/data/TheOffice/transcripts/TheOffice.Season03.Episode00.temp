jan Okay. So what is it that you wanted to talk to me about?
oscar Well, we've been trying to balance the books for a week now, and for some reason, they're not balancing.
jan I'm sorry?
angela There's about $3, 000 missing, and we're trying to figure out where it went.
jan Well, it's probably just some accounting error.
angela It is not an accounting error.
jan Well, it could be.
angela It is not an accounting error. Well, it's not my accounting error.
kevin This is the first I've heard of it. They never tell me anything. I like it that way.
jan Obviously we do need to find it quickly to ensure that it's not a criminal action.
kevin Absolutely, Jan.
jan But. I guess that's it. So, call me when you have news. Okay?
oscar Okay.
angela Michael said to stop by on your way out.
oscar I'm pretty sure Michael's involved because every other time there's been money missing from the office, it's always been Michael. Except, he's usually really obvious. Like, he'll say he spent $50 on a lunch with a client, and he'll submit a receipt from J. Crew.
angela Are we absolutely sure it's not an accounting error?
oscar I went over my books three times.
angela Me, too.
kevin Has anyone in the office bought anything nice recently?
angela That's a very nice watch, Oscar.
oscar Yes, it is. My grandfather left it to me when he died.
angela I've never seen it before. He must have died very recently.
oscar Yes, he did, actually. About three weeks ago.
phyllis You guys wanted to see me?
kevin Yeah.
oscar Hi, Phyllis. Um, we're going over everyone's expenses for the year. It's just standard procedure.
angela We're missing $3, 000 and we're trying to figure out where it went. Michael is the obvious suspect, but he is the boss, so we have to at least pretend to ask other people first.
oscar So, I know the answer's probably "no, " but did you take any money, or buy anything with company money or anything like that?
kevin Oh, my God.
angela I knew it.
oscar You did?
phyllis Well, about three months ago, I was on a sales call and I broke the heel on my shoe and I only had the corporate card. I'm really sorry.
oscar Well, how much was that?
phyllis $14.
oscar We're talking more like $3, 000.
phyllis $3, 000? That wasn't me.
oscar No. We didn't think it was.
phyllis It will never happen again. My boyfriend, Bob Vance, from Vance Refrigeration gave me a Vance Refrigeration credit card. Only for emergencies.
kevin An emergency like, you have an ice cream cake, and you're in the sun, and it's melting?
angela You don't use it to buy refrigerators, Kevin!
kevin Don't yell at me.
oscar Okay. Thank you, Phyllis.
phyllis Okay.
angela So, is there anything you want to tell us about? Accounting-wise?
meredith Gosh, I don't think so.
oscar We're trying to find out who stole money from the company.
angela It's better to be embarrassed by the truth now, then to go to jail for it later.
kevin Why don't we just ask her if she took the $3, 000?
angela Idiot. Now we don't have the element of surprise. It's impossible to trap her, and we won't be able to register the look on her face when we ask her if she stole $3, 000.
meredith You think I stole $3, 000?
angela Oh, we know you did. or someone else did.
oscar Did you use any company money for anything? We're just trying to balance the books.
meredith Please. If I stole $3, 000, I wouldn't be here. I'd be on a beach in Jamaica drinking Red Stripe.
kevin Oh, I love Red Stripe.
oscar I do, too. That's Jamaican beer?
meredith Yeah. We should go out and get a beer after work. Or, hey, you want to go right now?
oscar It's 11
 15.
meredith Yeah. So, that's too early?
angela You didn't take any money at all? You're sure?
meredith Yes. I'm a single mom. I would never do anything to jeopardize my kid.
oscar I thought you had two kids.
meredith My ex-husband took Wendy, the good one.
oscar Okay. Thanks for your time.
meredith Sure.
kevin Thanks, Meredith.
meredith You guys want to get that beer?
stanley Somebody stole some money. That is fantastic. How much did they get?
kevin $3, 000.
kevin We're in the process of interviewing everyone in the office. I think it's kind of fun. It's a great chance to catch up with people.
oscar I'm sure it's not you, but we have to ask.
stanley I hope they bought something nice, and I hope you never catch them.
angela We'd appreciate your cooperation if you find out who did it.
stanley I'll tell you what, if I find out who did it, I will shake their hand, pat them on the back, give them 72 hours to get out of the country, and then I'll let you know who it is. Is there anything else?
oscar No. Okay. Thanks for your help.
stanley Thank you.
kevin I don't think it was him.
angela Really, genius?
kevin angela thinks it's an insult when she calls me a genius, all sarcastic and whatnot, but technically, guess what? I am a genius. When I was a kid, I took an IQ test and I scored over 100. So, joke is on you, Angela.
angela All right. Who should we ask next?
kevin I don't know.
oscar You know, my mom picks the worst times to visit.
kevin Why? What's going on?
oscar Well, my mom's in town, but a bunch of my friends are in town, too, and we were going to go watch The Prince of Tides.
kevin Why?
oscar Well, we don't like it. We make fun of it. It's like a Rocky Horror Picture thing we do.
kevin All right.
oscar But, my mom's in town, so I can't go.
angela Can we focus, please?
kevin I've never seen it.
oscar Kevin, it's really bad.
oscar I really don't think it was anyone in the office.
angela It had to have been someone.
angela Yeah, I do think it's someone in this office, which really breaks my heart, to tell you the truth. Because I thought we were all good people here.
oscar Maybe it was someone in the warehouse.
kevin Who?
oscar Maybe it was Roy. He's getting married. He can use the money.
angela roy wouldn't do it.
kevin How do you know?
angela He wouldn't do it. He has too much character.
kevin You have a crush on Roy.
angela I do not. That is inaprobable. inappropriate.
kevin You have a crush on Roy. Unbelievable.
angela Stop it! Stop it right now!
kevin Does he excite you? Does he get your blood flowing?
angela Kevin.
kevin Does he get your.
angela Kevin, you guys don't know anything.
kevin roy and angela sitting in a tree K-I-S
angela Kevin, cut it out!
oscar We don't think it was you.
kevin No.
oscar But we have to ask everybody if you used any money to buy anything and forgot to report it, or.
roy Well, I mean, how would I do that even if I wanted to?
kevin You would have to take some from petty cash.
roy Well, I don't even know where that is.
kevin In Oscar's drawer.
roy Isn't it locked?
kevin Well, he keeps the key behind his computer.
oscar Kevin, why are you giving him instructions on how to steal?
roy Wait, hold on. I'd never do something like that. It's wrong. I don't steal things.
angela Well, I'm satisfied. So, thank you very much for your time, Roy.
kevin Oh, Roy, one more question. What do you think of Angela?
oscar You don't have to answer that one.
kevin But you can if you want to.
oscar But you don't have to. . push;
oscar So, it isn't Phyllis, it isn't stanley or Jim, it isn't Meredith, it isn't any of us.
angela We don't know that.
kevin Oh, come on.
kevin I didn't steal $3, 000 from petty cash. I am not stupid. If I wanted to steal from this company, there are a lot of easier ways to do it. For example, I could seal people's coats and sell them on eBay.
angela It obviously isn't dwight because he has the most integrity of anyone in the office. What? Did you talk to Kelly?
oscar Yes. She said she didn't do it, then 45 minutes later the conversation ended.
kevin I talked to Creed, and he said he didn't do it. And then he tried to sell me dietary supplements.
oscar Okay, enough of this investigation stuff. We just have to put a memo to the office and ask that someone come forward anonymously.
angela Fine. I'll write it.
kevin No, I wanna write it.
angela No.
kevin No. Angela, you never let me write accounting memos.
angela Fine. I'll supervise.
kevin Yeah. God.
angela The date should be right-justified. Right-justified, not left-justified. Do you know what "justified" means?
kevin Yeah, as in "justifiable homicide. "
angela "To whom it may concern?" Really, Kevin? Really?
kevin Fine, then you write it.
angela Thank you, it's just easier this way.
kevin I finished my own memo. angela stinks. I mean, I'm not handing it out or anything. And don't tell her I said it. It's just for me. In fact, forget that I said anything about it, ever. Oh, God. What have I done?
angela We are missing $3, 000. Things are getting tense.
oscar Wait. Here, I found it! Here it is! $2, 800 returned to petty cash. Angela, I forgot to sign in the money.
angela Okay. Yeah.
oscar It's got to be it.
kevin Oops. Um, I took that and then I briefly lost it, but then the Pistons beat the Cavs, and so now I'm returning it all back. Go Pistons. But this is completely unrelated to the other $3, 000.
angela You gambled petty cash?
kevin Yeah, but I won, didn't I?
angela That's not the point. How are we supposed to believe you didn't take the other $3, 000?
kevin 'Cause I'm telling you that I didn't.
oscar You have to admit, man, this looks a little suspicious.
kevin Oh, suspicious. Well, how come angela suddenly has a new necklace, all of a sudden?
angela My friend gave it to me.
oscar What friend?
angela Diane. Chester. Snydburgh.
oscar What? That's not even close to being a real person.
angela Well, it's none of your business who gave it to me. But, I didn't steal any money.
kevin You guys, this is stupid, that we're turning on each other. That is exactly what they want us to do.
oscar Who?
kevin The guys who stole the money.
angela All right, you know, there's only one more thing to do. We have to investigate Michael.
kevin He is still in there.
angela Yeah, we know.
oscar Basically, we're convinced that Michael took the missing $3, 000, so we're waiting until he leaves his office so we can go in and search for evidence. When I say it out loud, it really doesn't seem like a good idea.
oscar He said he was leaving right at 5
 00.
kevin What time is it now?
angela You don't have a watch?
kevin It's slow.
angela You can't look at the clock up there?
kevin Well, you can't just tell me what time it is?
angela I think people should be self-sufficient.
kevin I think you're mean.
oscar Okay, guys, let's just wait for him to leave.
kevin What are you doing tonight? Wanna get a beer?
oscar I can't. I have errands to run.
kevin What are you doing?
oscar I'm going to the mall. I need a new wok. Just stuff like that.
kevin What happened to your old wok?
oscar Nothing. Nothing. I just want a new wok, there's a new one.
angela You know, I'm not mean. I'm just demanding. I'm sorry if I was mean.
kevin It's okay.
angela Thank you.
oscar That was uncomfortable.
oscar Angela, Angela.
kevin Shh, shh.
angela Okay, let's go.
kevin This is so much fun.
angela It's not supposed to be fun. . Again, sorry.
kevin Get it?
oscar What is it?
kevin Animal House. You guys are breaking my spirit.
kevin Attention! There is a lot of junk in here! Over!
angela Don't touch anything. You'll leave fingerprints.
oscar You think he's gonna dust for fingerprints?
angela Stop that.
kevin Awesome.
oscar What are we even looking for?
angela Receipts maybe. Any evidence he took the money. Or something worth $3, 000.
kevin Do you think this thing is worth $3, 000? It's cool.
oscar Check this out. "Michael Scott is the proud owner of a quality Seyko timepiece. " You think he paid $3, 000 for a knock-off of a $40 watch?
angela I'm gonna go on his computer.
kevin Okay, this drawer is locked. Oscar, do you have a key?
oscar No, Kevin, I don't. If I were Michael, where would I hide a key to that drawer? In this drawer. One, two, three, six, nine. Count them. Nine snow globes with Dunder Mifflin logos on them and nothing else.
kevin He has a snow-globe drawer.
oscar And he keeps it locked.
kevin I'd lock it, too. That is very embarrassing.
angela Put it back, Kevin. It's not yours.
kevin I like it.
oscar Okay, just go to Quicken, 'cause I setup online checking for him.
angela Okay, here we go. Last transaction was $23 to Jack's Joke and Magic Shop.
kevin No.
oscar Go to the beginning of the month.
angela Last eight transactions are to Jack's Joke and Magic Shop.
kevin But what are you doing?
angela Paying his electric bill.
kevin I do not think you should do that.
angela Well, it's about to be shut off.
oscar Okay. This is pointless. Someone just has to talk to him. kevin and
oscar Not it.
angela Hey, wait. Not it.
dwight You're saying Michael stole money from his own company?
angela Well, we've asked everyone else.
dwight No! No, that's insane. It has to be somebody else. Like Meredith. Or Creed. No. Meredith, definitely.
angela We asked her. She said she didn't do it.
dwight Which is exactly what you'd say if you did do it. Oh, man! I should've been handling this investigation from the beginning.
angela I believe she didn't do it. Are you doubting me?
dwight No.
kevin And here.
oscar Oh, my God.
dwight There has to be a better explanation.
angela How did he afford that new waterbed he's always bragging about?
dwight He charged it. Discover. Made a little cash back on the deal. Smart. If he were a general in the Army, and you accused him without proof, you would be court-martialed in front of a firing squad.
angela That's not true.
dwight Okay, watch "A Few Good Men" and tell me that that's not true. I own it on DVD if you wanna come by later. "You can't handle the truth. " Just kidding, you can.
angela Well, dwight says that Michael didn't take it, but frankly, I think he's hiding something. What?
oscar We, uh. We found it.
angela You did? Where?
oscar In your books.
angela Excuse me?
oscar You accidentally logged this equipment depreciation twice.
angela Well, that doesn't sound like me.
oscar Did you let someone else have access to your books?
angela Absolutely not.
oscar Then.
angela Oh.
kevin Yeah. Oh.
angela Very well. Case closed.
oscar Very well. Very well.
kevin Very well.
oscar Very well.
kevin This is the best day of my life.
