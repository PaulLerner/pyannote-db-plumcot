andy Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.
andy Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?
stanley Holiday wishes.
andy What's that, Stanley?
stanley We know exactly what holiday you're referring to.
andy It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.
stanley I've been here eighteen years and have suffered through some weird thematic Christmases. A Honolulu Christmas, A Pulp Fiction Christmas, A Muslim Christmas, Moroccan Christmas. Mo-rocca Christmas. I don't want it. Christmas is Christmas is Christmas is Christmas.
jim I got stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. . Might not have been the best idea.
stanley I don't want no Kwanza wreath, I don't need a dreidel in my face, that's it's own thing. And who's that black Santa for?! I don't care! I know Santa ain't black! I could care less. I want Christmas! Just give me plain baby Jesus, lying in a manger, Christmas!
meredith What is the status on my wish?
andy Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.
dwight What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
andy That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.
dwight Where? Dark side or light side?
andy Light side.
dwight Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
andy As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent. . beachfront.
dwight Thank you, Andy.
andy So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica. . C'mon guys, Jessica?. Jim, tell 'em who jessica is.
jim She's not your grandmother, is she?
andy Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?
jim Yeah.
andy jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.
creed That's great. When you know you know. Hey, what's Ruth's deal, man?
andy Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.
erin I love Jessica, and I haven't even met her yet. It's like we don't even need to meet, you know? I already love you. Stay home.
kelly I just want you to know that I will be mean to jessica if you want me to be.
erin Oh no, no. It's fine, Kelly.
kelly It's really no problem. I was already planning on being mean to her.
erin That's OK, I don't want you to do that.
robert Hello, ah. Merry Christmas, Erin. Kelly, Happy Pancha Ganapati.
kelly Eww, what is that?
robert The five day Hindu celebration in December honoring the god Ganesh, Patron of the Arts.
kelly Cool.
kevin Hey, man.
robert Hey! Oh!
kevin How ya holdin' up. because of your wife leaving you?
oscar Kevin?
robert I actually appreciate the human intimacy. Feel like a kitten being cradled by a gorilla.
kevin Yeah.
robert It's been ten days since I had sexual intercourse.
andy Well you came to the right place. . Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.
robert I hope so. The corporate party was wretched. I am so tired of the Black Eyed Peas. It's rock-n-roll for people who don't like rock-n-roll. It's rap for people who don't like rap. It's pop for people who don't like pop. . ah, heartbreaking.
andy Oh, thank you.
andy Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.
dwight Fine with me. jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
jim It wasn't me.
andy It wasn't either of you.
jim Kathy wants to leave our clump?
andy Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important. but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.
dwight I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.
jim Ow, What are you doing?
andy Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!
jim Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
andy Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand. . Mo-nay.
jim What was that?
dwight What is it?
andy Money. . You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.
jim Can't do that.
dwight No, absolutely not.
andy You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.
jessica Hi. I'm Jessica. I'm looking for Andy?
erin Jessica. Yes. We don't say hi, we hug. I'm Erin.
jessica Oh! Oof!
erin Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
jessica Oh.
andy My ex is meeting my s*x. . which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your pen1s. that's just part of it.
andy Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my pen1s. Hi.
jessica Hi.
andy Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.
erin Wow.
andy Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.
jessica Oh, that's great. Backbone of the office.
erin Which is funny, actually, because my spine is a mess.
andy What?
jessica Oh.
erin Scoliosis. Had to wear a back brace for three years but I never did.
andy Oh no.
jessica Ah.
andy Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.
jessica Spontaneous scoliosis.
erin Oh.
darryl This thing could take your arm off, your head off, you know, just exercise caution.
val Thank you.
darryl Alright.
val Alright.
darryl Oh yeah, and um there's a Christmas party upstairs tonight, wanted to tell you about.
val Isn't that just for popsicles?
darryl Popsicles?
val Yeah, upstairs people? Cause you got a stick up your butt?
nate Ah! See, I, I, I thought it was because they're so rich they could all eat popsicles all the time. I, in my, I.
darryl Well you should definitely come. The foreman always comes. Plus it's fun, you know cookies, smoked fish, alcohol, people acting stupid.
nate You had me at "clookies. " I can't wait to find out what they are.
val What should I wear?
darryl Oh, it's nice, it's real nice. People get dressed up.
nate I will look so handsome for you, Darryl.
jim Ah. I'm gonna s-
jim dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing. . I get really pranky when I drink.
robert Erin, what can I get for you?
erin Uh, do you have cola? Kirkland if you have it.
robert Now why would you come to a bar and ask for a cola when you can get some from the kitchen? Did some small part of you want something a little stronger? Ryan, Kevin, Phyllis, Oscar, come and take these shots!
ryan Yes!
oscar Yes!
ryan Will do.
robert The fifth one is for you, Erin. You could take it or leave it. To take it would be to accept that you're at a party and you're an adult woman, with an adventurous spirit. To leave it would be fine too.
phyllis One, two three!
kevin Yes.
erin OK.
robert Mmm. Wow.
erin Whoo! Jiminy Christmas!
robert Jiminey Christmas indeed.
erin Hit 'er up.
robert Oh.
kevin Oh yes.
ryan Whoo!
erin Yeah!
oscar Wow.
jim Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card. you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.
jim So dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife. from me.
dwight Boom!
ryan But look, it's Christmas, so you're allowed. whoa, hello. Um, you're allowed to do.
kevin Good cookie.
darryl I meant dressed up compared to normal. You usually dress like a ghost-buster.
val OK.
darryl I thought you'd wear a sweater.
val Since when does a sweater mean "dressed up"? Am I your grandson?
darryl Come on, stay, alright? It's good for people to get to know you.
val As a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, maybe.
erin I want. my sugar free cookie, and then I want a sugar cookie. and then I want my nap!
stanley That's right.
erin Whoo! Thank you.
robert She, she is remarkable.
andy Edgy impressions.
erin Thank you.
andy How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.
erin A thousand.
andy Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.
erin Maybe you should mind your own business. Just kidding!
dwight Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
toby Oh my god.
dwight Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
jim I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
dwight Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
jim Hmm.
toby You know this sounds a lot like the premise of my latest Chad Flendermen novel. A murder for framing.
toby Chad Flendermen. Just an easy going black guy, he knows the streets, yet he also went to Oxford. So. Just as comfortable on a motorcycle as he is on Air Force One. Oh and he's also the world's leading Egyptologist. . push;
angela Toby! Nobody cares about your sex-crazed black detective.
toby No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
dwight Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
jim Nice try, this is ridiculous.
dwight Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
jim Three times.
dwight You see?
andy Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.
jim Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
toby Fingerprints can be planted. You know with a severed hand.
kelly Do you think that's what happened? Do you think he used a severed hand?
jim OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control.
dwight Might wanna run that by angela cause it's so cute.
angela No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
jim Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
dwight Come down right away!
jim Uh, I don't know, let me ask. Uh, were you quilled?
dwight Yes, I was quilled.
jim And what's it's name?
dwight Henrietta.
jim Oops.
andy What? . Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.
erin Hey, guys. I just wanted to say. Come here! I'm so happy you guys are together. OK? And you both have such beautiful hair.
jessica Thank you.
erin I hope you guys get married. . and who knows? Maybe at the wedding, I meet someone.
andy OK!
erin And later on tonight, I hope I see you guys kiss. Ah! OK, well I'm gonna go do another reverse spit. That's how the cool kids say "get a drink".
jessica That's uh, that's the girl you dated.
andy Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um.
jessica No, she, she seems fine.
andy Yeah, uh, excuse me.
jessica OK.
andy Yep. Hey!
erin Hey.
andy Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?
erin Every martini has an olive.
andy OK. maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.
kevin I don't wanna put you out, but if someone's making oatmeal, I'll take a apple cinnamon and a maple brown sugar in one bowl with whole milk.
erin Hey, I never told you my Christmas wish.
andy Ah, OK.
erin It's about you.
andy That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.
erin It's that I wish jessica was dead.
andy You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.
erin I wish she was in a graveyard! Under the ground. with worms coming out of her mouth.
andy Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.
erin Too late! It's already been wished! And you promised it would come true. You wrote it in an email! So, which one are you? A murderer or a liar?
kevin Hey.
erin Hey.
kevin So, there was talk of oatmeal.
phyllis You know, don't listen to what anyone is saying. You look like a, a princess.
val Yeah. Thanks.
andy I swear.
jessica Did you not.
andy I was too embarrassed!
jim Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
phyllis Is that Cici?
jim Yes. It is.
andy Um.
phyllis That's awful.
andy Cici is Jim's daughter.
jessica Oh my god. How could somebody do that?
jim I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
oscar Who did this? Who did this? Do you know who did this?
jim I don't-
andy I know who did this. . Dwight.
phyllis Dwight?
jim Yeah.
andy Dwight.
oscar No!
phyllis He should pay.
andy Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.
jim O. K.
andy It's, I mean.
jim Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like.
oscar That's no accident.
jim Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it. by accident.
phyllis What?
oscar What?
jim I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it. . Merry merry.
dwight Enough of this garbage. This is Christmas. Hi-yah!!!!! Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
jim You alright, Santa?
andy You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?
jim Yes.
andy Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?
jim Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
andy No. I don't, hmm, I don't know.
jim OK.
andy By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.
jim Alright. I will definitely do that.
andy Alright, I'll tell Dwight.
jim You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
andy Christmas miracles do happen.
jim Yes. They totally do.
ryan You can't click on these Kardashian links, that's why you have so many viruses.
kelly Well help me, OK? Just, uh take.
ryan I'm trying but you need to-
erin Hey.
kelly Yo.
erin Game on.
kelly On it.
jessica I don't know what I was thinking, it was awful.
kelly Jessica, did you just fart?
kelly And that, is how it's done.
erin I would like another alcohol.
robert Let's you and I take a walk. Oscar, you're in charge of the bar.
oscar What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler. does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
robert Your heart is broken. So is mine.
erin And.
robert And what?
erin And you have any advice or anything?
robert No my god.
erin . Help me feel better.
robert I've been married thrice and each has ended in an acrimonious divorce, I'm not sure I'm the best person to give love advice. . I was hoping you were gonna make me feel better.
nate When you do your makeup,
jessica Uh huh.
nate How long you, does it take usually? Cause.
jessica Um, it ta-, um it depends.
toby . . Chad Flendermen's kryptonite.
creed Whoa. We got a real Clarence Thomas here.
darryl Hi.
jessica I'll see you at home?
