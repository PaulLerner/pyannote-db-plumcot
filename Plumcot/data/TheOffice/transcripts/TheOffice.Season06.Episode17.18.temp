pam I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave. Yeah, I'm pregnant. Great, well, I'll write up the order. Okay, thanks.
dwight Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
jim Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby? Oh, thank you very much. I'm excited. Oh, definitely.
dwight No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!
pam There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life. People like it.
dwight Hey there. dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? . Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.
dwight I need a baby. I'll never outsell jim and pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
pam Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
kevin I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook. Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
pam Hmm.
kevin Pregnant pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot. Not all meals. Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
kevin I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.
pam Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?
kevin I think it should be a surprise.
meredith Oh, getting there, huh?
pam No, no. I still have time.
pam I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart. So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
jim Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
pam If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
jim Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it. And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
pam I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
pam Ooh.
michael Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car.
jim Michael.
michael Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
jim Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
michael Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
pam You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
michael Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
jim Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.
michael Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!
pam Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital. We are waiting until midnight.
erin Ooh, spooky. But why?
jim Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
pam Everything's fine. We have plenty of time.
nick Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.
michael Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I. T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
angela What are you looking at?
dwight Ha, nerd.
kelly Did you know that labor can last weeks? Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
dwight Bare my child.
angela Excuse me?
dwight I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything. Very well. Let's meet at 4
 00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
jim That's seven minutes. Here we go. This is happening. Come on.
pam Hold on, hold on. It isn't midnight yet.
jim Are you serious? Pam.
pam No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
jim I. Pam, please.
pam I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
andy Yeah, no, you really should. Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks. My old roommate.
pam Did you hear that? Butt-mud Brooks.
jim Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
pam Five minutes apart.
jim So, the plan was seven minutes. But we're calling an audible, because that's her call. Because she's the quarterback. I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
pam Okay, stop watching me.
jim Okay, crazy. I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
pam Mm-hmm.
jim Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal. While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
pam Not until midnight.
andy Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
erin I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
andy My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
jim You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
michael No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
jim Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
pam Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
michael Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!
michael Um, I am sort of a master of distraction. When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class. Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
michael The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
andy Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
michael I will allow that.
andy Yes! Can anyone do those?
stanley I'm going to go look at the Internet.
jim Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one.
pam Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.
michael Okay.
kelly Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
pam Oh, thanks, Kelly.
michael Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
pam Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
michael Yes, Phyl?
phyllis I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
michael Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
andy I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
michael That sounds good! Do you need some music, or. ? Okay.
andy Nope, actually music would just throw me off. I need complete silence. Okay. You're clapping. I need complete silence. Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over. Evolution of dance-dance.
ryan "You let me in your bed. But now, I sleep alone. Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home. "
erin Affirmed. Seattle Slew. Secretariat. Citation. Assault. Count Fleet. Rollaway. War Admiral. Omaha. Gallant Fox. And. I know this. Uh. The jockey was Johnny Loftus. Sired by Star Shoot.
angela Good afternoon.
dwight Have a seat.
angela What is this?
dwight Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
angela Of course.
dwight It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
angela You know I was thinking.
dwight Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item
one Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus. Agreed?
angela Agreed.
michael Where are we? We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
kevin For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
jim Okay, you know what? I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call. He'd probably know.
pam Jim, please. Happy thoughts here. Happy times.
michael Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.
jim Alright.
michael Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.
erin Um, stimulate the nipples.
michael Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
kevin Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
meredith I have a shirt like that in my car.
michael Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
erin Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
michael Okay, the opposite of that?
kevin Stick spicy food up her butt.
jim Nope, nope, nope, nope. Come on, let's go to the hospital. Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
pam Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
jim Mm-hmm. Okay, great. Well, sorry.
pam Why don't you go do some work?
jim Great. I will do that. Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled. And you know how very rarely I use that word. Frazzled.
pam I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
jim No, I don't.
pam Okay.
jim Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now. Totally.
michael Ooh, someone's freakin'.
andy A little frazzled.
michael I think he is.
jim I know pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy, she's crazy. I'm not crazy, she's crazy. Five to seven minutes. Five to seven minutes. Six minutes. Different, but not really. Five to seven minutes.
dwight Acceptable names include and are limited
to Ebenezer.
angela Jedediah.
dwight Jonas.
angela Jedediah.
dwight Warf.
angela No Star Trek names.
dwight Okay. Fine.
angela What if it's a girl?
dwight Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.
angela Hey. Uh-uh. I cannot control that. You can't put that in here.
dwight Yes you can.
angela No.
dwight It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after s*x, and then extremely cold for five months.
angela Absolutely not.
jim Hey.
pam Hey. I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
jim Ah, you know me too well.
pam Okay, Jim.
jim Yeah? . Oh.
pam Everything is fine. You don't have to worry. Try not to think about it. She's not coming out for a while, okay?
jim Did you say "she?"
pam I called the doctor like a week ago. I couldn't wait. Oh, God, don't be mad.
jim Mad? How could I be mad? We're having a little girl.
pam Mm-hmm.
jim Wow, we're having a little girl. Oh, man.
pam I know.
jim Woo, alright. Well, I definitely feel better.
pam Good.
jim Yeah.
pam Okay.
jim Alright. Hey, did you change?
pam Oh, yeah, my water broke.
jim Oh. Oh.
pam Oh, whoa. Ha. Wow.
michael Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?
phyllis No, it's 4
 35.
michael 4
 35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have s*x like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
pam No, not yet, Michael.
michael We can do.
pam Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast! Where's Kevin?
michael Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with kevin and not go to the hospital?
oscar That's fancy feast. Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
michael What is October feast?
pam There is no rush to get to the hospital. I am fine. I'll get there. And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
kevin Our ultra feast menu's
theme Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I. Are you okay?
pam Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
michael Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
jim Alright. Time to go. Okay.
michael That's right, let's do this.
jim Let's give it a shot.
pam Nope. No, no, that's better. That wasn't even the worst of them. I'm fine.
jim Hey, come on. Let's go to the hospital.
pam They're not that bad still, babe.
jim Pam, Pam, it's time. Let's go to the hospital.
pam No, it's passing, it's fine. It's okay.
jim Come on, michael says we should go now.
michael Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.
pam No, it's passing, it's fine.
jim Pam.
pam Ah, no, it passed. It's good.
jim You know what? Let's go. We got to go to the hospital.
pam Okay, I'm not going. I'm not. It's fine. Okay, come on, come on. No! I am not going! I am not going, okay!? I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
jim Hey, are you kidding me?
michael Are you kidding?
jim If anyone can do this, you can do this.
michael You can do this. You can do this.
jim Pam, I'm scared. I'm real scared.
michael I'm scared, too.
kevin I'm petrified.
jim The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
michael Yeah.
jim A really awesome baby.
michael We're going to have a baby.
jim So let's have it at the hospital.
michael Let's do that.
jim How are we doing on contractions?
michael Two minutes apart.
jim Two minutes.
pam Oh, God. Oh, no.
jim Michael, I told you.
michael It's okay.
jim No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
pam Jim, we waited too long!
michael I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.
jim We waited too long! Two minutes doesn't do us any good. Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
michael We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?
pam I don't want to have my baby here.
michael You're not going to. You know where you're going?
pam The hospital.
michael Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?
pam A baby.
michael Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
michael I got it! I got it! Everybody it's go time! At your stations. Stanley, man the phones. Meredith, please, get bottled water. Erin, call an ambulance, please!
dwight No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
jim Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
michael No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.
jim Alright, I have my wallet.
michael Yes.
jim Go bag's in the car. Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
michael Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?
erin There's nothing in it.
michael You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
oscar The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
dwight Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!
pam Dwight, get away!
michael No, no, no. Dwight, let jim do that, please.
erin I didn't know we had a tape measure.
dwight "We" don't.
jim Okay, I can't find my keys! I cannot find my keys! Found 'em. They're here. Dwight, jim and

dwight Right over by that fence.
michael By the bushes?
jim Okay, Michael! Focus!
michael Okay, go, go, go, go!
dwight Let's go!
dwight I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.
jim Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.
michael Okay, just breathe. She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.
pam Michael!
michael Yeah?

jim Okay.
pam It has the birth song on it!
jim Okay. I know, I know. But my iPod is in the go bag. We'll be fine.
pam Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
jim Okay, so what do you want to do?
pam I don't know! Let's go by the house and get it. It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
jim Pam, no! Are you nuts? We're going to the hospital now.
michael Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go. Ready?
dwight dwight Schrute.
michael Hello, Dwight. pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.
dwight Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
michael Okay.
pam Dwight! Go to my house. Get my iPod. I think it's on the kitchen table. Do not touch anything else. The key is under.
dwight I don't need a key.
pam Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the.
dwight No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
pam dwight just listen! It's underneath.
michael Okay.

jim Michael, just go park the car.
michael Okay, alright. Hospital
employee Sir! You can't park here!
michael Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay. I just did. . push;
jim Pam's doing great. Uh, she's ten inches dilated now. Uh, sorry, meters. Centimeters. And she's also fully faced. Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet. It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
nurse Daddy? She's ready to push.
jim Okay.
michael Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.
jim Doing great, push again.

doctor Okay. Really push this time, Pam.
pam Okay.
michael Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.
michael That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
andy Hey, have you guys seen her?
meredith She hasn't popped yet.
andy What? God damn it. She was supposed to come out yesterday.
andy I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born. This frame set me back fifty five bones. But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
phyllis This is ridiculous. We just can't wait here.
michael I think it's going to be any minute now.
phyllis But you don't know that. I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
michael Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
phyllis I have an ice cream cake in the car.
michael Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.
michael Guys? Hello? Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna.
pam This is happening!
michael You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
jim Oh, my God! Look at her! baby, she's so beautiful! Oh, my God.
pam Oh, my God.
michael Yeah, that's right. It's a baby, see?
doctor Sir! Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Put it, put it out.
michael Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
pam She's incredible. Want to count her fingers and toes again?
jim No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
pam Okay.
michael Guys, guys!
jim Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
michael Eleven pounds.

everyone Yeah!

heleen Hi there.
jim Hey, grandma's back.
helene Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
jim Great.
pam Oh, thank God. I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
helene Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.
jim Oh. Let me get it.
jim I am a diapering master. I have done little else in the past two months. There is nothing I cannot diaper. Go ahead. Try to think of something. I dare you.
michael Where's the baby? I want to see the baby. Oh! Oh, Helene, hi. Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this? Congratulations on being a grandma.
helene Hello, Michael.

michael Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
pam Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
michael Alright.
pam Again, no pants.
michael Oh, okay.
jim Ready?
michael Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.
jim It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
dwight Yesterday, I was dispatched to jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask jim where he bought his marvelous sheets. Time to get to work .
michael There she sat. Her name was Pam. She was a receptionist. She was engaged to an animal. There sat Jim. He was a gawky, tall salesman. The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able. I made a family! I got these two together, and I made a family.
andy This man has a gift!
michael Who else here is single?
kelly I'm not single. I have a man.
michael I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with pam and Jim. I can help you, too.
stanley Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
michael Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where stanley has two lovers and you don't have any? Who else? Come on! People, I know models!
ryan Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
michael Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.
meredith You know it. I am never getting married.
meredith Like Clooney.
michael Andrew, what about you?
andy Torn scrotum. Still on the mend, so not good timing.
andy Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
michael Well, when you least expect it, expect it. I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love. I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person. And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
pam Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
jim We were just kids. What did we know?
nurse How we doing?
jim Great.
pam Good.
nurse Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
pam Doesn't she sleep here?
nurse She can. But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest. You've been through a lot.
jim I think we'll be okay.
nurse Okay, great.
pam Oh, big yawn.
jim Ready? One, two, three.
pam One, and then wrap around. It's okay. Hold that arm down.
jim I can't. She's too strong. She's, careful, though. You don't want to break it.
pam She's not gonna. Just.
jim I got it. Alright.
pam Go.
jim Nurse!
jim How you doing?
pam I don't know. I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
jim Really?
pam Doesn't feel right.
jim Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
pam How does one do that?
jim Wasn't it. It's kinda like a. Like that.
pam Do you want to try it, Jim?
jim I think you're good. Doing a good job.
nurse Somebody buzzed?
jim Oh! Really? Must have sat on it, Pam.
pam I can't tell if she's getting anything. It just doesn't really feel right.
nurse Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while. I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
pam Even if she's not getting anything?
nurse Yeah, she'll be fine. I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.
pam No. I read in the book about nipple confusion.
nurse Oh, good. You know everything.
pam She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
nurse Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
jim Alright.
nurse Alright.
jim It's going to be alright.
pam Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
jim Ha ha. No, yeah, that will be good.
erin You wanted to see me?
michael What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
erin Oh, boy! . What's that sound?
kevin Ta-da!
michael I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
kevin Yes!
erin I don't know what to say.
kevin Oh, say nothing. You will learn to love me.
michael Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?
kevin Erin, would you have lunch with me?
erin Okay.
michael Good!
kevin Yes!
erin Michael, could I talk to you privately?
michael Sure. Kevin, please leave.
kevin Bye.
michael Bye.
erin I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not. I like Andy.
michael Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
erin I'm sure he'll be fine.
michael I'm not so sure. kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.
erin Really?
michael No, kevin doesn't have an elephant heart. But he is very sensitive. And it won't kill erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him. I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
erin I don't want anyone to die.
michael Just don't let him sit on you. I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.
kevin Hi.
erin Hi.
kevin She touched my shoulder.
nurse Hey, guys. We're short on rooms, so this is dale and Kathy.
jim Oh, hi.
kathy Hi.
dale Hi, so sorry.
jim Careful. Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
pam I know.
jim You see that? I'm pretty sure she's. Hi.
erin Did you grow up around here?
kevin No.
erin So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
kevin Yes.
andy Why was I hiding behind the plant? Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class. Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class. And then, uh, they would say things like "Oh, this guy's going to fail this class, " or, "What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?" And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, "Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people? Busted. " . Oh, the reason? The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that erin and kevin were kind of hitting it off, and. I was jealous. Hospital
