michael_scott Ahhhhhhhhh. I'm hungry.
michael_scott Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
michael_scott Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
dwight_schrute Take a seat down there. Second from the end.
michael_scott Alright, everybody here? Yes.
pam_beesly Popcorn anyone?
michael_scott Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!
pam_beesly Anyone else? Nooo.
pam_beesly Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.
michael_scott Entourage!
michael_scott Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?
kevin_malone Yes!
dwight_schrute Why him?
michael_scott Don't whine. Get the window.
michael_scott Previously on Varsity Blues...
kevin_malone Ok. Billy-Bob, got a head injury, but coach made him play. So then Lance, he gets sacked, he's out for the year...
jan_levinson Hello?
dwight_schrute Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.
angela_martin I don't approve. I don't.
jan_levinson Hello?
michael_scott Hi Jan! Hope you brought the Milk Duds!
jan_levinson How would a movie increase productivity Michael? How on earth would it do that?
michael_scott People work faster after...
jan_levinson Magically?
michael_scott No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
jan_levinson No.
angela_martin Kitchen.
angela_martin Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
dwight_schrute That's not going to happen.
angela_martin You know she has it out for him now.
dwight_schrute That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!
dwight_schrute Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.
angela_martin Dwight, you should be running this office.
dwight_schrute Michael would never let me...
angela_martin It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
dwight_schrute I could never do that!
angela_martin Fine! Sit back and do nothing and let us all get fired!
angela_martin I know that patience and loyalty are good, and virtuous traits. But sometimes I just think you need to grow a pair.
jim_halpert At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.
pam_beesly Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here.
pam_beesly Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.
pam_beesly Ok.
kelly_kapoor I love it!
pam_beesly Really? I don't know.
kelly_kapoor You haven't even tried it on yet, try it on.
pam_beesly Not at work, I'll try it on---
kelly_kapoor Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!
pam_beesly ...noooo
kelly_kapoor Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch! Fashion show! Fashion show! Fashion show at lunch!
andy_bernard Why did you do that?!
jim_halpert I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
andy_bernard We're on the German team. Shoot the Brittish.
jim_halpert Wait, are we playing teams?
karen_filippelli Yeah.
dwight_schrute WAH! GAH!
jan_levinson Hello?
dwight_schrute Is this Jan?
jan_levinson Who is this?
dwight_schrute This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
jan_levinson You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
dwight_schrute It's about Michael.
jan_levinson What about him?
dwight_schrute I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.
jan_levinson It's not about a surprise party is it?
dwight_schrute No, but we should discuss that another time.
jan_levinson Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
dwight_schrute Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
jan_levinson How do you know I like that store?
dwight_schrute Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
jan_levinson How do you know that?
dwight_schrute Part of my job.
jan_levinson No it's not. It's officially not.
dwight_schrute ...noted.
dwight_schrute I'm going... to the dentist.
michael_scott Ok.
dwight_schrute I have to have an emergency crown put in.
michael_scott Ouchy.
dwight_schrute Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours.
michael_scott Three hours, wow. Have fun.
dwight_schrute Did you get anything good?
jan_levinson Yeah.
dwight_schrute New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?
dwight_schrute I can save the branch.
jan_levinson Really?
dwight_schrute If you let me run it.
jan_levinson Ok.
dwight_schrute "Ok" I can run it?
jan_levinson What would you do differently?
dwight_schrute Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.
jan_levinson Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
dwight_schrute The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So , here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision.
dwight_schrute Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings.
jan_levinson Where is it?
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott Hi.
jan_levinson I just had a very interesting conversation with one of your employees.
michael_scott Oh. That's nice.
jan_levinson No, it wasn't. Dwight just told me that he thinks he can run the branch better than you.
michael_scott ...what?
jan_levinson Mm-hmm.
michael_scott ...you were at the dentist?
jan_levinson You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately.
michael_scott Ok.
michael_scott What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish.
phyllis_vance Woooooow.
kelly_kapoor It's so sexy. You look so hot.
phyllis_vance It's really something.
pam_beesly It's too much.
kelly_kapoor What?
pam_beesly I'm gonna return it.
kelly_kapoor No, you have to keep it today, just see how you feel.
roy_anderson Hey.
pam_beesly Hi.
roy_anderson You look nice.
pam_beesly Thanks.
kelly_kapoor Isn't that like your third soda today?
jim_halpert Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company. Ok, see you next week. Bye. Again?
karen_filippelli Scared?
karen_filippelli Call of Duty!
josh_porter Andy, Jim, can I see you in the conference room for a minute?
andy_bernard Now?
josh_porter Yes now.
andy_bernard Put the game on hold everyone.
josh_porter This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there.
andy_bernard It's the new guy.
jim_halpert Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
andy_bernard See what I mean?
josh_porter We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the gun room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?
jim_halpert Um, sniper rifle?
josh_porter SNIPE--
andy_bernard WHAT?
josh_porter JIM!
andy_bernard Are you playing for the other team?!
josh_porter You don't snipe in Carrington, ok?
andy_bernard Saboteur!
josh_porter Andy, it's not---
andy_bernard Saboteur! I'm going to kill you for real. This game--- the game is over. I'm really going to shoot you.
michael_scott Hey Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hey.
michael_scott Do you want an M&M?
dwight_schrute No thanks I'm stuffed.
michael_scott No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good.
dwight_schrute ...ok.
michael_scott They're good, huh?
dwight_schrute ...so good.
michael_scott Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
dwight_schrute They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
michael_scott Sounds like a good dentist.
dwight_schrute Oh, yeah.
michael_scott What's his name?
dwight_schrute Crentist.
michael_scott Your dentist's name is Crentist.
dwight_schrute Yep.
michael_scott Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.
dwight_schrute Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
michael_scott Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.
dwight_schrute Ahh. Aaaah.
michael_scott You should... floss.
dwight_schrute I know...
michael_scott Well then... I am glad you're ok.
michael_scott Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch? Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology.
michael_scott Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?
michael_scott Wow, this is tough.
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!
dwight_schrute What is it?
michael_scott Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
dwight_schrute Gahh!
michael_scott And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
dwight_schrute I can't believe this news. That--- wow.
michael_scott I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.
dwight_schrute You said that?
michael_scott Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it.
dwight_schrute Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will.
michael_scott Perfect, well, we're settled.
dwight_schrute All right.
michael_scott All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
dwight_schrute Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it.
michael_scott Ohh..
dwight_schrute Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
michael_scott Can't you? That's so nice.
michael_scott Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
dwight_schrute Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. Ok let's do it.
michael_scott Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.
phyllis_vance You're kidding...
michael_scott You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
angela_martin Congratulations Dwight.
dwight_schrute Thank you Angela.
stanley_hudson But... why Dwight?
michael_scott Because, Dwight... never lies.
stanley_hudson How does that qualify him to run a branch?
michael_scott Because that's all it takes.
michael_scott Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
dwight_schrute Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!
phyllis_vance Michael, what will you do?
michael_scott Oh, I'll be fine.
kevin_malone Do you have any savings?
michael_scott No, no, I don't, but---
kevin_malone Michael, you might lose your condo.
michael_scott I... won't. I won't.
pam_beesly I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken. If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.
phyllis_vance Maybe I'll quit.
angela_martin It's really happening!
dwight_schrute Yes.
angela_martin We can make a difference here.
dwight_schrute I, will, make a difference here.
angela_martin You alone? Because I thought together we could---
dwight_schrute Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women.
karen_filippelli Look how cute he is! He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.
jim_halpert I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
karen_filippelli I'm sorry nothing, just concentrate on turning around.
jim_halpert I'm trying---
karen_filippelli Just tap S then D.
jim_halpert Oh.
karen_filippelli Any... last words? No?
jim_halpert What?
jim_halpert Wow. Psychopath.
pam_beesly What?
creed_bratton I'm just looking.
pam_beesly Please go back to your desk.
creed_bratton In a minute.
pam_beesly Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work. But I'm gonna keep the clothes. I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.
michael_scott Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
dwight_schrute No thank you.
michael_scott It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
dwight_schrute No thanks.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute Not my style.
michael_scott But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.
dwight_schrute Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
michael_scott Take it back.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott That's my car.
dwight_schrute What did you---
michael_scott THAT'S MY CAR.
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know.
dwight_schrute You know what?
michael_scott Jan called me about your little meeting!
dwight_schrute No!
michael_scott I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
dwight_schrute I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.
michael_scott Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?
dwight_schrute Don't fire me. Please.
michael_scott Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
dwight_schrute I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
michael_scott Not. Good. Enough!
dwight_schrute I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year!
michael_scott I have a laundry machine!
dwight_schrute I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear.
michael_scott I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
dwight_schrute You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?
michael_scott You can get up. Get up. And you can hug it out, bitch.
michael_scott Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.
jim_halpert
karen_filippelli
michael_scott Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.
