pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
michael Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
pam angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.
dwight Aah!
phyllis Wow, thirteen!
dwight Yes!
michael No. No, no. There was wind.
dwight I was just jogging.
michael Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
jim No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
michael I want another try. Here we go! Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
stanley There was a car.
michael I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
oscar Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
michael Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
oscar That's impossible.
michael Beat it!
michael Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by Chief Financial Officer, david Wallace. He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so. probably bad.
pam Quick
announcement new year, new candy.
kevin Whoo-hoo!
pam Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
kevin Hot tamales.
pam Yeah.
kevin Uh oh.
pam So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more.
andy Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just. No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.
michael Wait, you still don't know.
jim No, no. Nope.
andy Hmm?
jim Nothing.
michael You still don't know.
jim Why don't. Let's.
michael What are you doing?
jim How about we just. Just have to talk to you for a second.
michael Andy.
jim Ahh!
andy No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.
michael No, what I'm saying is.
jim No, no.
michael No, that's not it.
jim I know.
jim andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just. awkward.
michael How can he still not know?
jim We can't figure that out.
michael I can't take it anymore.
dwight Wait, what? You can't take what?
michael I am telling Andy.
dwight No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
michael Who should it come from, then?
everyone Angela.
michael Are you still having intercourse with her?
oscar What is wrong with you? She is engaged.
michael Did you ever have intercourse in this office?
oscar Are you serious? Ugh. Where? Where? Where, Dwight?
dwight Seems like you already know where.
angela Kevin, you screwed this form up again. The amount owed goes at the top.
kevin Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was doing something wrong. If I had, I would've admitted it, and stopped right away.
angela That's enough.
kevin Because I wouldn't want an innocent person, who doesn't know anything about the form. What?
oscar That was good. It's just, at the end you weren't saying something that could also apply to the form.
kevin How about, "I'm sorry I did such a whorish job filling out this form?"
oscar There you go.
andy That cannot be true! You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself.
dwight Trade seats with me.
jim No.
dwight I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
jim Please stop.
dwight I need a soup spoon.
dwight Rule 17
 don't turn your back on bears, men you have wronged, or the dominant turkey during mating season. There are forty rules all Schrute boys must learn before the age of five. Learn your rules. You better learn your rules. If you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep.
dwight 
angela What is it?
dwight You've got to tell andy about us.
angela That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
dwight Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
angela You're expanding on your worst idea.
dwight Do you love me or not?
angela I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
dwight Because you're engaged to Andy.
angela 
michael Well?
dwight Not yet.
jim When?
andy When what? When what?
michael You know this can't go on.
andy What can't go on?
michael We have to put an end to this.
andy Seems like.
michael Come on.
andy You guys should. be hearing what I'm saying.
jim This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
dwight angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
michael When will she be ready?
dwight I don't know.
michael Is she crazy in bed?
dwight Yes.
jim Stop. What?
michael How so, specifically?
jim Okay, listen.
dwight Eager.
jim This shouldn't happen at work.
dwight And flexible.
jim And!
michael Really?
jim This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
michael It's too late.
jim Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
michael I am already walking.
dwight Michael, once this gets out. I don't know how it's going to go down.
michael Okay, what does that mean?
dwight Might get ugly.
michael Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
jim But you're leaving.
dwight Have a good trip.
michael Thanks. Andy?
andy Yeah.
michael Walk with me.
andy Will do, boss-man.
michael Ohh, I do not have much time. car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say. say these things, that. are bad things. that you hear. in your ears. this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear.
andy You're not making any sense.
michael Well. no, I'm not. So I. I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
andy All righty.
michael Which will be fine. I am off!
andy Have a good meeting!
michael Thank you!
andy Kick Wallace's ass!
michael Okay. I will. dwight and angela are having an affair, so.
andy I can't hear you through the glass
michael dwight and angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
andy What?
michael All right. See you later. Ahh.
andy Are you serious?
michael Yep.
meredith I knew something bad was gonna happen today.
oscar You said that yesterday.
meredith Yeah, my neighbor got murdered.
jim What are you standing for?
dwight If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
jim You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
dwight If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
jim Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit.
andy I need to talk to you.
angela We can talk right here.
andy I need to talk to you in private.
kevin We're not listening.
andy Let's go to the conference room. . push;
andy Is it true?
angela What have you heard?
andy That you're sleeping with Dwight.
angela That doesn't sound like me.
andy Is it true?
angela Andy, I'm engaged to you. I mean, we just signed off on our wedding flowers. Would I have said yes to formal chrysanthemums if I didn't want to get married? And, we went through all that stuff with our wedding cake.
andy Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?
angela A little bit.
andy How long has it been going on?
angela I don't know. I mean, we were together, and then he killed sprinkles, and then we stopped, and. I don't know exactly when we started up again.
andy Who else knows about it?
angela Michael.
andy Who else?
angela Let me think about it. I, um. there.
andy Oh God. Come on!
david So listen, Michael, your branch has been doing great lately, and your sales staff is reporting very strong numbers. Out-performing last year, in fact. Um, and I don't know exactly how to put this, but. what are you doing right?
michael Right what?
david Utica, Albany, all the other branches are struggling, but your branch is reporting strong numbers. Look, you're not our most traditional guy, but clearly, something you are doing. is right. And I just, I need to get a sense of what that is.
michael David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter. where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or. or where you've been. ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
michael Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.
michael This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.
david Here's the thing. michael is doing something right. And in this economic climate, no method of success can be ignored. It's not really time for executives to start getting judgmental now. It's Hail Mary time.
michael Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
david What say we do.
angela Standard, you know? Nothing fancy.
andy So like, missionary.
angela I said nothing fancy.
andy Do you love him?
angela I love you.
andy Why should I believe that?
angela Andy, we are at a crossroads here. And we can either give in to what people are saying that we're not good together.
andy Who says that?
angela Or, we can prove them wrong. Let's prove them wrong.
andy Where's Dwight?
jim You okay, man?
andy No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.
creed You are welcome.
andy Dwight.
dwight Andy.
andy It's over.
dwight Oh good. She broke up with you.
andy No. It's over between you two.
dwight Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
andy You have to.
dwight No I don't.
andy She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
dwight Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
andy angela Bernard.
dwight Will never be her name.
andy It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
dwight I don't think so.
jim Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
andy I'm telling you to back down.
dwight And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
andy Then I'll make you.
dwight Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
andy Through the use of force.
dwight That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
andy I will fight you.
jim Nope.
dwight Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
andy Fine!
dwight Fine!
oscar This is nuts.
dwight What is your weapon?
jim Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because.
dwight Hey, this is none of your business.
jim Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
andy Guess what? Not happening at work.
dwight Yes!
andy We're gonna do it outside.
dwight Outside of work.
andy None of your business.
dwight None of your business then. Good. So what weapon?
andy My bare hands.
dwight That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
andy Then I'll get something too.
meredith I've had two men fight over me before. Usually it's over which one gets to hold the camcorder.
pam Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.
angela I will respect the results of the duel.
pam Of course you will.
meredith I call loser!
andy I will be taking my break at 4
 00 in the parking lot.
dwight I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
andy What a coincidence.
dwight Mm.
jim So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day. leaving dwight in charge. Oh God.
jim 
dwight How'd that get there?
meredith There's a star-shaped thing taped under the kitchen table.
jim Thanks Meredith.
michael So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is kevin Malone. kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, "Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?" And he looks at me and he says, "Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket. " And I look back at him and I say, "I feel the need!. The need for tweed. "
david It's hard to try and evaluate yourself, Michael, but I appreciate you trying. And thanks for coming in.
michael Oh, thank you.
david Yes.
michael I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
david Yeah.
michael Okay.
david Yeah, finish up.
dwight Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
angela I can't believe they're gonna fight over me.
kelly I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
dwight Come on!
meredith Hey, has anything happened yet?
dwight Where are you?
oscar Mm-mm. It's 4
 10, I don't think he's gonna show.
kevin Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
dwight Come on, coward! Where are you? Where. "From the desk of Andrew Bernard. " A note. Pathetic. "Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested. " True. "The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly. "
kelly There's Andy, he's in his car. You guys, what is he doing?
phyllis Why isn't dwight turning around?
oscar The Prius is silent if he keeps it under five miles per hour. He deserves the win.
creed Yeah.
dwight Alas, after much consideration and deliberation.
pam Oh my God!
stanley What's happening?
phyllis Andy's running over dwight with his car.
dwight Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
andy Yeah. everyone
watching Oh!
dwight Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
andy You give up?
dwight Never! Get out and face me like a man!
andy I am a man! I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be! I would never sleep with another man's fiance!
dwight You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! All you do is dress fancy and sing. "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
andy Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?
dwight Last year, idiot!
jim Dwight! Are your legs broken?
dwight No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
jim Andy, are you all right?
andy Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!
dwight Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that!
andy What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
dwight I sa-
andy What? You stupid idiot! You're like, you're like a Sasquatch! You live in the woods.
dwight Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
andy I don't get it! How can she be sleeping with you this whole time and only sleep with me twice?
dwight What?
andy What!
dwight She's sleeping with you?
andy I'm her fiance.
dwight She said she was only sleeping with me.
andy Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat. Yep, that's the one.
dwight 
andy Thank you.
michael Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. Ahh!
dwight
