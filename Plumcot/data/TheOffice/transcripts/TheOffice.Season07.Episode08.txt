erin_hannon They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house.
Reporter#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode08 Police have now surrounded the apartment complex.
michael_scott They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
Reporter#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode08 It is unknown if he is armed with anything.
kevin_malone They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
dwight_schrute They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
angela_martin Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
gabe_lewis Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
erin_hannon It's pronounced wacko.
jim_halpert Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, Michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
kelly_kapoor Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out?
andy_bernard I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
kevin_malone No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
michael_scott Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! Come on everybody!
michael_scott There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!
michael_scott Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? Well kiddo, I was there. I was there... And I'll tell you what. You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
erin_hannon Michael!
michael_scott Walk with me.
erin_hannon Gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
michael_scott Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
jim_halpert Okay?
erin_hannon Yeah it's a TV show...
michael_scott Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
stanley_hudson I...
michael_scott Cancel it! Are you still here?
erin_hannon Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so...
michael_scott MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
erin_hannon Okay, sorry.
michael_scott I'm joking.
erin_hannon Wait which one?
michael_scott I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
erin_hannon Good me too!
michael_scott You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. I am coming to your party.
erin_hannon I don't know if Michael likes Gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
kelly_kapoor No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
kelly_kapoor And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
angela_martin Are you going?
dwight_schrute Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
angela_martin I would watch that.
dwight_schrute Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
andy_bernard You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
erin_hannon Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
andy_bernard You would?
erin_hannon You and Michael are always the life of the party!
andy_bernard Try and keep me from coming!
erin_hannon Why would I keep you from coming?
andy_bernard Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
erin_hannon Why would I hide it!
michael_scott Kevin!
kevin_malone Hey, you going tonight?
michael_scott Yes, I am. Are you?
kevin_malone Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
michael_scott What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
kevin_malone No he's not the boss.
michael_scott Why did you just say he was the boss?
kevin_malone 'Cause, you're the boss!
michael_scott Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
erin_hannon It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
michael_scott Uh huh...
erin_hannon Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
michael_scott Big...
erin_hannon Those posters used to be real French ads.
michael_scott All right!
gabe_lewis So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and...
michael_scott Okay okay okay.
michael_scott Gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!
michael_scott
gabe_lewis You don't really toss the dough.
michael_scott Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you.
gabe_lewis Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
jim_halpert You play?
gabe_lewis Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
jim_halpert You can't even do that.
Cece#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode08
pam_beesly She's up! Great!
pam_beesly Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
erin_hannon The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting!
phyllis_vance Who's that?
kelly_kapoor Finn.
phyllis_vance Who's that?
kelly_kapoor Rachel.
phyllis_vance Which one's Glee?
kelly_kapoor You have to stop.
michael_scott Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!
gabe_lewis It's a little loud...
michael_scott Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
gabe_lewis Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
michael_scott Well some of us are trying to have a...
gabe_lewis I'll just turn the captions on.
michael_scott Well I will turn up the volume.
gabe_lewis That's for the other box.
michael_scott Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
oscar_martinez That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night...
kelly_kapoor You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from...
oscar_martinez You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
pam_beesly Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
michael_scott Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
pam_beesly You have a gun in your desk?
ryan_howard Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say...
andy_bernard No what?
ryan_howard What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
andy_bernard Yeah.
michael_scott Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
dwight_schrute Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
pam_beesly Maybe I should go.
dwight_schrute Kelly. Kev- Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
darryl_philbin Take a shot.
andy_bernard Oh thanks.
darryl_philbin Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
andy_bernard Why does Erin like Gabe?
darryl_philbin Andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters... I'd choose you.
andy_bernard That's really nice, thank you.
darryl_philbin And I'd blow your mind.
andy_bernard
jim_halpert
oscar_martinez Jim what are you doing?
jim_halpert Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
oscar_martinez Flip it back please.
jim_halpert Okay...
kelly_kapoor The show's back on, what happened?
ryan_howard We're behind.
oscar_martinez Go to the recorded version.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God what song was that?
erin_hannon I wasn't recording it.
oscar_martinez What?!
kelly_kapoor What song was it?
erin_hannon Wait, why do you have to record it?
oscar_martinez This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
erin_hannon Jim.
kelly_kapoor Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? 'Cause we missed it!
pam_beesly If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
dwight_schrute That would be nice wouldn't it?
pam_beesly I can't even talk about it.
dwight_schrute You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
pam_beesly I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
dwight_schrute Really? Oh... Then here we are.
erin_hannon Michael. Gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some help so, he was wondering if you could help him.
andy_bernard Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, Phyllis Vance! Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
phyllis_vance You know your perfumes!
andy_bernard My nanny used to wear that.
andy_bernard I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! I feel exactly like a seahorse! Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
erin_hannon Look who I found!
michael_scott Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
gabe_lewis Let's go ahead and wash our hands.
michael_scott Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
gabe_lewis Yep! Waste not right?
michael_scott So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
erin_hannon Michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
michael_scott Well...
erin_hannon Gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
michael_scott He's the longest baby in this room.
erin_hannon What's the longest thing you've ever seen? For me it was the tale from Jets.
gabe_lewis Erin you don't have to...
michael_scott You know what Erin you do have to.
gabe_lewis Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
michael_scott That's what she said.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly It's a miracle. She loves him.
jim_halpert I don't know about, love...
dwight_schrute She loves me.
angela_martin Outside my car in two minutes.
dwight_schrute Well something's come up, I have to go.
pam_beesly No no no no no! She'll wake up!
dwight_schrute I have something to do.
pam_beesly Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
dwight_schrute I do. But you married my worst enemy.
jim_halpert Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
dwight_schrute Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
pam_beesly Absolutely!
dwight_schrute From Jim.
jim_halpert I don't think that's gonna...
pam_beesly Do it!
jim_halpert What kind of pizza would you like?
dwight_schrute Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
michael_scott Okay... Alright.
TV#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode08 And the winner is, by two votes-
kelly_kapoor Ahhh! What's going on?!?!
andy_bernard Hey Creed, would you read Chinese?
creed_bratton Beleniege!
andy_bernard What does this say?
creed_bratton HI mahhhh. Boo yowww. Gunjo! Ooh uncow!
andy_bernard Hello UPS! Still waiting on that five minutes with Erin order. Oh never mind it's here. Oh if it isn't the bell of the ball! You throw a lovely party ma lady...
erin_hannon Are you having a good time?
andy_bernard Did you wear my favorite outfit on purpose?
erin_hannon Andy you look awful!
andy_bernard You're four seasons in a day. You... got the Autumn thing going on. But if you put on ba- Put if you put on a blue... It's Spring Time in the Rockies!
erin_hannon Are you alright?
andy_bernard No!
dwight_schrute Insert it in my mouth.
jim_halpert That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
dwight_schrute No, try me.
pam_beesly Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
dwight_schrute I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
jim_halpert Okay...
dwight_schrute No. Crust first. Okay, now the beer. Beer me Jim. Ssss. Gentle. Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
pam_beesly What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
dwight_schrute I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
jim_halpert You need to stop talking.
dwight_schrute Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. s*x contracts exist!
pam_beesly Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
dwight_schrute Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
jim_halpert Okay...
dwight_schrute You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
jim_halpert I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
pam_beesly No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
dwight_schrute She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
pam_beesly The reverse cycling ends tonight!
dwight_schrute A single piece of pepperoni please.
jim_halpert I'm not gonna-
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
kevin_malone I wanted to eat a pig in a blanket, in a blanket!
andy_bernard Puts pillow in front of the puke.
phyllis_vance Are you alright?
andy_bernard Erin likes Gabe.
phyllis_vance I know. I thought you two were nice together.
andy_bernard Do you think that they've ever...
phyllis_vance Made love? I don't know.
andy_bernard Well girls tell each other things right?
phyllis_vance I'll see what I can find out.
darryl_philbin Where you been?
michael_scott I just went out for a walk.
darryl_philbin Cable's out.
michael_scott What? Really? That stinks!
gabe_lewis It's still on upstairs.
michael_scott What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
creed_bratton Hey! Puck and Finn worked it out, and the solo is now a duet.
michael_scott Are you kidding me?
creed_bratton No.
michael_scott Now that's going on?
kevin_malone I can't believe we're missing that!
michael_scott Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot.
kevin_malone Please Michael, just make the Glee happen!
kelly_kapoor Good luck Michael!
phyllis_vance Erin! Uhm, so how long have you two been going out now?
erin_hannon Oh, uhm, like three months.
phyllis_vance And I imagine things are starting to heat up?
erin_hannon I don't know.
phyllis_vance Of course you don't wanna rush things! I mean the anticipation can be so exquisite. Bob and I took our time. The first time we saw each other naked we didn't even make love, we just stared at each other until we fell asleep. It was magical.
erin_hannon I have to go Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Magical...
pam_beesly Hey in there. It's Pam. It's not Dwight! Don't think it's Dwight!
angela_martin What are you doing here?
pam_beesly I know you and Dwight have this weird deal, uhm, he sent me out here to see if you could postpone.
angela_martin Are you authorized to do this?
pam_beesly Yes! I have been so authorized.
angela_martin Ok, uhm, then tell him that we'll do this tomorrow night instead.
pam_beesly Okay.
angela_martin Wait Pam! How did he seem? Like, you know, did he seem disappointed?
pam_beesly You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
angela_martin You know what Pam just save it.
erin_hannon You did this?
michael_scott No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
erin_hannon Why don't you like him?
michael_scott What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
erin_hannon I care if you like him.
michael_scott Why? I'm not your father. All right.
erin_hannon Okay...
michael_scott Go to your room.
erin_hannon What?
michael_scott Go to your room young lady!
erin_hannon Uhm, I'm not going to my room.
michael_scott You listen to me. You listen good. You are are not, to see that boy, anymore.
erin_hannon You listen to me. You are not to tell me what to do.
michael_scott As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
erin_hannon I hate your roof!
michael_scott Oh do not raise your voice to me!
erin_hannon I'll raise it how I want! I'll raise the roof!
michael_scott Gahh, I will pull this car over!
erin_hannon I hate it! I hate your car!
gabe_lewis See ya Oscar!
michael_scott If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
michael_scott Gabe, just go and have fun with Erin. But not too much fun! That girl's gonna turn my hair gray.
gabe_lewis What happened?
andy_bernard I accidentally ate some seahorses.
gabe_lewis How much?
andy_bernard I didn't know it's powdered, so like four or five, I don't know.
gabe_lewis I've got just the thing! This one's called Earth Rise, on the Moon.
andy_bernard That's so beautiful.
