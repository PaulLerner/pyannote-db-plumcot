jim All right, let's get started. Umm. Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So. let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also. what is this?
dwight Tape recorder.
jim For what?
dwight For recording. michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
jim OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?
karen Yeah, the deal closed yesterday, it's the six month commitment.
jim Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
dwight What?
jim You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
dwight I'm not.
jim Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
dwight I do not have a knife!
jim No, let the record show that dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
dwight Let the record show that jim Halpert is a liar!
jim dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
dwight Give me it. I am not.
phyllis Oh, jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for michael quickly.
dwight jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
karen Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
jim Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
dwight You can't see. You can't see my stomach.
andy I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! . Rin-in-in-in-in-in!
michael Hey, mon!
pam Hey. You have a bunch of messages and. that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.
michael Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
pam OK.
michael Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.
pam It's kind of serious.
michael Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
pam How was Jamaica?
michael It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon, " everybody says "Hey mon" back.
stanley Oh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.
michael Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
stanley My bonus check was a hundred dollars less than you promised.
michael OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
stanley They said I should talk to you.
michael Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna.
stanley I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.
michael You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers. mon.
jim You want to talk about it?
karen Nope.
karen I still haven't found an apartment yet. I'm living in a hotel. Yesterday, I saw a "for rent" sign down the street from jim and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea. He said it would be like we were living together. In different houses. Two blocks away.
michael Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.
pam That's good.
michael You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
pam Huh.
michael Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
pam It's kind of an impoverished country.
michael Yeah. Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
pam But you can't today, we're doing inventory.
michael Inventory's at the end of December.
pam We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.
michael I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
michael Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?
michael Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.
angela By the end of the day? That's impossible.
michael The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible. "
jim Yep, it's English, it's "impossible. "
angela Michael, there's no way we can do it in time.
michael How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.
michael Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling. and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? "No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem. " This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.
pam Oh my God. Is that Jan?
everybody What? Where?
pam On the left.
everybody Oh yeah, oh my God.
michael No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
michael jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. s*x. We had s*x. I had s*x with her. I had s*x with Jan.
michael Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.
packer Big whoop! I was in Hot-lanta. That whole town is whacked.
michael Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
packer You took the ice queen? I don't buy it.
michael Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
packer They wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.
michael Oh no?
packer No.
michael OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
packer Well, no. I got nothing.
michael Check it again. Hit refresh.
packer Yeah, Mike, still nothing.
michael OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at. Packer@DunderMifflin. com. Packaging@DunderMifflin. com. Uh oh.
packer Wait, I just got it from somebody else. Wow. This is hot. Damn! How do I get you out of this picture?
michael Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?
roy He's in the office.
michael OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
darryl All right, what's up Mike?
michael That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
darryl Yup.
michael OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging. " Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
darryl Uh huh.
michael OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
darryl Yup.
michael And you sent that out to everyone?
darryl Mike, I'm very busy down here.
jim Yikes.
kevin Already sent it to you my friend.
jim Fantastic.
andy Boring. Call me if she rolls over. . push;
pam Hey.
jim Hey.
pam You OK?
jim Yeah.
pam You sure?
jim Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.
pam Oh. You want to talk about it?
jim Really?
michael I have a special assignment for you.
dwight Who's the target?
michael A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican jan Sun Princess. "
dwight What's it of?
michael Not important.
dwight Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
michael OK, forget it.
dwight OK, I accept it.
jim So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.
pam Hmm.
jim Hmm, what?
pam How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?
jim Yeah, I guess.
pam Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.
pam No, I didn't mind helping jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.
jim Hey, thanks a lot.
pam Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to michael play a conch shell. which is what I was doing. Oh, also, michael went to Jamaica with Jan!
jim Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?
toby Hey I need to talk to you right now.
michael Not now, not ever.
toby About you and Jan.
michael Aww, none of your business.
toby Wish it were true, but it, it uh, seems from that photo that you took, you've entered into an intimate relationship.
michael That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
toby Michael, nine different people emailed me that photo, including my ex-wife. we don't talk now.
michael This is probably the icebreaker you need.
toby You know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.
michael I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
toby All right, if you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.
michael No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
toby All right, thanks Michael.
michael OK.
angela OK, we only have three hours people to plan a whole luau, and you're not helping.
karen What are the ingredients of poi?
phyllis I called every grocery store in Scranton, and no one sells whole pigs.
angela Did you try the petting zoo?
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's jan on the phone for you.
