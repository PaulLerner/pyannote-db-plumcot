dwight Hello. Jim?
jim What's up, buddy?
dwight This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
jim Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
dwight Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
jim Who, Steve?
dwight Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
pam Sorry. What do I want? What do I want. Oh, it's a pencil cup.
dwight No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.

dwight Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
pam I love these.
dwight Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
jim Oh, there it is. J1.
dwight But I don't have any.
jim Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
dwight Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five.
michael Hello, everyone.
dwight Good morning, Michael.
phyllis Where are we going this afternoon?
michael Ah! Ha ha ha!
pam Last week, michael sent out this mysterious memo.
jim "It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask. "
pam A ski mask and a swimsuit.
jim So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
pam And brush our teeth.
michael Yeah?
stanley Michael.
michael Stanley! Bo banley.
stanley I need to know.
michael Banana fana fo fanley.
stanley What we're doing.
michael Be my mo manley.
stanley You said bring a toothbrush.
michael Stanley.
stanley Is this an overnight?
michael Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
stanley Should my wife tell her boss she's not coming in tomorrow?
michael Maybe, I don't know.
stanley Not maybe. Yes or no.
michael Well, no. But. okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
stanley In January?
michael It's cheaper.
michael This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.
michael It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!
meredith All right!
ryan I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?
michael No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
ryan I'm already in business school.
michael Well, this.
kelly Wait, Michael?
michael Yeah?
kelly Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?
michael To throw you off the scent.
kelly Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.
michael Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
kelly I took the tags off already.
michael Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda. something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
michael I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and. it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.
michael Leader. ship. The word "ship" is hidden inside the word "leadership, " as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!
oscar Last year, Michael's theme was "Bowl over the Competition!" So guess where we went.
michael Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?
darryl How about the sales department is the sails?
michael Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
phyllis A furnace?
jim Yeesh, how old is this ship?
pam How about the anchor?
phyllis What does the furnace do?
michael All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just. it's the sales. I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
jim I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
michael Titanic?
pam I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.
michael No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
jim michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.
phyllis Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.
michael No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and. actually, that might be warehouse.
darryl What?
michael The. no, no. No, I didn't. okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is. leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
dwight Aye aye, Captain.
michael A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
michael Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. Uh. the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring. We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
dwight Cool. Captain
jack Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.
michael I'd rather die. Hi, I am michael Scott, I am the captain of this party. Captain
jack I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. Hi, welcome aboard.
michael Okay.
michael In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.
michael Hey, look! I'm king of the world! Captain
jack Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.
michael And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, michael Scott. Welcome, welcome! Captain
jack Okay! So.
michael Okay! So. Captain
jack Please. The life preservers.
michael Right. Captain
jack They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.
michael But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight. Captain
jack Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here.
michael I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna. Captain
jack Okay, Michael, if you don't mind.
michael Rock it! Captain
jack Please, okay?
michael If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'! Captain
jack Michael.
michael Yep. Captain
jack Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?
michael We're all gonna have a good time tonight! Captain
jack Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?
michael Hm? Okay. Yep. . push;
katy You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?
roy Yeah.
katy Pam, were you a cheerleader?
roy No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!
katy That's hilarious.
jim It's not hilarious, but.
roy Where did you go to school?
katy Bishop O'Hara.
roy Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You. you really look familiar. Did you. you cheered for them, didn't you?
jim Um, no.
katy Yes, I did! A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!
roy I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!
michael Having fun?
brenda Yeah. Everybody's really nice.
michael Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
brenda When are you going to start the presentation?
michael Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so. right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support. Captain
jack Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!
michael So, okay.
dwight Limbo, whoo! Captain
jack All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?
meredith Me. Captain
jack Okay.
dwight Me! Me, me, me. Captain
jack Uh. usually it's a woman.
dwight I'm stronger. Captain
jack Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight? Captain
jack Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!
dwight I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats. Captain
jack All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!
michael But before that, I have to do my presentation. Captain
jack Nope! Dance contest!
michael All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
michael Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
dwight What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
angela Hey, come inside and talk to me.
dwight I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?! darryl and
katy Snorkel shot! Snorkel shot!
roy Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!
pam No, I'm not going to do that.
roy Come on!
darryl That's what I'm talking about!
pam Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?
roy I've just gotta wait for darryl to do his shot. Just a minute. Come on! Darryl! Darryl!
pam It's getting kind of rowdy down there.
jim Yeah. Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
pam Sometimes I just don't get Roy.
jim Well.
pam I mean, I don't know. So. what's it like dating a cheerleader?
jim Oh, um.
pam I'm cold. Captain
jack So, what's this presentation all about?
michael Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save? Captain
jack Women and children.
michael No, no. Salesmen and profit centers. Captain
jack That's a stupid analogy.
michael Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership. Captain
jack Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
dwight Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
michael Okay.
dwight Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
katy I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?
pam Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So. you don't wanna ask my advice. Captain
jack Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?
jim Um. let's see, uh. The customer. Because the customer is king.
michael Not what I was looking for, but a good thought. Captain
jack He's just sucking up!
roy When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die? Captain
jack Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.
jim You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.
roy Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and. Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!
michael I don't want to take credit for this, but roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?
roy No, it was Captain Jack.
michael Well. could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great! Captain
jack We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!
michael Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
pam No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.
michael Then I'll give you away!
pam No, thank you.
katy Do you think that'll ever be us?
jim No.
katy What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?
jim I don't know. Let's break up.
katy Whoa. What? Captain
jack This is where Captain jack drives the boat.
meredith Wow!
dwight Seasick? Captain jack says you should look at the Moon.
michael Captain jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
brenda Really? What?
michael Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary. it's a. Captain
jack Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?
michael It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.
michael I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was. if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.
michael Is somebody there?
jim What happened to you?
michael Captain jack has a problem with authority.
jim Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
michael He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
jim What a night.
michael Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
jim She was always engaged.
michael roy said the first one didn't count.
jim That's. great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so.
michael Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan.
jim Yeah, I know.
michael Yeah? Yep. Well, pam is cute.
jim Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just. well, anyway.
michael Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.
jim She's engaged.
michael BFD. Engaged ain't married.
jim Huh.
michael Never, ever, ever give up.
dwight Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
michael It's a fake wheel, dummy.
