kevin_malone To me, the Sixers are a five seed tops.
jim_halpert I think they're going to the conference finals.
kevin_malone No.
jim_halpert Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-...
jim_halpert I bit my lip at lunch today.
darryl_philbin Sucks. Anyway, I just don't see it. The Knicks are tough.The Nets are tough.
kevin_malone Oh, the Nets are super tough.
jim_halpert Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.
kevin_malone The Hawks are terrible. They're always terrible.
jim_halpert Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the...
jim_halpert Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen... You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!
erin_hannon Good morning, Meredith.
pam_beesly What?
erin_hannon Oh, sorry, Pam. Yikes.
pam_beesly Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.
jim_halpert I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.
jim_halpert You sound tired. Everything ok?
pam_beesly Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?
jim_halpert Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
Worker#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode10 Jim, limo's here.
jim_halpert Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
pam_beesly Oh, call me later!
jim_halpert Ok
pam_beesly Good luck!
jim_halpert Thanks!
pam_beesly Love you.
jim_halpert Love you too. Bye.
val How you doing?
darryl_philbin Alright. I mean, it's what you want, so...
val It's how it has to be.
darryl_philbin I know, I know. It's just hard.
darryl_philbin Me and Val were going nowhere and if I'm gonna be working in Philly, I'm gonna need my freedom. So, I convinced Val to breakup with me. Here's how you do it. You say, "What are you gonna do, breakup with me?" Like it's a joke, and then you gain a lot of weight.
darryl_philbin I'll never be sorry, not for a moment of it.
val Me neither. Come here.
pam_beesly Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.
meredith_palmer Jeez H. in the morning. Will you stop your nagging already? No wonder Jim left you.
pam_beesly He didn't leave me. He just went part time. Can you just fill out the form please?
meredith_palmer Yes.
pam_beesly I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.
meredith_palmer Hurry up already.
erin_hannon Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Between the foster homes and the orphanage, I had lice 22 times.
erin_hannon Holy wow, that's a big one. Alright, pencils down everyone, we got lice!
angela_martin Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
dwight_schrute What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
pam_beesly Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.
dwight_schrute Just lice Pam?
dwight_schrute Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
dwight_schrute Make way, nope, inspect me.
erin_hannon Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
dwight_schrute Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.
pam_beesly Stop that!
angela_martin Dwight!
erin_hannon Next!
angela_martin Geez Meredith, you know, this is an office not one of your bean bag orgies.
pam_beesly Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.
oscar_martinez Pam, really? Come on.
meredith_palmer Hey, what do you want? I know who I am. Nobody's taken Meredith Palmer to the opera to meet the queen.
erin_hannon Lice. More lice. Angela has lice.
angela_martin Ew! Oh.
erin_hannon Ooh yabber, lice!
erin_hannon Yikers, lice.
pam_beesly No! How? I'm so clean!
erin_hannon Oh yeah, big time lice.
oscar_martinez I wash my hands at least six times a day. Toilet seat covers? Yes, thank you, even when I pee. Apparently, none of that is protection enough. Not when it comes to Meredith.
phyllis_vance What are you wearing?
dwight_schrute It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
nellie_bertram No.
kevin_malone No.
dwight_schrute Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
darryl_philbin Alright, we're going down to my warehouse, that means we're playing by my rules. No messing with the baler and be cool in front of me and Val. We just broke up.
phyllis_vance You got dumped?
darryl_philbin Yeah, she ended things.
nellie_bertram Breakups are the worst. The only thing that got me through mine are large amounts of shepard's pie and Brandy. The singer, not the drink.
kevin_malone Here man. You need that more than me.
darryl_philbin Thanks, man.
kevin_malone Yeah
pam_beesly Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.
angela_martin Oh, no no no no no. I have not yet begun to shame.
stanley_hudson That's it. I'm getting my stuff. I'm leaving for the day.
erin_hannon No! Stanley! If you leave now then you'll get it in your car and then you'll get it in your house!
stanley_hudson Get off me!
erin_hannon I'm trying to save you from yourself!
stanley_hudson Alright, I'll stay! There's a pencil broken in my rolls.
pam_beesly Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.
jim_halpert Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?
limo_driver Driver Yeah, take some home if you want.
jim_halpert Oh no, no, no. That's ok. Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?
limo_driver Driver No, Mr. Irving called. Said he'd rather meet you at his private court.
jim_halpert You gotta be kidding me.
pam_beesly Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.
meredith_palmer Yes, Pam what do you want?
pam_beesly Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?
meredith_palmer Baking a cake, what does it look like I'm doing? Getting rid of the lice.
pam_beesly Oh stop! I am so sorry!
meredith_palmer Oh, can you hold that thought? That's my wax. You know, I think these critters migrated from down south. What were you saying?
pam_beesly Nothing.
pam_beesly I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
dwight_schrute Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
erin_hannon No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
dwight_schrute To be burned!
erin_hannon To be washed.
angela_martin What do we do about our heads?
dwight_schrute I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
erin_hannon No, all we need is mayonnaise.
angela_martin Excuse me?
pam_beesly She's right, it works. I would imagine.
erin_hannon Yes, it helps to suffrocate the little buddies and it's a really healthy alternative to the chemicals found in most lice shampoos.
oscar_martinez I can appreciate that. I also only eat local, organic produce.
meredith_palmer Shaboom! How do you like me now!?
angela_martin Oh.
oscar_martinez Wow.
meredith_palmer Take a picture. It will last longer.
angela_martin We don't want it to last longer. It's horrible.
creed_bratton Bald people make me sick.
meredith_palmer Yeah, yeah, everybody pile on Meredith. But I'm the only one with the balls to show them lice who's boss.
erin_hannon Ok, nobody panic. If everybody just follows my instructions, then nobody else needs to end up bald. Not that it looks bad, Meredith. It looks...It looks awesome. You look like a baby who suddenly aged 50 years. A cute baby, but something sucked the life force out of it. I'm so sorry. We need mayonnaise! We need it now.
pam_beesly Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.
angela_martin Okay. Oh, thank you.
oscar_martinez You're a saint, Pam.
pam_beesly No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?
meredith_palmer Thanks Pam! I'll take a pack of Nicorette gum and a pack of Kools.
pam_beesly Okay.
dwight_schrute Let's talk pubes, people.
val Hey, Darryl.
darryl_philbin Oh, hey Val.
nellie_bertram Oh, that was tragic, Oh, that was like a car crash. I couldn't look away. You two clearly still have feelings for each other.
darryl_philbin Yeah.
phyllis_vance What's gonna make you feel better, big guy?
darryl_philbin When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn't feeling good. She's not around to do that anymore. I'm sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.
nellie_bertram Aw, poor Darryl. I can't bear to see him suffer like this.
kevin_malone I think he needs some hugs, and maybe some chocolate cake.
phyllis_vance Mmm, this won't help him, it's a muffin, not cake.
nellie_bertram Listen, let's try and get Darryl the one thing in the world he clearly wants and needs the most.
kevin_malone An Escalade.
nellie_bertram Or what's her name.
phyllis_vance Val.
nellie_bertram Let's get Darryl Val.
julius_erving Irving I hope you don't mind me bringing you out here. I can't get my knees under a desk.
jim_halpert Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
julius_erving Well, do you think you can sink one from deep?
jim_halpert Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
julius_erving Okay. Wow, Halpert's got game.
jim_halpert Alright. Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
julius_erving It's your wife? You better take it.
jim_halpert Right! Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
pam_beesly Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.
jim_halpert It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
pam_beesly He's really making you work for it, huh?
jim_halpert Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
pam_beesly Great. I am killing it over here. Jim, I gotta go.
jim_halpert Okay, bye. So sorry about that.
julius_erving No problem. Hey Jim, what size do you wear, man? I got a pair of japanese Nikes with your name on them. What do you think?
jim_halpert I love it.
erin_hannon Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
dwight_schrute Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.
stanley_hudson Put those away before you hurt yourself.
dwight_schrute Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
erin_hannon Okay, it's easier with a buddy, so everybody pair up.
angela_martin Oscar, do you want to be my partner?
oscar_martinez Yeah, yeah, sure. I'd love to..
creed_bratton Hey, uh, mayo buddy, five dollar tip, you unclog my ears. Okay?
erin_hannon Oh, Creed, I'm so sorry. I'm...I'm already partners with Pete, right Pete?
pete_miller Uh, yeah. We promised each other if we ever got lice, we'd buddy up. Sorry, man.
pam_beesly Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?
creed_bratton Oh God. Stuck with the weirdo.
oscar_martinez Angela.
angela_martin You don't want bugs. You know? Who knows where those bugs will end up?
meredith_palmer You're getting a bargain. I ain't got no hair no more.
pam_beesly Creed, I'm all done. My turn.
creed_bratton I'm sorry, Pam. It looks a little messy.
pam_beesly Well, wait.
pete_miller How's that?
erin_hannon I feel it working. Eiffel tower!
val Can I help you?
phyllis_vance Well, we don't want to pry but we heard you broke up with Darryl.
val Yeah, that's true.
phyllis_vance We think you made a big, big mistake.
kevin_malone Big mistake.
nellie_bertram Quite enormous.
phyllis_vance He's a real catch and you should take him back.
val Ok, thank you. Is that all?
nellie_bertram No. No, that is not all. Let me tell you what real life is like. The men dry up, and the nights get lonely. The only calls on your machine are for collection agencies about that pair of motorcycle boots you never even wore. You stalk your old high school boyfriend online, go to his daughter's soccer games, and make a scene. You buy a diamond ring for yourself, wear it on your right hand, and tell yourself, you're all you need. One day, you're alone, tired. At your feet, a dying bird. But where did it come from? Why did you kill it? Is it because in some strange way it is you?
val Thank you all for your concern, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, okay?
kevin_malone So does this mean you're gonna take Darryl back?
val No.
kevin_malone Well, then, what do you say to you and me hitting the town? 'Cause I'm free, literally forever.
val Yeah, Kevin asked me out. I was kinda feeling good about reentering the dating pool, but then Kevin asked me out. Thought I might trade up to a new level of man. Then Kevin asked me out.
pam_beesly Hello?
office_employee Hi, honey, it's mom. Look, Cece's school just called. She still has lice.
pam_beesly What, no. That can't...I don't...
office_employee Now, don't worry, don't worry. I'm on my way to pick her up, but you might have lice too. You know, lice can be tricky. Sometimes lice, like...
angela_martin Oh my God.
meredith_palmer Shave her head. Shave her head!
pam_beesly You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...
meredith_palmer Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
dwight_schrute She's right Pam.
pam_beesly Is there a volume knob on that thing?
dwight_schrute Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
pam_beesly Meredith, I am so sorry.
angela_martin Well, a lot of good your sorrys are doing her now, Pam. She's a monster.
pam_beesly I meant to say something earlier. I just...
meredith_palmer Just? Just what? Just forgot?
meredith_palmer Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
dwight_schrute Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...
erin_hannon Dwight, are you okay!?
dwight_schrute Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.
erin_hannon Wow. He got to purple.
oscar_martinez Ow!
angela_martin Sorry.
oscar_martinez You're waterboarding me!
angela_martin Oops.
kevin_malone No, this is fine. We are allowed to do this. This is okay.
erin_hannon You're up.
pete_miller Yeah, I'm kinda sad to see this baby go.
erin_hannon You do kinda look like Elvis, but we should probably wash all the dead lice out.
pete_miller Okay.
erin_hannon Okay. Okay. Is that too cold?
pete_miller No, it actually feels kinda nice.
kevin_malone I wonder what happened over there. I've been sitting here the whole time.
val Okay.
darryl_philbin Huh?
val Let's give it a shot. Let's make it work.
darryl_philbin Oh, no. I mean, I want to, I just...I don't want to force you into something you don't want to do.
val You're not. I believe in us.
darryl_philbin But...
darryl_philbin I'm back together with Val. Yay...
dwight_schrute I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere.
pete_miller Hey, did Erin already take off?
oscar_martinez I guess so.
pete_miller Okay.
julius_erving You're Kareem, coming to help.
jim_halpert Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
julius_erving And it went like this.
jim_halpert And that's all?
julius_erving That's it.
jim_halpert No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
julius_erving Yeah, you show me how.
jim_halpert This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.
pam_beesly Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.
meredith_palmer Hey, what you doing right now?
pam_beesly I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.
meredith_palmer Let her stay another hour. Let's go get a beer.
pam_beesly Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.
meredith_palmer No duh. Let's go. You're buying.
pam_beesly Meredith, I am so sorry about today.
meredith_palmer Forget about it.
pam_beesly I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.
meredith_palmer Right. I got the bartender's phone number when you were in the john. I'm gonna take that freak to bone town before the night is over.
pam_beesly Get it, girl!
pam_beesly This one's for all you ladies out there.
meredith_palmer I come...
pam_beesly Not yet.
all@ I come home in the middle of the night. My mother says when you gonna live your life right? Oh Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones. And girls, they want to have fun. Oh girls just want to have fun.
