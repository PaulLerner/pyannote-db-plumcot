michael_scott Dunder Mifflin is about to be sold. But first an investment banker has to drop by and sign off on our branch. And... I'm... pretty nervous about it. And... I'm... making some cosmetic tweaks to help create a more appealing environment. Is that dishonest? Well, think of it this way when you look in the mirror and you see your push-up bra and your fake eyelashes and your make-up and your press-on nails; the principles that I am applying to the office are the same ones that have made Lady Gaga a star... or any number of drag queens.
eric_ward Hi -
dwight_schrute Hello, Eric Ward. Welcome to Dunder Mifflin. I am Computron, your answer to everything.
eric_ward Hello.
michael_scott I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott What is the world's largest ocean?
dwight_schrute Calculating. Calculating. Pacific!
michael_scott Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
andy_bernard Great news, Michael. We're now the official paper supplier of the NFL.
michael_scott That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.
pam_beesly Hello.
dwight_schrute The NFL celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1972.
pam_beesly Hola. Bonjour. Ni Hao.
pam_beesly It might seem crazy, but since there's no one left in New York, Michael is Dunder Mifflin's highest ranking employee. So, that's where we are.
michael_scott Hello, Stanley.
fake_stanley Stanley Hi.
pam_beesly For the record? Not on board with fake Stanley... although, I get it.
eric_ward Uh, I just need to check out your warehouse and then talk to your HR guy. That is pretty much the only reason I'm here.
michael_scott Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -
eric_ward Right.
michael_scott - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
eric_ward Yeah.
michael_scott They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
dwight_schrute Mul Yam in Tel Aviv is better.
michael_scott No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
dwight_schrute Are you calling me wrong?
michael_scott Oh, my God.
eric_ward It's called 'due diligence'. Basically, I confirm inventory, take a head count, see if there are any HR liabilities. I'm a glorified fact checker. Actually, I am a fact checker.
michael_scott Alright. Excuse me. If you will -
ryan_howard Michael, do you think I could get a space heater -
michael_scott - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.
dwight_schrute Oh, we will. Have a seat.
michael_scott I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
eric_ward So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character.
dwight_schrute He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
toby_flenderson What are, are you doing at my desk?
dwight_schrute Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
toby_flenderson Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.
dwight_schrute Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. Welcome.
toby_flenderson Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson. Nice to meet you. How can I help?
eric_ward Um, are there any outstanding liability issues to be aware of?
toby_flenderson What do you mean?
eric_ward Well, safety issues, injuries that could leave the company open to potential lawsuits.
toby_flenderson Um... nothing comes to mind.
eric_ward So, the staff?
toby_flenderson Mm-hmm.
eric_ward Are people generally happy?
toby_flenderson Happy's a funny word.
eric_ward In what way?
toby_flenderson You know, uh, what does it mean to be happy. Keep philosophers busy for awhile.
eric_ward So... generally?
toby_flenderson Yes.
eric_ward Generally.
toby_flenderson Generally happy.
eric_ward Generally happy.
eric_ward What about non-safety issues, in terms of liability? Sexual harassment. Anything like that?
toby_flenderson Oh, I don't know.
eric_ward You, you don't know.
toby_flenderson I don't know.
eric_ward You're the head of Human Resources.
toby_flenderson I don't know. No.
eric_ward Ok.
toby_flenderson I don't know how I'm going to get through this. I don't want to lie and I DON'T want to tell the truth.
michael_scott Hey, Tobes. Whatcha doin'? Whatcha guys talkin' about?
toby_flenderson Well, Eric's just going over some stuff.
michael_scott Stuff. I love stuff.
toby_flenderson It's, uh, it's HR stuff.
michael_scott HR stuff? HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley. What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
eric_ward It's uh, it's a company evaluation form.
michael_scott Ah.
eric_ward Talkin' bout, uh -
michael_scott Talkin' bout, uh, what?
eric_ward Waste is next.
michael_scott Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
eric_ward No, waste of time and resources.
michael_scott Oh, time and resources.
toby_flenderson Look, you know, in any company there's going to be certain degrees -
michael_scott No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever.
eric_ward Is anyone near retirement age?
eric_ward Hey, uh, yeah, I finally got a chance to sit down with HR. So... well, I think I'm gonna be here for awhile.
michael_scott This is a building where friends become lovers and lovers become sexually interactive. Right? Would you agree with that?
toby_flenderson Michael, this is really inappropriate to talk about.
michael_scott That's, that is true.
dwight_schrute Thank you, so much.
kevin_malone Thank you.
angela_martin Thank you.
eric_ward Thank you. It's nice to meet you all.
pam_beesly Good to meet you.
angela_martin Have a great day.
dwight_schrute Hope to see you soon.
kevin_malone Yeah.
michael_scott I feel very sorry for that banker because he has to evaluate what we are worth. He has to decide what we are capable of and how do you do that? What is Jim capable of... or Pam... or Kevin?
michael_scott I don't care if he goes and files a report and says that we're nothing special because I think our future is very bright. We have only just begun.
dwight_schrute Computron experiencing emotion.
michael_scott Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
dwight_schrute Ok.
michael_scott Just - sh -
dwight_schrute Please don't. Computron -
michael_scott Shut -
dwight_schrute wants to live.
michael_scott Shut up. Shut up.
michael_scott Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
dwight_schrute Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.

michael_scott They call it Scranton!
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott The Electric City. Scranton!
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
dwight_schrute But check that it's covered by your

dwight_schrute But the little cars go in the compact spot!
