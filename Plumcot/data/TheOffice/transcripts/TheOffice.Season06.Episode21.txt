dwight_schrute Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
michael_scott How many is that?
dwight_schrute Not counting the last one, 25.
michael_scott Count the last one.
dwight_schrute Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
michael_scott Oh, new record!
dwight_schrute Okay.
michael_scott Oh, what did you do today?
jim_halpert I made a sale.
michael_scott Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
meredith_palmer What do we get if we do 'em?
michael_scott My respect. Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
dwight_schrute And one girl push-up.
michael_scott Gets to go home. Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. Disqualified!
angela_martin Ow!
michael_scott What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
creed_bratton Oh, come on!
jim_halpert 19. I had a really hard work out this morning.
michael_scott Oh, wow, that is adorable!
phyllis_vance Ten...
michael_scott Yeah, I'm betting one more.
phyllis_vance Eleven, wow!
michael_scott Good.
all@ Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley...
michael_scott Alright, alright.
oscar_martinez Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
michael_scott Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.
dwight_schrute 25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
phyllis_vance One more, one more!
oscar_martinez You okay? You okay, Stanley?
stanley_hudson Excuse me.
jim_halpert Wow.
oscar_martinez Hey. Matt, right?
matt Hey, Oscar. You're here early.
oscar_martinez I always come in at 7.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode21 Guy No, you don't.
oscar_martinez Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
matt I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know.
oscar_martinez Yeah.
oscar_martinez Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
darryl_philbin Hey, what's up?
oscar_martinez Hey, nice office.
darryl_philbin Thanks, it's cool. So...
oscar_martinez You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
darryl_philbin Has that ever happened? Ever?
oscar_martinez Didn't we? I think we did.
darryl_philbin You want me to invite Matt?
oscar_martinez Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
darryl_philbin Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
oscar_martinez So happy hour.
darryl_philbin Happy hour. My pleasure.
oscar_martinez All right.
oscar_martinez So what do you think?
phyllis_vance Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
phyllis_vance Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
andy_bernard A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
jim_halpert I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
andy_bernard Oh, baloney.
jim_halpert Good one.
andy_bernard Ring her up.
jim_halpert Absolutely, I will do that right now.
jim_halpert I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
jim_halpert So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
pam_beesly Yes! Yes! I would love to!
andy_bernard Ha! Knew it!
pam_beesly It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
jim_halpert I did not see this coming.
andy_bernard Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. Are you going later?
erin_hannon Sure, if you are.
andy_bernard Yes.
erin_hannon Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
andy_bernard Whoa.
andy_bernard We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um... but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
erin_hannon Exactly.
andy_bernard Yeah, cause when everyone knows- That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
erin_hannon Quiet.
andy_bernard Hey, boss man.
michael_scott Yes?
andy_bernard A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
michael_scott Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
andy_bernard I'm sorry, I meant later.
michael_scott Ok, yes. Sure.
andy_bernard For happy hour?
michael_scott No, I got that.
andy_bernard Trying to get a head count.
michael_scott I am in.
andy_bernard All right, yes! It's a deal.
michael_scott It's a deal.
pam_beesly Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly I want her to meet Michael.
jim_halpert Why?
pam_beesly They're both single, I have a sense they might-
jim_halpert You've been gone for a long time.
pam_beesly It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
kevin_malone Yeah!
pam_beesly Hey, how are you?
kevin_malone Oh, I missed you so much.
pam_beesly Aw!
kevin_malone Yeah!
pam_beesly Yeah!
kevin_malone Waaah!
kevin_malone When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
michael_scott Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God!
jim_halpert Easy.
michael_scott It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
jim_halpert Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
michael_scott Sucks to be you.
jim_halpert Would you like to be our fourth?
michael_scott That would be sublime.
jim_halpert All right.
darryl_philbin So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
pam_beesly Hey, Michael.
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly This is my friend Julie.
michael_scott Hello, how are you?
julie Good. Hi.
michael_scott What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?
pam_beesly Julie laughs at everything.
julie So you work with Pam and Jim?
michael_scott Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
julie I should hope not.
michael_scott No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
isabel_poreba Hey.
pam_beesly Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
isabel_poreba Of course.
pam_beesly You want to play pool?
isabel_poreba Um, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone.
pam_beesly Ok.
angela_martin And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
dwight_schrute Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
isabel_poreba Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
isabel_poreba A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
dwight_schrute Ooh, I love repartee.
isabel_poreba Do you?
dwight_schrute Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
michael_scott So, what do you do?
julie I am an ESL teacher.
michael_scott Really?
julie Yeah.
michael_scott See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
julie Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?'
michael_scott Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
julie I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done.
jim_halpert So what do you think?
michael_scott About what?
jim_halpert About Julie?
michael_scott She's nice.
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert So you like her?
michael_scott Uh, yeah, sure.
jim_halpert So Pam was right?
michael_scott About what?
jim_halpert About you two hitting it off.
michael_scott Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything.
hidetoshi_hasagawa My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart.
oscar_martinez I know.
pam_beesly Hey, Michael, where have you been?
jim_halpert Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
pam_beesly Why are you wearing a hat now?
michael_scott Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
michael_scott Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning?
jim_halpert You want to just make a run for it?
pam_beesly Maybe.
kevin_malone Waaaah! Waaaaah! Mommy!
jim_halpert What is happening?
andy_bernard Whoa! What is crackin?
ryan_howard Guys, one second.
kelly_kapoor We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
erin_hannon What's this game?
ryan_howard One second.
andy_bernard Yeah, how do you play?
ryan_howard Guys, guys, guys, please. Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
kelly_kapoor Only three tickets.
ryan_howard If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
kelly_kapoor Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
ryan_howard I know, but you wanted the big thing.
andy_bernard Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
erin_hannon Oh I know.
andy_bernard They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
erin_hannon 'Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
andy_bernard 'Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
erin_hannon Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
andy_bernard No drama. Ok.
isabel_poreba Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.
dwight_schrute Any brothers or sisters?
isabel_poreba Three brothers.
dwight_schrute Really?
isabel_poreba Two are in the Marines, one's a cop.
dwight_schrute Vegetarian?
isabel_poreba No. I love meat.
dwight_schrute What's your blood type?
isabel_poreba O-negative. Universal donor.
dwight_schrute Universal donor.
dwight_schrute Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
michael_scott Hey, guys, guys, guys. Watch this. Ready?
julie What are you doing?
michael_scott I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
jim_halpert Michael, you don't have to do this.
michael_scott Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
michael_scott I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
phyllis_vance Hey, you two having fun?
andy_bernard Did you tell them?
erin_hannon No.
andy_bernard This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
erin_hannon I get it.
isabel_poreba You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?
dwight_schrute Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
isabel_poreba Whack!
dwight_schrute Extend the fingers more.
isabel_poreba Whack!
dwight_schrute Good.
angela_martin This looks like a hoot.
dwight_schrute Hey, monkey, how you doing?
angela_martin Whack.
dwight_schrute Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
angela_martin Okay.
dwight_schrute Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
angela_martin It's no worry.
dwight_schrute It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
angela_martin I could see enjoying that.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
angela_martin But we signed the contract.
dwight_schrute Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
angela_martin We both-you didn't dup-
jim_halpert Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
pam_beesly Maybe it should come from a man.
jim_halpert Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
donna Manager Hello.
michael_scott Hello.
donna Manager Hi.
michael_scott Hi.
donna Manager You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?
michael_scott Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
pam_beesly Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
michael_scott Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.
donna Manager Ted, are we having fun?
michael_scott Really? You told on me. That's lame.
bouncer We got a problem?
michael_scott Yes. Homelessness. What?
donna Manager All right, go.
michael_scott Where?
donna Manager Get out. Now.
michael_scott Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
pam_beesly Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
michael_scott She can't talk to us that way.
pam_beesly You guys are stripes, I think...
michael_scott You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
jim_halpert It stopped.
michael_scott Well, I am starting it again!
pam_beesly Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
michael_scott Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
donna Manager Then I am sorry that I didn't kick you out.
michael_scott I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
donna Manager Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir.
michael_scott Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.
donna Manager Is that how you do it?
michael_scott Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
donna Manager Really? How much have you written?
michael_scott I've written all of it... in my head.
donna Manager Oh.
michael_scott If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
donna Manager Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca's? It's a classic.
michael_scott Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
donna Manager Dude, tonight! You're not going to want to put it down. It's gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow.
michael_scott I own a Chrysler.
donna Manager Shut up.
michael_scott No, you shut up.
donna Manager What's your drink?
michael_scott Grenadine.
donna Manager What?
andy_bernard We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
erin_hannon Okay.
andy_bernard Hi.
sales_analyst_playing_arcade_game at table Hi.
andy_bernard I don't normally do this, but...
sales_analyst_playing_arcade_game at table Do what?
andy_bernard Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
erin_hannon Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
andy_bernard What are you doing?
erin_hannon What we said to do.
andy_bernard We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
erin_hannon I was flirting with a man.
andy_bernard Get in here. Where did you learn to talk like that?
erin_hannon The movies. I don't know.
andy_bernard Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
michael_scott I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
donna Manager You have a card?
michael_scott I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
donna Manager Stanley Hudson?
michael_scott No, no.
donna Manager Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudson's in here.
michael_scott No, it's Michael Scott.
donna Manager Michael Scott?
michael_scott He is I.
donna Manager You just won yourself a lunch.
michael_scott Oh, hey guys.
julie I think I'm gonna go.
pam_beesly Really?
julie Yeah.
pam_beesly I'm sorry, he's not usually like that.
julie What's he usually like?
pam_beesly He's more, just... like... you can go.
julie Yeah.
jim_halpert All right.
pam_beesly Okay. Bye.
jim_halpert See ya. Nice girl.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott Hey, Julie! You having fun?
donna Manager So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? You're gonna want to come in on a day that I'm working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too.
darryl_philbin Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
oscar_martinez I couldn't understand a word he said.
darryl_philbin Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
oscar_martinez Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
matt Hey, what's up?
oscar_martinez There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
matt Anyone up for some hoops?
oscar_martinez Sure. Hoops!
matt Let's do it.
oscar_martinez Hoop it up, right.
andy_bernard This is not what I want my relationship to look like.
andy_bernard Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
andy_bernard You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
erin_hannon You love drama.
andy_bernard I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
dwight_schrute With this move, he can't get you.
isabel_poreba Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler.
dwight_schrute Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah!
angela_martin Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
dwight_schrute Sh-what?
angela_martin You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
dwight_schrute No, no, no. Blah blah blah blah!
angela_martin For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
isabel_poreba What are you talking about?
dwight_schrute What are you-
angela_martin Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
dwight_schrute Angela...
angela_martin Did he not tell you that?
dwight_schrute You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
angela_martin Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
dwight_schrute Angela, not here!
angela_martin Dwight?
isabel_poreba Whack!
angela_martin You'll see me in small claims court!
dwight_schrute You are an impressive specimen.
isabel_poreba Thank you.
kelly_kapoor Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
pam_beesly Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
jim_halpert You all right?
pam_beesly Okay, we have to get home.
kevin_malone Yeah!
michael_scott Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
jim_halpert Actually, you didn't.
pam_beesly Not at all.
michael_scott I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
darryl_philbin Tell 'em your story, Hide.
