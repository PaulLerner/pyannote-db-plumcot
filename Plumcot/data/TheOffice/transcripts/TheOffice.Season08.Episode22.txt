ryan_howard No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
pam_beesly Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
ryan_howard Smokey's dead.
pam_beesly Smokey, the bear?
ryan_howard Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
jim_halpert Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
ryan_howard Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
jim_halpert Well, I second that emotion.
ryan_howard Huh?
nellie_bertram I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
ryan_howard Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, "Tracks of my Tears"?
nellie_bertram Yeah
ryan_howard Um... God, so many, Nellie!
pam_beesly No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
ryan_howard Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
pam_beesly I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
ryan_howard Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
dwight_schrute You don't like the Beatles?
ryan_howard That's... That's not the point!
dwight_schrute Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
ryan_howard Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
oscar_martinez It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
ryan_howard Okay well, that's a relief!
jim_halpert Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
pam_beesly Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
jim_halpert Tickets are 250 bucks.
pam_beesly 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
ryan_howard Yeah... Who's opening?
jim_halpert Paul Anka.
ryan_howard Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
jim_halpert Okay, you could just show up late though.
ryan_howard How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
pam_beesly Tears of a clown!
ryan_howard Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
darryl_philbin Looking good, RC!
robert_california Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation s*x club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
angela_martin Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
angela_martin My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
dwight_schrute I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
jim_halpert Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
oscar_martinez What's going on?
dwight_schrute There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
erin_hannon Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
dwight_schrute That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops!
pam_beesly Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
phyllis_vance How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
dwight_schrute I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
nellie_bertram I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
andy_bernard Hey!
erin_hannon Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
angela_martin We think you might kill Robert.
andy_bernard What?
kevin_malone because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
andy_bernard guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
pam_beesly Oh, great! That sounds good!
kevin_malone Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
andy_bernard Why would that be weird?
kevin_malone It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
erin_hannon Andy's just coming as my date.
kevin_malone Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
nellie_bertram Come in!
darryl_philbin You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
nellie_bertram Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
darryl_philbin I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
nellie_bertram How are things in the warehouse?
darryl_philbin You could go downstairs and ask them?
nellie_bertram The warehouse isn't downstairs? Is it? Is it?
darryl_philbin Who knew, right?
nellie_bertram I...
nellie_bertram Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
angela_martin Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
andy_bernard Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
kevin_malone Oh man, this is weird!
robert_california Andrew.
andy_bernard Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! I had you, I had you!
andy_bernard Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
kevin_malone Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
creed_bratton Well, I don't want to get raped Twenty-Two!
kevin_malone No! It was my idea to not be raped!
dwight_schrute Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
kevin_malone Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
dwight_schrute You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
kevin_malone So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
andy_bernard What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
jim_halpert Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
andy_bernard The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
pam_beesly Sounds like you're doing alright.
andy_bernard Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
ryan_howard Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
state_senator_rob_lipton You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
oscar_martinez my dog Gerald is my life.
state_senator_rob_lipton really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me.
oscar_martinez This confirms three things I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
robert_california I stepped in right away and start--
andy_bernard Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
robert_california Well...
andy_bernard You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
robert_california So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
andy_bernard Evil! although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
robert_california and the hero, who's that based on?
andy_bernard Me, I guess. We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
meredith_palmer Hey jabroni. Show some class.
stanley_hudson She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
andy_bernard You're being a Thomas Oregon!
robert_california Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
andy_bernard Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
robert_california Andy you should leave. Now.
andy_bernard Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
waiter_2 I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.
andy_bernard then I'll take a table!
waiter_2 Okay
andy_bernard And a high five! Oh, let's do this again!
andy_bernard Oh, yes indeed... When! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! When!
oscar_martinez I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
pam_beesly Oh my god!
oscar_martinez I know!
jim_halpert Wait, what? Come on!
oscar_martinez We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
jim_halpert Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
oscar_martinez Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
jim_halpert Okay, what was this look?
pam_beesly Whoa!
jim_halpert What happened, did he do it?
pam_beesly Are you-- Twice! For real?
jim_halpert Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
pam_beesly Life is Downton Abbey.
jim_halpert Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
dwight_schrute How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
dwight_schrute It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
andy_bernard Hey... David Wallace!
david_wallace Andy Bernard!
andy_bernard Hey, how are you?
david_wallace How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
andy_bernard No, got canned last week.
david_wallace Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
andy_bernard No, best thing that ever happened to me.
david_wallace That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
andy_bernard Yikes!
david_wallace Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
nellie_bertram Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
darryl_philbin Tacos.
nellie_bertram What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
darryl_philbin I can go get us some tacos.
nellie_bertram Brilliant!
darryl_philbin If you loan me some money.
nellie_bertram Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
darryl_philbin $30.
nellie_bertram $30, yes!
nellie_bertram I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
oscar_martinez So?
jim_halpert Boom!
oscar_martinez This is interesting.
pam_beesly Hm-hmm.
jim_halpert what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
pam_beesly Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
oscar_martinez He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
pam_beesly Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
jim_halpert Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
volunteer_for_dogs_care Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California!
robert_california Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
andy_bernard can you believe this guy?
robert_california The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes!
andy_bernard Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
robert_california Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
andy_bernard I will! I will take all of those dogs!
robert_california Andy, that's very kind--
andy_bernard No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
robert_california Andy why don't we discuss this at a--
andy_bernard No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
erin_hannon Oh God!
state_senator_rob_lipton Mr. Bernard, right this way.
andy_bernard Okay! Hope you all learned something!
volunteer_for_dogs_care Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream.
andy_bernard I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
volunteer_for_dogs_care Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.
andy_bernard Stupid dog.
state_senator_rob_lipton Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number.
meredith_palmer Thank you!
pam_beesly Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
oscar_martinez sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
oscar_martinez No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
darryl_philbin Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
nellie_bertram Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!
darryl_philbin Hmhmm.
nellie_bertram Mmm! Uhh Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
darryl_philbin She's trying.
volunteer_for_dogs_care The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!
dwight_schrute Yes! Thank you!
volunteer_for_dogs_care The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!
dwight_schrute Oh yes! Yeah!
volunteer_for_dogs_care A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
dwight_schrute Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
volunteer_for_dogs_care Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!
dwight_schrute Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
volunteer_for_dogs_care Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars!
jim_halpert Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
dwight_schrute Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night!
state_senator_rob_lipton Oscar!
oscar_martinez Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
state_senator_rob_lipton It was lovely! And don't forget to call.
oscar_martinez okay
state_senator_rob_lipton thanks so much for coming
oscar_martinez why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
andy_bernard so it just goes on under here like this?
volunteer_for_dogs_care that's right!
andy_bernard Ugh, oh god!
volunteer_for_dogs_care Yeah, you never get used to that.
jim_halpert Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
andy_bernard I am so great!
erin_hannon He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
jim_halpert Look at that one though, he's smiling!
volunteer_for_dogs_care Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle.
andy_bernard This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
pam_beesly Absolutely, it's awesome--
jim_halpert Yes--
kevin_malone I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
andy_bernard You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
volunteer_for_dogs_care Maybe you would think it too! I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations.
jim_halpert Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
pam_beesly Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
andy_bernard Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
jim_halpert Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
andy_bernard Yeah, I do. I have that.
jim_halpert Yeah
erin_hannon You're going to be alright
kevin_malone No. No he's not.
andy_bernard Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
kevin_malone You're welcome!
kevin_malone Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
erin_hannon So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
darryl_philbin Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
kevin_malone My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
pam_beesly What do you feed her?
kevin_malone Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
darryl_philbin Is she sick? How are her poops?
kevin_malone Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
pam_beesly Does she smell?
kevin_malone She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
kevin_malone People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
