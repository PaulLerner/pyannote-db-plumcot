jim_halpert The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.
andy_bernard That's the other thing you got to watch out... Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
jim_halpert Yeah.
andy_bernard So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?
jim_halpert You know what? I think you just need to meet him.
andy_bernard Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.
jim_halpert Sounds good Andy.
karen_filippelli This is going to be an adventure.
jim_halpert Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?
karen_filippelli Right on. Hey is that Josh's computer?
andy_bernard What?
pam_beesly Hey!
toby_flenderson Hey.
pam_beesly How'd the run go?
toby_flenderson Ah, pretty good. I finished.
pam_beesly That's great!
dwight_schrute Psh, why is that great?
pam_beesly Because he accomplished something.
dwight_schrute What was your mile time?
toby_flenderson About seven.
dwight_schrute I could beat that on a skateboard.
toby_flenderson Well, that has wheels.
dwight_schrute Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
pam_beesly Really, Dwight? How fast are you?
dwight_schrute Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
pam_beesly Really?
dwight_schrute I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
dwight_schrute Man, what is taking Toby so long?
pam_beesly Oh, I'll just time him later.
dwight_schrute And you'll compare the times?
pam_beesly Yeah. Are you ready?
dwight_schrute No, my groin...
pam_beesly Set
dwight_schrute ...is really tight.
pam_beesly Go!
dwight_schrute I can't...
pam_beesly Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.
dwight_schrute Aaaaah!
pam_beesly I should probably get back to work.
michael_scott Here... Who's here?
dwight_schrute Nametag?
michael_scott Yes, please.
dwight_schrute Karen Filippelli.
michael_scott Karen Filip... Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
dwight_schrute Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus.
michael_scott Who's next?
dwight_schrute That's Andy Bernard.
michael_scott Andy Bernard.
dwight_schrute If I were you...
michael_scott Saint Bernard.
dwight_schrute ...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute ...before noon...
michael_scott I'm not...
dwight_schrute ...to consolidate power.
michael_scott I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
dwight_schrute No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
dwight_schrute The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
pam_beesly Good morning!
michael_scott Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
pam_beesly Okay.
pam_beesly Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.
hannah_smotridgebarr Hello?
michael_scott Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
dwight_schrute Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
michael_scott Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
michael_scott You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So... As far as I'm concerned, this says 'World's Best Dad'.
michael_scott Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?
tony_gardner Gardner.
michael_scott Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. Okay.
tony_gardner Thanks.
kevin_malone Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
michael_scott Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
hannah_smotridgebarr My bag's mostly pencils.
michael_scott Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
kevin_malone Can I have your pencils?
hannah_smotridgebarr No.
pam_beesly Hi!
karen_filippelli Hi.
pam_beesly I'm Pam.
karen_filippelli Karen. I love your sweater.
pam_beesly Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.
karen_filippelli Really? That's so cool. I've always wanted to learn...
michael_scott Welcome.
karen_filippelli ...to knit.
michael_scott Welcome, welcome, welcome! Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
karen_filippelli Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
michael_scott Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
andy_bernard I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
andy_bernard Hello.
michael_scott Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
andy_bernard And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.
michael_scott A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
andy_bernard Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.
michael_scott Oh.
andy_bernard Nifty!
michael_scott They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
michael_scott You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.
martin ...which is why they need a passing game.
jim_halpert Right.
michael_scott No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
martin Oh! Thanks.
michael_scott Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. Not... so, your desk is...
jim_halpert Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
pam_beesly Oh my god! It's really you!
jim_halpert Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...
pam_beesly I know. I don't care.
jim_halpert Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
pam_beesly It's really good to see you.
jim_halpert You, too.
jim_halpert Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.
dwight_schrute Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
jim_halpert Okay. Sounds good.
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
jim_halpert I don't know what you're talking about.
dwight_schrute I have a smudge on my forehead?
jim_halpert No. Looks good.
dwight_schrute Why are you looking at my forehead?
jim_halpert I'm not.
dwight_schrute Meet my eye line, Jim!
jim_halpert I am.
dwight_schrute Stop acting like an idiot!
jim_halpert Okay.
ryan_howard Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
jim_halpert Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
ryan_howard I'm good! How are you? So...
jim_halpert Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?
ryan_howard Yeah.
jim_halpert Oh.
ryan_howard Um... unless you really, really want it back.
jim_halpert You know, man, it's really you're call.
ryan_howard Cool, thank you.
jim_halpert Let me get that for you.
ryan_howard Yuh.
jim_halpert This one taken? No. Good.
ryan_howard Yeah. Jim is a nice guy. That's why I got the desk.
toby_flenderson Hey, this came with the Stamford book. Can you take care of it?
kevin_malone Oh, yes I can.
kevin_malone In general, they do not give me much responsibility. But they do let me shred the company documents. And that is really all I need.
andy_bernard Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.
michael_scott Right.
dwight_schrute Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
andy_bernard Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.
dwight_schrute So you'll be reporting to me, then.
andy_bernard Umm, on the contrary.
dwight_schrute My title has 'Manager' in it.
andy_bernard And I'm a director.
dwight_schrute Oh.
andy_bernard Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?
dwight_schrute I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
andy_bernard Congratulations.
jim_halpert Hey, Toby!
toby_flenderson Hey, Jim!
jim_halpert How are you, man?
toby_flenderson Oh, really good.
jim_halpert I just wanted to say hi.
toby_flenderson How are you? Hey. Welcome back.
jim_halpert Oh. Is that like your new thing?
toby_flenderson No, I'm sorry, it's...
jim_halpert No. It's cool.
toby_flenderson No, it's nothing. We'll just...
jim_halpert All right. Good to be back.
toby_flenderson So... okay.
jim_halpert All right.
toby_flenderson All right... sorry... sorry about that.
jim_halpert No problem.
toby_flenderson It was just...
jim_halpert ...what?
toby_flenderson Nothing.
kevin_malone This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! Shoot.
michael_scott I present the orientation video.
dwight_schrute We need to talk!
michael_scott Not now.
dwight_schrute Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
michael_scott I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
dwight_schrute Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
michael_scott It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
dwight_schrute Ok. Who reports to who?
michael_scott I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
dwight_schrute And then if I want...
michael_scott Work it out amongst your selves!
dwight_schrute I...
michael_scott Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
dwight_schrute I...
michael_scott Will you?
dwight_schrute One...
michael_scott Please?
kelly_kapoor Jim!
jim_halpert Kelly!
kelly_kapoor Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!
jim_halpert Really?
kelly_kapoor Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!
jim_halpert Great. What's new with you?
kelly_kapoor I just told you.
michael_scott Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!
michael_scott Yoko shack.
Male#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode08 voice ...thank you James.
meredith_palmer Hey, champagne.
michael_scott Nope, no. Guests only.
kelly_kapoor Looks like salmon.
michael_scott Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
kelly_kapoor I eat beef.
michael_scott Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
kevin_malone The beef is poisoned?
michael_scott No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. Welcome. Help yourself.
toby_flenderson Um... You might want these orientation materials.
michael_scott Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
jim_halpert Oh, this looks promising.
pam_beesly You won't be disappointed.
michael_scott Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
Video#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode08
michael_scott Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
dwight_schrute Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
michael_scott So check out how we live
michael_scott & Dwight in the Electric City!
michael_scott They call it Scranton.
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott The Electric City. Scranton.
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
dwight_schrute But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
jim_halpert It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
michael_scott I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.
Video#unknown#TheOffice.Season03.Episode08
michael_scott You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
dwight_schrute But the little cars go in the compact spot
michael_scott and Dwight Spot, spot, spot, spot ...
michael_scott Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?
michael_scott Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.
karen_filippelli This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
jim_halpert Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
karen_filippelli This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.
jim_halpert Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
karen_filippelli Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.
jim_halpert You feel good?
karen_filippelli Mm-hm.
jim_halpert All right.
karen_filippelli Karen Filippelli.
andy_bernard Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?
dwight_schrute Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
andy_bernard Sure thing, buddy.
andy_bernard Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.
andy_bernard Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.
angela_martin Oh.
andy_bernard Do you like it?
angela_martin I do like it, actually.
andy_bernard Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.
angela_martin Thank you.
andy_bernard You're welcome.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey!
pam_beesly What happened to grape soda?
jim_halpert Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.
pam_beesly Oh. You've changed so much.
jim_halpert Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
pam_beesly So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
jim_halpert Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
pam_beesly Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
jim_halpert Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...
michael_scott All right.
jim_halpert Don't...
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert All right. I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
pam_beesly Yeah. I know, me too.
jim_halpert All right!
pam_beesly The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.
hannah_smotridgebarr Take a picture. It'll last longer.
ryan_howard I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.
creed_bratton Ditto that, my brother.
hannah_smotridgebarr Look what's on his computer.
michael_scott What is that? A squid's eye or...
hannah_smotridgebarr It's my left breast.
michael_scott How did you...
creed_bratton Right place at the right time.
karen_filippelli Uh, what's that smell?
phyllis_vance What smell?
karen_filippelli Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.
phyllis_vance Oh, I'll help you find it.
karen_filippelli Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.
phyllis_vance What is it?
karen_filippelli I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.
phyllis_vance My perfume?
karen_filippelli It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.
phyllis_vance Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
karen_filippelli Who's Bob Vance?
phyllis_vance You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
stanley_hudson I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.
michael_scott People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
michael_scott I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
dwight_schrute Do you have batteries?
michael_scott Ssshh stupid! Um...
andy_bernard
michael_scott That's it!
andy_bernard What is love?
michael_scott Yes, yes! Okay!
andy_bernard Baby, don't hurt me.
michael_scott Okay, here we go.
andy_bernard & Michael Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!
michael_scott Oh!
andy_bernard Baby, don't hurt me!
michael_scott Oh! Oh! Oh!
andy_bernard Whoa-oh-oh-oh
michael_scott Scuse me! Scuse me!
andy_bernard & Michael Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...
michael_scott You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
andy_bernard Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
michael_scott You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
andy_bernard Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.
michael_scott Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
dwight_schrute Very funny, Michael!
michael_scott Okay! Okay!
dwight_schrute Really funny, Michael!
michael_scott All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
michael_scott Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.
karen_filippelli Shouldn't we be equals?
michael_scott Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
tony_gardner Uh... this is difficult, for me.
michael_scott I understand. We're all friends.
tony_gardner No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.
michael_scott Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
tony_gardner
michael_scott You know what? I'll help. I will...
tony_gardner No, please. No.
michael_scott Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
dwight_schrute Do this. Come on. Ready?
michael_scott Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
dwight_schrute On three. One... two... three.
michael_scott Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
tony_gardner All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.
michael_scott We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
tony_gardner Let me go!
michael_scott I'm right in your crack!
tony_gardner Put me down right...
michael_scott Up and over.
tony_gardner Put me down!
michael_scott Up and over.
tony_gardner Put me down right now!
michael_scott You've got it.
tony_gardner I'VE HAD ENOUGH!
michael_scott You've got it, you've got it.
tony_gardner PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!
michael_scott Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
dwight_schrute Hey, hey. Easy.
michael_scott Easy.
tony_gardner I'm sorry!
michael_scott Don't...
tony_gardner It's just not going to work for me.
michael_scott What...
tony_gardner I have to go.
michael_scott I don't understand.
tony_gardner I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.
michael_scott Well, we'll squeeze you in.
tony_gardner I can't work here. I have to quit.
michael_scott You can't quit! On the first day. That's heresy, my friend! Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?
tony_gardner No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.
michael_scott My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
tony_gardner No. Was it supposed to be funny?
michael_scott Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
tony_gardner Excuse me?
michael_scott You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
tony_gardner But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.
michael_scott Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
dwight_schrute That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
michael_scott Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
dwight_schrute And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
andy_bernard Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.
hannah_smotridgebarr Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.
angela_martin Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.
michael_scott Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
stanley_hudson Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.
michael_scott No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
michael_scott The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.
michael_scott Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.
dwight_schrute What!
michael_scott Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
karen_filippelli Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?
jim_halpert Does he ever.
michael_scott Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.
dwight_schrute YEAH!
michael_scott Yeah.
toby_flenderson I don't... I don't think we can do that.
michael_scott Go home, Toby. Just...
martin Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?
michael_scott Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
hannah_smotridgebarr For crying out loud.
michael_scott No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
martin What's up with this guy?
stanley_hudson Got an hour? I'll try to explain.
michael_scott THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
stanley_hudson Trust me. It only gets worse.
martin Is he always like this?
ryan_howard Sometimes he brings more costumes.
hannah_smotridgebarr When do people work?
phyllis_vance Oh, we find little times during the day.
karen_filippelli How are we going to get home?
phyllis_vance Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.
karen_filippelli Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.
michael_scott See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. Jell-o!
jan_levinson Michael!
michael_scott Hi, Jan!
jan_levinson Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?
michael_scott I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
jan_levinson Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?
michael_scott Yes.
jan_levinson You do?
michael_scott But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
jan_levinson What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.
michael_scott What?
jan_levinson He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.
michael_scott Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
michael_scott So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.
dwight_schrute If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
jim_halpert Yeah, it does, actually.
dwight_schrute So who will be your new Number Three?
michael_scott Uh... that I have not decided yet.
andy_bernard Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.
michael_scott Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
dwight_schrute And I have to say your leadership...
michael_scott Shut it...
dwight_schrute has brought...
michael_scott Shut it! That's... suck up!
jim_halpert Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?
karen_filippelli I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
jim_halpert What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?
karen_filippelli Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
jim_halpert Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?
karen_filippelli Yeah.
jim_halpert Ok, thanks.
karen_filippelli Ok.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Hey!
jim_halpert I thought you had already... left.
pam_beesly Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.
jim_halpert Oh... Good.
pam_beesly What's up?
jim_halpert Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.
pam_beesly What do you mean?
jim_halpert I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...
pam_beesly Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.
jim_halpert O..ok. Um..good.
pam_beesly We're friends. We'll always be friends.
jim_halpert Right.
pam_beesly It's good to have you back.
jim_halpert Yeah. Good to be back.
meredith_palmer Where'd you get that salad?
kevin_malone Staples.
andy_bernard Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?
dwight_schrute Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
andy_bernard Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.
dwight_schrute Xterra's not even a real word.
andy_bernard Actually, it is. It's Latin for "earth."
dwight_schrute Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
andy_bernard Yeah.
dwight_schrute That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
andy_bernard Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
dwight_schrute Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
andy_bernard Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.
dwight_schrute Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
andy_bernard Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
dwight_schrute Idiot!
andy_bernard If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
dwight_schrute If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
andy_bernard Idiot!
dwight_schrute You're the idiot!
andy_bernard Nice comeback!
dwight_schrute I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. Totally got the best of that interchange.
