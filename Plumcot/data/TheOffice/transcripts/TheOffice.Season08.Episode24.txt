oscar_martinez Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
phyllis_vance What's he doing?
dwight_schrute He's searching out younger gays.
phyllis_vance Oh.
oscar_martinez No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
dwight_schrute ...with you.
oscar_martinez No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
kelly_kapoor Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
oscar_martinez Do you not own a mirror?
kelly_kapoor Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
pam_beesly I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
kelly_kapoor I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
oscar_martinez Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
robert_california No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
oscar_martinez It's not misleading.
robert_california -pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as "normal." It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
kevin_malone Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. Ooh!
robert_california Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!
dwight_schrute You okay, Robert?
robert_california Fine.
dwight_schrute Put some ice on it.
oscar_martinez In any case, it gets better. Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
sasha_flenderson One, two, three!
dwight_schrute I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, "muffin basket." Then I thought, "What's even more precious to people than muffins?"
jake_palmer Can you just smile, please?
meredith_palmer I don't want to!
dwight_schrute ...their own children.
dwight_schrute Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
angela_martin No thank you.
dwight_schrute Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
jim_halpert I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
jim_halpert Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
dwight_schrute Wha-? Damn it, Jim!
jim_halpert Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
darryl_philbin Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
hidetoshi_hasagawa Bad economy. Bad investment.
darryl_philbin You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
calvin They did not.
darryl_philbin And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
calvin I wouldn't.
darryl_philbin Aw, come on. What's the harm? Mmm. What flavor was that?
hidetoshi_hasagawa Coconut pen1s.
darryl_philbin The coconut's pretty subtle.
calvin Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no?
darryl_philbin I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- ooh, hold on a second. Oh.
darryl_philbin If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
andy_bernard Hi guys.
jim_halpert How's it going, man?
andy_bernard I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
jim_halpert Great, yeah, good.
gabe_lewis Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
nellie_bertram Oh God.
andy_bernard Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
nellie_bertram No, you don't understand-
andy_bernard Clean the toilets.
nellie_bertram I don't need anyone to-
andy_bernard Pull the poop out of the toilets.
nellie_bertram That's not even a thing.
andy_bernard Just, please...
nellie_bertram Andy.
andy_bernard Please!
nellie_bertram Andy.
andy_bernard Give me something!
nellie_bertram Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
andy_bernard Thank you.
nellie_bertram You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
andy_bernard Thank you.
nellie_bertram You don't need to-
andy_bernard I have a delicious secret.
creed_bratton Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
jim_halpert Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
andy_bernard Yeah, it is actually.
andy_bernard Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
pam_beesly Family picture!
jim_halpert Pam? No!
pam_beesly What? Honey, we talked about this.
jim_halpert No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
pam_beesly Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
jim_halpert No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
pam_beesly No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
jim_halpert Nope.
pam_beesly We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
jim_halpert But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
pam_beesly No, no.
jim_halpert Nope.
pam_beesly But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
jim_halpert That's-
pam_beesly Yes!
jim_halpert That's-
pam_beesly And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
jim_halpert Okay.
kevin_malone Wait, C-R-A-Z...
dwight_schrute Great, right up there.
pam_beesly Yeah?
jim_halpert Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Alright. Why don't you just-
pam_beesly Oh, great. Thank you.
jim_halpert -give him to me and... perfect.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert This is great.
pam_beesly You ready?
jim_halpert Excuse me.
pam_beesly There we go.
jim_halpert Just do it.
pam_beesly I'll just stand here?
jim_halpert Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
photographer_toni Sir, could you look into the camera?
jim_halpert Let's do it, shoot it.
photographer_toni Sir.
jim_halpert Great.
dwight_schrute Up here.
jim_halpert Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
dwight_schrute Jim, right here, right here. Okay, good.
jim_halpert Oh, so that's it?
dwight_schrute That's it.
pam_beesly See? That wasn't so hard.
dwight_schrute Cute kids, thanks for coming.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody.
angela_martin Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op.
phyllis_vance Yeah.
angela_martin Heh.
erin_hannon Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Thanks.
dwight_schrute Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
angela_martin Dwight.
dwight_schrute Nice to see you. May I hold him?
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Sure.
angela_martin No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
angela_martin I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
angela_martin See the duckie!
dwight_schrute Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Oh, thank you.
angela_martin No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
dwight_schrute Really?
andy_bernard This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. It's go time.
andy_bernard Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
nellie_bertram Well, I don't want any soup.
andy_bernard But it's really good- Oh!
nellie_bertram Oh come on, Andy!
erin_hannon I know this is going to be a great payoff.
andy_bernard A delicious moment.
erin_hannon But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
andy_bernard Well, but it-
erin_hannon Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
dwight_schrute Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
angela_martin Uh-uh, leave us alone.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton I guess we're okay with the fingernails.
dwight_schrute Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
angela_martin Dwight, we're fine!
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?
angela_martin Oh no.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
dwight_schrute He defecated, aw.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton You're stinky.
darryl_philbin A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
brandon That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that.
val Uh, Brandon?
darryl_philbin I would.
brandon You would?
darryl_philbin Yeah.
brandon Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend.
val Calm down, he's not.
darryl_philbin Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
brandon So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
val Brandon!
darryl_philbin Good slam.
brandon Thank you, Biggie.
darryl_philbin Good luck to you.
brandon Oh, and have a burger for me.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Okay, shall we take a few more?
angela_martin I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Okay. There we go.
angela_martin No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
dwight_schrute Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
toby_flenderson Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
nellie_bertram You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
andy_bernard I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
jim_halpert No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
erin_hannon No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
nellie_bertram What?
pam_beesly You hit her?
andy_bernard No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
erin_hannon He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
andy_bernard That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
gabe_lewis Happy birthday to Gabe!
nellie_bertram Oh, get out, skeleton man!
toby_flenderson I can refer you to someone to talk to.
andy_bernard Huh? Hold on.
toby_flenderson Give you a name or-
andy_bernard I just gonna- quick- Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
jim_halpert Oh boy.
pam_beesly Oh, Andy.
oscar_martinez What?
andy_bernard I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
oscar_martinez David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
andy_bernard Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum "Suck It" to the U.S. military.
jim_halpert Andy, come on.
kevin_malone Even I know that's weird.
andy_bernard I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
toby_flenderson Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
andy_bernard Stop saying my name.
erin_hannon No, he's not making this up.
andy_bernard Thank you, Erin.
erin_hannon Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
pam_beesly But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
erin_hannon Oh my God.
andy_bernard Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
toby_flenderson Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
dwight_schrute Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
kelly_kapoor Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
ravi I do adore you.
robert_california Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this.
andy_bernard Yeah, I know.
robert_california Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.
jim_halpert Hey.
all@ Hey!
david_wallace Hey guys, long time.
pam_beesly David, what are you doing here?
phyllis_vance Is it true you're buying the company?
david_wallace Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
andy_bernard What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
david_wallace I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
andy_bernard But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
david_wallace Yes, as we've discussed-
andy_bernard What?
david_wallace But it's very possible-
andy_bernard Oh my God!
david_wallace Probable.
andy_bernard Wow. From janitor to manager?
david_wallace Yep.
andy_bernard That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
david_wallace There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
andy_bernard From total loss to total boss, I mean-
stanley_hudson Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
david_wallace Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
andy_bernard I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
phyllis_vance So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
david_wallace Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
robert_california Oof. Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. I'm actually the CEO.
david_wallace Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
robert_california Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.
david_wallace Well, okay. Great to meet you.
robert_california Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis.
david_wallace Pleasure.
robert_california I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
david_wallace That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
robert_california Please.
andy_bernard Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
jim_halpert Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
andy_bernard Gosh, I hope so.
angela_martin No! God, Mose! God!
mose Hi, Angela.
angela_martin Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
mose I'm not supposed to say.
angela_martin Yes! Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
darryl_philbin Let's see that smile. Go on.
val Right here?
darryl_philbin Cool.
andy_bernard Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
nellie_bertram May I say one thing?
andy_bernard It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
nellie_bertram The quality of mercy is not strained.
andy_bernard No.
nellie_bertram It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
andy_bernard Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
nellie_bertram It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
andy_bernard I just want one mother delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
andy_bernard If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
nellie_bertram Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
andy_bernard All right, you sly b*st*rd. When can you start?
david_wallace Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
meredith_palmer Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
david_wallace But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
robert_california David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
david_wallace I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
robert_california Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
andy_bernard Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
robert_california Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.
andy_bernard Mm. Mm-hmm.
robert_california It's been a great year.
dwight_schrute Hello.
angela_martin Where is it?
dwight_schrute They're testing it now.
angela_martin How long does it take to get the results?
dwight_schrute Seventy-two hours.
angela_martin You're gonna wait here?
dwight_schrute Yes.
angela_martin Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton Hey.
oscar_martinez Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton You didn't call.
oscar_martinez Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
state_senator_rob_lipton Lipton You know what this is about. Call.
