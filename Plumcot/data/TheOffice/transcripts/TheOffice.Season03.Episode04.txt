michael_scott Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?
ryan_howard Uh, no thanks, I'm good.
michael_scott Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.
ryan_howard Um... Yeah, absolutely.
michael_scott All right, I'll be right back.
dwight_schrute Whoo!
michael_scott There you go.
dwight_schrute Awesome!
ryan_howard Thank you.
michael_scott You're welcome.
dwight_schrute Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
michael_scott Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.
dwight_schrute Okay. Whoo!
michael_scott There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
pam_beesly Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
michael_scott There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
pam_beesly But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.
ryan_howard and others Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great.
michael_scott All right. Okay.
michael_scott I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.
pam_beesly With cream and sugar?
michael_scott All right.
jan_levinson So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
michael_scott Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?
jan_levinson Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
michael_scott Oh, wow.
michael_scott Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died.
kelly_kapoor Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad.
michael_scott Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.
phyllis_vance That's a shame. Ed was a good guy.
michael_scott That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up.
michael_scott So did you hear the news?
pam_beesly The news that you just announced? That Ed died?
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly Is there anything I can do?
michael_scott Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott
pam_beesly Oh. Okay.
michael_scott Yeah. Mmmmmm.
pam_beesly Okay.
josh_porter What's going on with Fairfield County schools? Karen, did you generate that price list?
karen_filippelli Um, shoot. Uh, I will. Sorry.
josh_porter Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure?
jim_halpert Oh yeah, definitely.
andy_bernard Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said?
josh_porter Thank you, everyone.
karen_filippelli Dammit.
jim_halpert What's up?
karen_filippelli Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips.
jim_halpert Oh.
karen_filippelli But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
jim_halpert Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please.
creed_bratton It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
michael_scott Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.
creed_bratton About what?
michael_scott The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.
creed_bratton Ed was decapitated.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute Really?
creed_bratton He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off.
michael_scott Oh my God.
dwight_schrute That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.
creed_bratton You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
dwight_schrute You're thinking of a chicken.
creed_bratton What did I say?
michael_scott That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
michael_scott So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
dwight_schrute Ed was decapitated.
michael_scott What are you doing?
dwight_schrute You said you didn't know how to say it.
michael_scott I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
dwight_schrute Hey.
angela_martin Hi.
dwight_schrute If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
angela_martin I do not wanna talk about this.
dwight_schrute When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
michael_scott I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.
jan_levinson I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
michael_scott You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
jan_levinson Well, what would you suggest?
michael_scott A statue.
jan_levinson Of Ed?
michael_scott Yeah.
jan_levinson I'm not sure that's realistic.
michael_scott Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
jan_levinson No, that's not---
michael_scott We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
dwight_schrute That is not a statue, that is a robot.
michael_scott I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
dwight_schrute And how big do you want this robot?
michael_scott Life-size.
dwight_schrute Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.
jan_levinson What the hell are you two talking about?
michael_scott Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
jan_levinson You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today...
michael_scott Mm hm.
jan_levinson ...and I have to get back to work.
michael_scott Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
jan_levinson So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
michael_scott But Ed truck can't because he is---
jan_levinson Goodbye.
michael_scott DEAD.
dwight_schrute Look I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
michael_scott That's perfect.
jim_halpert Okay, that is a "no" on the on the West Side Market.
karen_filippelli Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now?
jim_halpert Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter.
karen_filippelli I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want.
jim_halpert Really?
karen_filippelli Yeah, all day.
andy_bernard Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.
jim_halpert Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
andy_bernard Did you check the vending machine?
karen_filippelli Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that?
jim_halpert I have no idea. We went right for the copier.
karen_filippelli Mm.
jim_halpert And then we checked the fax machine.
karen_filippelli Yeah, nothing there.
andy_bernard Did you check your... butt?
michael_scott Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.
phyllis_vance Okay that's enough.
michael_scott What?
stanley_hudson We do not wanna hear about this.
michael_scott Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!
stanley_hudson You have just spit on my face.
michael_scott Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
michael_scott There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.
michael_scott I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.
roy_anderson Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
michael_scott Okay, fine. Hurry back.
roy_anderson There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the "grief counseling" session.
pam_beesly Oh. I would like a break.
roy_anderson How are you likin' the new car?
pam_beesly Great.
roy_anderson Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags?
pam_beesly I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
roy_anderson Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah.
jim_halpert Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back. Shut up .
karen_filippelli Six?
michael_scott Okay, we can start. Um...
pam_beesly You waited for me?
michael_scott Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
dwight_schrute I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
michael_scott Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.
stanley_hudson Nope.
michael_scott Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.
stanley_hudson I will NOT.
michael_scott Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
pam_beesly Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
michael_scott Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.
ryan_howard Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
michael_scott Do you want to talk about it anymore?
ryan_howard Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
kevin_malone Me, me, me, me, me me. Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so...
michael_scott Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. Do you think that this is a game?
phyllis_vance Well, there is a ball.
michael_scott All right, we're starting over.
stanley_hudson No, I'm done.
michael_scott You are not leaving. No! We are not done.
angela_martin We really have a lot of work to do right now.
michael_scott Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk.
toby_flenderson Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going.
michael_scott How do you know?
toby_flenderson What?
michael_scott That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?
toby_flenderson It was obvious...
michael_scott Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!
dwight_schrute Michael! Michael. Michael ...
michael_scott Oh, God!
dwight_schrute Oh...
michael_scott Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...
dwight_schrute Poor little fella.
michael_scott Oh shhhh--oot!
dwight_schrute He is a goner.
michael_scott No, he's not.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
michael_scott No, he's not.
dwight_schrute Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!
michael_scott Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!
angela_martin A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
michael_scott We don't know if it's dead.
kelly_kapoor Ugh, no that thing is dead.
dwight_schrute You want me to flush him?
michael_scott Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
meredith_palmer I have a lot of work to do.
michael_scott Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.
angela_martin But...
michael_scott No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. Find a box for him.
karen_filippelli I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
jim_halpert Nice!
karen_filippelli Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah... merci quand meme. Au revoir.
jim_halpert Sounded good.
karen_filippelli Thanks.
kelly_kapoor
michael_scott It's okay. It's okay. Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.
kelly_kapoor I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight?
dwight_schrute Argh... gah!
michael_scott What are... What are you doing?
dwight_schrute What? No, this is about the right size.
michael_scott No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?
dwight_schrute I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
dwight_schrute I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.
pam_beesly Is it for the bird?
dwight_schrute Yeah.
pam_beesly I have it covered.
dwight_schrute Oh, thank you.
pam_beesly If you wanna do something for the funeral...
dwight_schrute Yes, please.
pam_beesly Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
dwight_schrute Excellent.
pam_beesly Do you have it with you?
dwight_schrute Always.
pam_beesly Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.
karen_filippelli Where'd you find them?
jim_halpert Where'd I find what?
jim_halpert I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
michael_scott Glad you could all make it.
kelly_kapoor You told us we had to.
michael_scott Dwight, do you have the box?
pam_beesly Actually, I have it.
michael_scott You made this? Wow. That's... that's very nice.
ryan_howard When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking "I'm a little too old for this." And I was five.
pam_beesly I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much. It's just a bird." But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
kevin_malone Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny.
pam_beesly And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
dwight_schrute He's not a songbird.
michael_scott Shhh.
pam_beesly An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten.
angela_martin Amen.
dwight_schrute
pam_beesly Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
michael_scott Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
dwight_schrute Let's get back to work.
