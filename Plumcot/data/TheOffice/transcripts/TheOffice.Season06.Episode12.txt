andy_bernard You wanted to see me?
michael_scott Yeah, Have a seat.
andy_bernard Is it serious? Wow. Andy's a wittle scared.
michael_scott Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
andy_bernard Why would people say that?
michael_scott I have it on good authority that you said the following. Can you read that back to me?
andy_bernard Andy have a boo-boo tummy.
michael_scott Mmm-hmm.
andy_bernard Would you rather me say "Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?"
michael_scott Okay.
andy_bernard "Crazy diarrhea happening right now?" Cause things can get real adult real fast.
michael_scott You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand."
andy_bernard Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes. Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across? Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.
michael_scott You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies.
andy_bernard Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
michael_scott Okay, who said that?
andy_bernard I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.
michael_scott Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.
andy_bernard Tank you Mr. Elwis.
michael_scott You're welcome, baby.
andy_bernard Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
jim_halpert Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
andy_bernard The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.
jim_halpert Wow, what do you put our chances at?
andy_bernard 0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!
jim_halpert Hmm, sounds risky.
andy_bernard Don't worry. There is a surefire cure. Employee of the Month. Every awesome place I've worked has had one.
andy_bernard Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.
jim_halpert Wow, that's not such a bad idea.
andy_bernard Great!
jim_halpert Anything else?
andy_bernard Nope!
erin_hannon Frankie's Dirty Joke of the Day? There's a bunch of those.
michael_scott Keep.
erin_hannon There's a bunch of Sent e-mails that jusy say "Delivered." Should I delete all of those?
michael_scott I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
erin_hannon That's why you have a "Sent Mail" folder.
michael_scott Keep.
erin_hannon There's about 30 news alerts for "Nip Slip."
michael_scott For what?
erin_hannon "Nip slip."
michael_scott Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there...
erin_hannon Well...
michael_scott Must be hackers.
jim_halpert Hey. What's up?
michael_scott What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
jim_halpert Did you murder someone?
michael_scott Worse than that.
erin_hannon Oh, my God.
michael_scott Lurk much? I miss Pam.
jim_halpert I think she's okay.
michael_scott Is that what we're going for now? "okay?" We used to go for "pretty good."
jim_halpert Great. Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
michael_scott Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but...
jim_halpert You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
michael_scott Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
jim_halpert It would look bad. Sorry.
michael_scott It would look good, on my mantle.
andy_bernard Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea!
dwight_schrute Yeah! Your idea.
dwight_schrute My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired.
erin_hannon Hey Pam, do you have a sec to check over this inventory?
pam_beesly Looks great.
erin_hannon Oh, did you really look it over? Felt like maybe you didn't.
pam_beesly Okay. The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?
michael_scott There you are. I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
phyllis_vance What's "Scott's Tots?"
stanley_hudson Has it really been ten years?
stanley_hudson "Local businessman pledges college tuition to third graders"
pam_beesly Michael, why did you promise that?
michael_scott To change lives.
pam_beesly No Michael, why would you promise that?
michael_scott Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can't go through with this.
erin_hannon We've already rescheduled seven times.
pam_beesly Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.
michael_scott Well...
pam_beesly It's terrible.
michael_scott No.
pam_beesly Just terrible. And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.
michael_scott I just, I fell in love with those kids. and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise. I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education. I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.
michael_scott Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?
pam_beesly No!
michael_scott I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right.
pam_beesly You have to tell them.
michael_scott Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of...
erin_hannon I can print out a new itinerary with Pam's name on it.
pam_beesly It's fine. Erin, you're going to go. And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.
michael_scott Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
dwight_schrute Hey Jimmy, what's up?
jim_halpert Not much.
dwight_schrute Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
jim_halpert Thanks Dwight.
dwight_schrute That laugh is so infectious.
jim_halpert You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.
dwight_schrute I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work.
jim_halpert Let me guess, you think you should get it.
dwight_schrute This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
jim_halpert Well, in an ideal world...
dwight_schrute In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
jim_halpert Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense."
dwight_schrute I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
jim_halpert That's okay, I'll do it.
mikela_lasker Mr. Scott?
michael_scott Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?
mikela_lasker I'm good.
michael_scott Good to see you. Where's your saxaphone?
mikela_lasker It's in the music room, Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
erin_hannon Wow!
michael_scott Well, you didn't even hear it.
mikela_lasker Everyone's so excited that you're here today.
michael_scott Oh, good.
mikela_lasker Now, I know you probably want to see everyone, but I was wondering if I could ask you some questions first?
michael_scott Sure.
erin_hannon You're famous.
mikela_lasker I'm sure you remember this place.
michael_scott Oh, yeah.
mikela_lasker Do you want to go in?
michael_scott No, not at all. Nope, come on.
michael_scott Oh, you know what? You know what? I shouldn't go in there. I'm pretty busy, I should just...
mikela_lasker We just want to say thanks.
michael_scott Oh.
student Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott!
Teacher#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode12 Mr. Scott, I know you're a busy man, and your schedule moves around a lot. But through all your generosity through the years, your tots, who are ready to graduate, thought it was time to give you a proper thank you.
student Oh! What? Oh! Break it down! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true! Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!
lefervre You came into our lives and made a promise, made us honest, made us realize, we don't need to compromise, cause we can have it all! Cause you made it possible, for us to achieve the improbable!
student Hey, Mr. Scott! What you gonna do? What you gonna do, make our dreams come true!
michael_scott Wow!
dwight_schrute Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
kevin_malone Hey.
dwight_schrute So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
kevin_malone Jim said that?
dwight_schrute He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
kevin_malone Jim said that?
dwight_schrute You seem suprised.
kevin_malone No, no, that makes total sense.
dwight_schrute Hey buddy, so every-
oscar_martinez Sure.
dwight_schrute Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule.
Teacher#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode12 Politicians are always coming around, telling us they're going to fix our schools, promising this and that. But you, Mr. Scott, you are actually doing it. You have taught these kids with hard work, that anything is possible. You are a dream maker and I thank you! I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, I thank you! So much.
lefervre There were a lot of times over the years where I was pressured to get into the drug game. But I always thought back to my guardian angel, and the gift that you gave me. So I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to go to college, educate myself, and become the next President Obama.
michael_scott Oh, God. Oh, God.
jim_halpert Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome. I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes. And the winner is, employee number nine. And that is?
andy_bernard Number nine, number nine. Jim Halpert.
all@ Huh? What?
oscar_martinez Are you kidding me?
dwight_schrute Oh, no!
jim_halpert Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
kevin_malone I... I... I did not... That was not... How come not?
jim_halpert Guys, listen. This was anonymous, all right? There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here. I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
angela_martin To my tally, you just won back your own parking spot, a vacation day, and a nice, tidy quarter of $1,000 from all of us.
jim_halpert Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it. A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out. Second of all, there was no cash prize.
angela_martin Yes!
jim_halpert Dwight?
dwight_schrute Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize." Isn't that what you said?
jim_halpert No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money. But-
phyllis_vance Yeah, but in your perfect world, only you get money.
Teacher#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode12 Let's put your hands together and give a warm welcome for the man of the hour, Mr. Michael Scott.
michael_scott All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "A" gym and "B" gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm. Should we go?
Teacher#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode12 Oh, no. We're okay. It's a double period
michael_scott Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
Zion#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode12 I'm Zion, I'm Mikela's younger brother.
michael_scott Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so, so sorry.
michael_scott I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
mikela_lasker You lied to us.
michael_scott I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place.
lefervre You owe this to us!
michael_scott Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
student
michael_scott Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. They're lithium.
jim_halpert Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it. Okay? This was your idea anyway.
andy_bernard Correction. It was my idea.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute My idea!
creed_bratton Guys, I'm starting to think Pam's not really even pregnant.
pam_beesly Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.
phyllis_vance That's fair.
dwight_schrute Excellent idea, Pam.
pam_beesly Thank you.
andy_bernard That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.
phyllis_vance How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
dwight_schrute There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
pam_beesly No, wait, come on. I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.
andy_bernard Oh, really? From what, two to four?
pam_beesly Yup.
jim_halpert Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?
cake_delivery_man Hi, I have an order here for a custom cake, Jim Halpert.
jim_halpert Okay. That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
kevin_malone Look who it is!
angela_martin "It could only be you!" Way to go.
dwight_schrute He knew all along!
kelly_kapoor I'm going to have some cake.
stephanie David Wallace's office.
dwight_schrute This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
stephanie No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message?
dwight_schrute Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
dwight_schrute This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace.
dwight_schrute It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
lefervre Hey, Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Erin, can you give us a second?
lefervre That was messed up what you did.
michael_scott Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.
lefervre Who does something like that? Who promises that to a bunch of kids and then just doesn't come through like that?
michael_scott What can I do?
lefervre You can pay for my college.
michael_scott I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this? If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
lefervre They're expensive.
michael_scott Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
lefervre It's about $1,000.
michael_scott Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year.
lefervre No, $1,000 each year.
michael_scott For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around.
lefervre Okay. Okay. Make it out to my mom, Rosa.
michael_scott That's a lot of zeroes.
jim_halpert This is Jim.
david_wallace Wallace Jim, what the hell is happening there?
jim_halpert Hey, uh David.
david_wallace Yes.
jim_halpert So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today. It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
david_wallace Just so I understand, you started Employee of the Month, give it to yourself, then people complain, so you give it to your wife?
jim_halpert No.
david_wallace Am I missing something?
jim_halpert I really don't know how it happened, David.
dwight_schrute I know how it happened.
david_wallace Jim, I bumped you up because I thought you could make my life easier. If you can't do that, we're going to have a separate discussion.
jim_halpert All right, it will not happen again. I promise.
david_wallace Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you.
dwight_schrute No!
david_wallace It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert Yeah. Thank you.
dwight_schrute No.
david_wallace Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert Yes.
david_wallace Okay.
dwight_schrute Oh, you're kidding me!
jim_halpert See you.
dwight_schrute Damn it!
erin_hannon Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do---
michael_scott Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today.
erin_hannon No.
michael_scott Yes.
erin_hannon No, there's financial aid, uh, they could join the army or the navy.
michael_scott You're what, like, 12?
erin_hannon The principal told me that 90% of Scott's Tots are on track to graduate, and that's 35% higher than the rest of the school. So I think if you hadn't made that promise, a lot of them would've dropped out. Which is something to think about, I think.
michael_scott I think you're doing a great job.
erin_hannon Really?
michael_scott What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?
erin_hannon I've always wondered what it might be like to be an accountant.
michael_scott Really?
erin_hannon Yes, but I'm terrible at math so...
michael_scott You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
erin_hannon Seriously?
michael_scott Yeah. I just sort've had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too.
michael_scott and Erin Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true. Hey Mr. Scott, What you gonna do, What you gonna do make our dreams come true.
jim_halpert See you tomorrow, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Apparently.
ryan_howard How's it going? Good day?
dwight_schrute Not now, Temp.
ryan_howard Um, okay, so, um, listen. I know about your diabolical plan.
dwight_schrute What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol...
ryan_howard I found a copy of it in the copier tray.
dwight_schrute So what do you want?
ryan_howard I want the same thing you want. I want to take Jim Halpert down. I want in.
