dwight_schrute Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
dwight_schrute Wake up!
dwight_schrute Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
erin_hannon Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
dwight_schrute Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
erin_hannon Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day!
stanley_hudson Mmm! Ugh!
dwight_schrute Good morning.
erin_hannon Hey, wake up. Let's have some fun. We're in Florida now.
ryan_howard Hey, you. I'm so glad this is happening. I actually came to your door twice last night. Come on in, the water's fine. Oh, not cool!
jim_halpert I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-
dwight_schrute Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? Oh man.
erin_hannon What do you think happened?
dwight_schrute Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh.
jim_halpert Puppet.
cathy_simms Cool, for your kids?
jim_halpert Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
dwight_schrute Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
dwight_schrute I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
dwight_schrute I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
Saleswoman#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode15 What does he like?
dwight_schrute Power.
ryan_howard Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here."
dwight_schrute Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
erin_hannon Hey, are you okay?
dwight_schrute I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
erin_hannon Who says none of us are diarrheal?
jim_halpert Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
dwight_schrute Very funny, Jim.
jim_halpert Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
dwight_schrute I'm gonna set your face on fire.
jim_halpert That's a good one. Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
stanley_hudson Laugh it up, Halpert. I'm in Florida for a month without my family. I'm gonna enjoy this. Want to get in? You can work the iPod.
jim_halpert Yes.
stanley_hudson You're a nice guy, Jim, but you have no idea how to vacation. Find some Kenny Loggins.
jim_halpert Loggins and Messina.
stanley_hudson Did I say "Messina?"
andy_bernard Ahh! Sorry I couldn't resist. It's so quiet.
creed_bratton I like it. It's so peaceful, I've already written like, twelve plays today.
andy_bernard It's so quiet, one might say, you could hear a pin... I thought that would be cooler.
darryl_philbin I loved it.
meredith_palmer Hey, can you pick up the pin? Some of us like to work in our bare feet.
andy_bernard Of course, I will pick up the pin. It is right here. Got it.
oscar_martinez Can we see that? Did you really find it?
andy_bernard Yes, right here. Got it. Dink, ow. In the trash.
pam_beesly Hey, why is it so quiet? Shouldn't the phone be ringing? Uh-oh. Erin set the phone to voicemail.
all@ Oh great.
kelly_kapoor We're screwed.
pam_beesly There.
andy_bernard Oh! There we go! Pam?
pam_beesly Yeah?
andy_bernard Can you get the phone?
pam_beesly Well I'm not the receptionist.
andy_bernard Mm, well, you used to be.
pam_beesly I know, but I can't cover reception. I have a ton of work to do.
andy_bernard Phone's ringing.
kelly_kapoor Will one of you get the phone? I am freaking out! I know it's for me. Are you guys kidding me? Stop flirting and someone get the phone!
all@ Somebody! Answer the phone.
kelly_kapoor Andy, pick up the phone!
stanley_hudson Get the damn phone.
meredith_palmer You're the closest one to it.
andy_bernard Fine. Hello, Dunder Mifflin. Hello, you've reached Dunder Mifflin. How may I be of service?
jim_halpert Man.
cathy_simms How was the drive?
jim_halpert Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
stanley_hudson Life is short. "Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse." That's one of my mottoes.
jim_halpert I would love to hear the other mottos.
todd_packer Quick query, Halpert.
jim_halpert No way.
todd_packer Still queer?
dwight_schrute Packer.
todd_packer You can't put me down. Too strong!
todd_packer Yeah, Dwight and Jim tried to get me fired, but I landed on my feet down here in Florida. You see, this cat's got nine lives, and a nine-inch-
nellie_bertram Psst. Say, "So who's leading this thing, anyway?"
ryan_howard So who's leading this thing, anyway?
nellie_bertram Psst. Say, "I can't wait to meet him."
ryan_howard I can't wait to meet him.
nellie_bertram Him, you say? Don't think a woman can be a leader?
ryan_howard I-
nellie_bertram You poor, simple boy. Expected a man, did you? Strong, powerful. Huge, whopping pen1s? Well, sorry to disappoint, but my huge, whopping pen1s is right here, and I'm not afraid to use it. So stop looking at my breasts, and start looking at my pen1s. I'm Nellie Bertram, president of special projects. In the next few weeks we're going to throw everything you know about business out of the window and do it our own way. Are your minds blown? So, how did this special project come about anyway? Well, I interviewed to be the manager of your branch. After you decided I wasn't "a good fit-"
jim_halpert It was-
nellie_bertram Ah! It was. I went on a shopping spree. Very destructive. I bought thirteen pianos. Then I realized, what if Sabre had a store? Hmm? So I called Jo, old friend, founder of Sabre, and I told her and she grabbed me by the shoulders and she said, "Yes!" So let's talk about the Sabre store then. Probably gonna look stupid, right? Like a big turd with a door on the front, right? What do you think it should look like?
cathy_simms Um, it might be fun if each store had a different theme, like a beach one, a winter one, a jungle one.
nellie_bertram No, not a big fan of the winter aesthetic.
cathy_simms Well that was just one idea. It doesn't have to be winter.
nellie_bertram Oh, no, it does. It does. It has to be winter, and I reject it. So I drew up a design concept. Probably gonna be rubbish, right? Would you like to look at it? Just so you could laugh at it.
erin_hannon Yeah!
nellie_bertram Let me just get the projector working.
dwight_schrute Uh.
jim_halpert You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
dwight_schrute You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute What is the antidote?
jim_halpert True love's kiss.
nellie_bertram Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
dwight_schrute I'll do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head.
todd_packer I can do it.
dwight_schrute Mmm! There we go.
dwight_schrute Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. What kind of poison did you use?
jim_halpert Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
dwight_schrute Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
nellie_bertram Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me.
Emergency#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode15 Operator Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?
dwight_schrute Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
todd_packer I tell you what though, since my move down to Florida I've really gotten back into hunting big time.
nellie_bertram Hunting's so primal. Almost sexual.
todd_packer Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
dwight_schrute You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
todd_packer Did you say "masturbator?"
dwight_schrute I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
nellie_bertram Why are you sitting down like that?
dwight_schrute Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
jim_halpert Wow. Are you that bored?
stanley_hudson It's just rum. I'm not bored, I'm a pirate.
jim_halpert Is that another motto?
stanley_hudson It's whatever you want.
jim_halpert Mmm.
stanley_hudson Or do you only drink with your kids?
jim_halpert Ah, let's do it. Oh, that's healthy.
jim_halpert I've spent so much of my life telling myself "Please, don't end up like Stanley," and now I'm wondering if I even have what it takes.
nellie_bertram We have the Sabre Pyramid, right? Hmm? We've got a bunch of humans. You guys, humans... pyramid. Human pyramid. Do you follow? It's a team-building exercise. You'll love it. Who's in? Hmm?
todd_packer Yup. Tallahassee, let's go.
erin_hannon Jim, are you in?
jim_halpert Oh, I don't know.
stanley_hudson Sounds like a hoot. I'm in.
jim_halpert All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
todd_packer This is great. This is gonna be great.
nellie_bertram I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.
dwight_schrute I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
ryan_howard Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
dwight_schrute Ahh!
ryan_howard Dwight?
jim_halpert Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
dwight_schrute Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
todd_packer Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
dwight_schrute Stop moving!
jim_halpert No one's moving!
dwight_schrute Oh!
all@ Oh, oh!
dwight_schrute Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
jim_halpert Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
jim_halpert The one thing Pam made sure I knew, Florida's pretty loose with the death penalty.
paramedic You need an operation. You have appendicitis.
ryan_howard Oh! Who called it? Nothin' but net.
erin_hannon How long will he be gone?
paramedic Two or three days.
dwight_schrute Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
todd_packer Drama queen, am I right?
dwight_schrute Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
todd_packer That was an interesting diversion. Shall we get back to the meeting?
pam_beesly Whoa, are those mini pizzas?
andy_bernard Yeah, I figured we'd keep things savory while Oscar's mouth is in canker country. I also have some bacon-wrapped dates on deck.
kevin_malone Look at these little mini pizzas. Does this make me look huge? Hey guys, look at me, I'm huge.
andy_bernard Hey Darryl, good news, your fax went through.
darryl_philbin Oh yeah.
andy_bernard Up high.
darryl_philbin Yes sir. Thanks.
andy_bernard Dunder Mifflin, this is Andy. I put out some new magazines, check it out.
creed_bratton Ah, Dwell.
andy_bernard I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. Oh, there's the phone!
dwight_schrute I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
erin_hannon Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
dwight_schrute Who's doing the presentations?
erin_hannon Packer's giving one. Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
dwight_schrute Damn it!
erin_hannon Let's see, what else have you missed? Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now it's like if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dip, but if you switch, you're a copycat. But I think I figured out a solution. What else? My shoes are gonna-
todd_packer -features a tech support area. Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot. Huge for building loyalty.
nellie_bertram Very good point.
dwight_schrute Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
nellie_bertram Dwight, are you all right?
dwight_schrute I'm great. How are you?
dwight_schrute What's our presentation about?
jim_halpert Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
dwight_schrute I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
erin_hannon Do a hundred jumping jacks.
dwight_schrute No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
erin_hannon I don't feel like it either!
erin_hannon Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
dwight_schrute I want that vice-presidency.
jim_halpert You haven't done any of the research.
dwight_schrute "You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
stanley_hudson Aw, let him do it.
jim_halpert Stanley, are you listening to music?
stanley_hudson Yup.
dwight_schrute All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
nellie_bertram Ah, what is your topic?
dwight_schrute What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
erin_hannon Retail consumer habits.
dwight_schrute Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
dwight_schrute Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
ryan_howard I can field this one.
dwight_schrute No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God. Next slide.
andy_bernard Mail call! His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
kevin_malone Are those the lyrics?
dwight_schrute Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
nellie_bertram What are the three pillars of retail?
erin_hannon Convenience.
dwight_schrute Ingredients.
erin_hannon Service.
dwight_schrute Burgers.
erin_hannon Building loyalty.
dwight_schrute Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.
nellie_bertram Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
jim_halpert You are bleeding through your shirt.
dwight_schrute Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. Ah.
pam_beesly Hey, having fun?
andy_bernard Yes I am, as a matter of fact.
pam_beesly Well I know how it is. I know it's a lot of fun. I don't know how it is. Andy, this is a lame job. What are you doing here?
andy_bernard I found my calling.
darryl_philbin Andy, when I was twelve years old, we did a field trip, a lock-in at the zoo. I met this girl, I thought she was so perfect. I was in love with her. But when the sun came up, I knew it wasn't real, 'cause she was ugly and I had grown tired of her. I know you want reception today, but tomorrow you won't want to do her. She's a dog.
pam_beesly Guys, I don't like this analogy.
andy_bernard Ugh! Fine. Did you see this?
pam_beesly It's nice.
andy_bernard I mean...
nellie_bertram How are you feeling?
dwight_schrute Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
nellie_bertram Can I see the wound?
dwight_schrute Oh God.
nellie_bertram Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
dwight_schrute You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
nellie_bertram A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
dwight_schrute That's right.
nellie_bertram That is amazing. Todd, look at that.
todd_packer Oh, yikes. Incoming-
dwight_schrute Ah! Not so fast.
nellie_bertram Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you have a lot to offer.
todd_packer It would be an honor, ma'am.
dwight_schrute I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
dwight_schrute I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
andy_bernard Dunder Mifflin, how can I help you save money on paper? This is Andrew.
donna_muraski Muraski Hi Andrew. What happened to Erin?
andy_bernard Oh, she's on an assignment in Florida for a couple of weeks.
donna_muraski Muraski Oh, good for her. She's such a sweetheart. You tell her Donna Muraski misses her.
andy_bernard I miss her too.
nellie_bertram Everyone, we have a very special guest. He turned an idea into a store, into hundreds of stores. I give you Wally Amos, founder of Famous Amos Cookies.
wally_amos Amos Aloha, aloha, aloha. So I hear you're all looking to bake up some dough in the sales game. Well, back when I was regular Amos-
stanley_hudson What's under the cloth?
wally_amos Amos We'll get to that.
todd_packer Cookies. Bet you anything it's cookies.
wally_amos Amos It's cookies. Let me- let me finish my speech first.
nellie_bertram Ah, we get the gist. It's just success and effort, isn't it? So just, don't be coy, make with the cookies!
erin_hannon Famous, hi. I'm sure you get ideas for new cookies all the time, but I-
wally_amos Amos Is it oatmeal with no raisins?
erin_hannon I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
