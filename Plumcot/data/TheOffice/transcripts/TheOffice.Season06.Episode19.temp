michael Hello hello. Top of the morning to you! Ooh ooh! Green M&amp;Ms! Nature's Viagra! Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
kelly I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
ryan Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
kelly Well why don't you invite your friends?
ryan Why are you being so weird about this?
meredith Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
ryan Why no kids?
kelly Yeah, where are your kids?
meredith Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
michael It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
erin Welcome back, "Dad!"
jim Oh, thank you!
phyllis Hey!
stanley Hey!
andy Welcome back Tuna!
jim Hey.
dwight Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
jim What do we got here?
dwight Mega-Desk.
jim Of course.
dwight Command central.
jim Hm hm.
dwight Surveillance, gaming- and business.
jim Okay. Just gotta.
dwight Okay. Come on! Jim!
dwight Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But . I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
jo Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling!
jim Morning!
jo Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something.
jo Oh good morning sweetheart.
michael Morning, honey-pile.
jo I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
michael It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
jo Is that a lump of coal?
michael Yes it is!
jo Have I been that naughty?
michael No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
jo Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.
michael Mm, that sounds great, actually.
jo Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.
michael When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
andy erin go braugh!
erin andy go braugh to you! Nice kilt!
andy Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
andy erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to "How I Met Your Mother" that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
jim No.
dwight Great.
jim No.
dwight Thank you.
jim No-no-no-no-no.
dwight Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
jim Is this yours or mine?
dwight They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
jim Good Lord! I can't believe I'm missing this.
pam It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
jim Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.
dwight Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
jim It is. Big time.
dwight Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
jim Pretty amazing.
dwight What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
jim Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
dwight I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
jim Is that what happened to you?
dwight I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
jim That's a common mistake.
dwight Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
angela Hey! Are you sick?
erin Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
angela In your nose?
erin Yes.
erin I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
jo Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.
michael That is a great idea JB.
jo Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist.
kevin Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
jo You know it doesn't have to be an invention.
oscar I have a question.
michael Oscar, homosexual accountant.
oscar In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
jo I am so proud of Sabre's "Print In All Colors" initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. Daryl?
michael Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse.
jo Okay hush now.
michael Okay.
daryl The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.
jo But you wouldn't need more trucks?
daryl Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
jo Oh look at you.
michael Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
jo I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?
daryl Are you serious?
jo Yeah. Take Jim's old office.
gabe Um. I set my stuff up in there. So. just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
jo Yeah, I want to hear more from you.
daryl Absolutely.
jo All right.
daryl Thank you.
jo Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!
michael Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
jo Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away.
michael Well, I am heading down there.
jo Well, anytime now.
michael How about July 4th weekend?
jo Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket?
michael I did!
jo Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?
michael You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
jo Enough!
michael All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
michael Let's follow the chain of events. jo likes Michael. jo invites michael to house. jo doesn't like michael anymore. Hmmm.
daryl Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky.
michael Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.
jo No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
michael No is not an option.
jo Yes it is.
michael All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
jo How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
michael I'll be over there.
jim And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
dwight Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
jim What?
dwight My headphones are broken.
jim Right.
dwight Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
jim Yeah that's great. Great.
dwight Okay? "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"
jim When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
d "- and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-"
jim Please stop that!
dwight "-But we'll be together then-"
jim Can you grow up?
dwight "-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then. "
jim Whether it's this time or next time.
andy "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon"
jim Yeah. andy and
dwight "Little boy blue and the man in the moon. "
jim No, we definitely can talk about it in the next-- andy and
dwight "When you coming home Dad?
jim You know, can I call you back? andy and
dwight "I don't know when-"
jim That would be great, thank you. andy and
dwight "But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-" . push;
jim No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
jim I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
erin This fax came for you.
jo Oh no no no! Are you feeling ill?
erin Uh.
jo Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with dwight Howard next week.
erin Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
jo Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?
erin Well.
andy She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
jo Yes?
andy I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you.
jo Oh! You're sick! Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home.
andy No, no, no, no, no.
jo Get everybody sick in the office.
andy I have some good ideas.
jo We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now.
andy You sure?
jo You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
michael Very nice.
daryl Not bad, huh?
michael A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
daryl I impressed her with my good ideas.
michael Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
daryl I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
michael How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
daryl Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.
michael Okay. All right.
jo Hey there.
michael Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
jo Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time.
michael Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
jo Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work.
michael Right. What?
jo Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.
michael Mm. mm. Oh well.
jo Anything else I can help you with?
michael No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
kevin Just because jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. oscar has a life. I think ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
michael Hey Pack-man. Todd
packer Hey what's up, Butt-plug?
michael How you doing stud? You already there? Todd
packer Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
michael How's the lady situation? Todd
packer Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
michael Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late. Todd
packer Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
michael Yeah. Maybe next year. Todd
packer Maybe next "queer. " Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?
erin Oh! Andy!
andy Hi!
erin I'm in my jammy-jams!
andy That's okay, I'm in my "worky-works. " You look amazing!
erin Oh, thanks. Come in!
meredith Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
kevin Oh I'm in.
oscar I'm in.
meredith All right.
jo Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!
dwight Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.
dwight Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening I have.
jo Hello?
jim Hey Jo, it's jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7
 30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
jo Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.
jim You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
jo Okay.
jim Okay.
jo Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?
dwight Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
jo Thank you.
jim Thanks again by the way.
daryl Hey! What are you fellas doing up here? Warehouse guy 1
 We're here to bust you out!
daryl I wish, but uh- Warehouse guy 1
 Dude! Your shirt tucked in?
daryl Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom. All right then, uh, let me get to it. Warehouse guy 1
 All right. Warehouse guy 2
 See you later.
erin Your hand's cold.
andy It is? I'm sorry.
erin Yeah, have some more blanket.
andy Okay, thanks.
reid What's up?
andy Whoa!
erin You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
andy I didn't know you had a brother.
erin He's my foster brother.
andy Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. andy Bernard.
reid Cold hands.
andy Are we rotating seats, or?
reid Oh yeah, you're the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet.
erin Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them!
reid Ooh!
andy So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
erin None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
andy All right. Formative years.
reid Nice skirt.
andy Yeah, it's a kilt. Night cleaning
crew Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry.
angela Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
jo Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves. I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.
michael How late do we have to work tonight?
gabe You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
michael Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
gabe Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right? I will date when I'm dead!
michael Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
michael Hello Jo.
jo Anything I can do for you Puddin'?
michael There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8
 30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
jo Hmm.
michael I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
jo All right then.
michael Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
jo Michael?
michael Yes.
jo I look forward to that too.
andy Ooh. It's coming down out there.
erin Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
andy No, I-
erin I'm so sorry I was so sick.
andy Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick.
michael Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys! Meredith, Creed, oscar and
matt 
michael Drinks are on me!
oscar No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
michael Oh -hoh! All right.
michael Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself
something Do I even like her? As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, "Don't worry, be happy. " Todd
packer Whoops!
michael Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. What the hell is going on back there?
jim Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. Thank you.
dwight What the hell is this?
jim Oh!
dwight This is not Mega-Desk.
jim No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
dwight That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
jim Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we?
dwight Hello, dwight Schrute?
