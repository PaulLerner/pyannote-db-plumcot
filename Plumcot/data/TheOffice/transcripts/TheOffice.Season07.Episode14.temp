brent Oh, sorry, mate.
michael Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
david What you doing?
michael English?
david You picked on the wrong person, I can tell you that.
michael Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
david Yeah big time, yeah.
michael I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi. It's called Reginald Pooftah.
david Ooh! david Brent, my liege. How are you?
michael michael Scott.
david Oh, there you go. I do characters as well. I got a Chinese fella. He's called Ho Li . That's what it sounds like.
michael 
david Herrow! Herrow!
michael I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
david You can't do that these days. You can't.
michael No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
david No, no. No, comedy is a place where the mind goes to tickle itself. That's what she said. . Ohh.
michael That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
david Where are you working?
michael Dunder Mifflin.
david Any jobs now?
michael No, not right now.
david Just let me know.
michael All right. See you around.
david All right.
michael Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
erin Your first student is here, Mister Bernard.
andy That's actually "Master of Ceremonies" Bernard.
andy Last year, I went to a seminar called "The Ten Secrets of Real Estate". Turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in Idaho. Cut to, you know, spending a weekend in Boise, terrible time, super lonely. But I get to thinking maybe I should put on my own seminar to lure clients.
erin Oh it's.
michael Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
erin Michael?
michael Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
erin Ooh. Wait, Michael?
michael Okay.
michael I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character "Mikanos", is just a little added flava. "Mikanos" is loosely based on another character I do, "Spiros", who is more about the ladies.
andy Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.
jim Listen, this isn't a favor, all right? This is a good idea. We all win.
andy Go higher. I get super flexible when I'm nervous.
jim Wow. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey, Andy, I'm really, really sorry to do this to you, but I have a meeting today that I totally forgot, so I can't be apart of this seminar.
andy No. What? You can't do that. You are a critical part of this seminar. You're the charming warm-up guy,
jim I know.
andy If the seminar was a meal, you'd be the amuse-bouche. You like, signal the flavors of the whole night.
jim I'm really sorry. I can't do it.
andy You can't. You can't.
andy I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.
jim Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?
pam What's going on? Do you know that guy?
jim I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
dwight Hey.
jim Hey.
dwight How are the marks?
dwight What are some of your small business ideas? Older
guy I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts. Phyllis, Stanley,
dwight Oooh!
dwight That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
phyllis A lot of mines in Scranton.
dwight Um, what about you? Younger
guy Uh, credit cards.
dwight Uh-huh. Younger
guy My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.
dwight Wow! Younger
guy Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents.
dwight Right. Okay? Great.
stanley Great.
dwight You promised us whales. These are worms.
andy They're not worms, Dwight, okay? They're just people with tiny businesses. They're baby whales which is even cuter.
stanley I'm out.
andy Stanley, you're suppose to close.
phyllis I'm out too.
andy What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
dwight We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
michael You know what might be kind of fun? I was thinking , you know andy is having a seminar today? What if we went in as a greek couple? Mikanos and.
holly Oh, I don't know, Michael. I'm not feeling up to that.
michael Okay.
michael holly broke up with A. J last week, which is the greatest thing that has ever happened. to me. To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information? That's what I thought. But, you know what? Here I am using it.
michael If-a you change-a you mind, why don't you talk to Mikanos?
holly Is Mikanos greek? He sounds Italian.
michael Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
holly Maybe Mikanos ran away to join the Italian circus.
michael Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. tom Hanks does that.
erin Down. there. Is "jlp" a word?
pam "Jelp?" J-e-l-p?
erin No, j-l-p. Like, "I jlp. I jlp you!"
pam I don't think that's a word.
erin I'm playing Scrabble with Gabe, and I've never won a game.
erin The winner gets to pick the movie we watch. I have won no games. So far I've seen "The Shining", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Ring". Not really my thing. Although, I. I do like the early parts of the movies where they have a perfect family and everything.
pam You want some help?
erin Really?
pam Mm-hmm.
erin Yes.
pam K-a. "Ka"? What does "ka" mean?
oscar It means you're playing someone who's going to destroy you. Why did you play "moo"?
erin Because I'm playing to win. I'm playing "moo", I'm playing "milk". Whatever it takes.
oscar Okay, but look, you could have hit "mood". Would have played a.
erin Uh.
oscar A triple word.
erin Like the cow mood yesterday. God.
oscar Or moon.
erin The cow jumped over the moon.
oscar She's stuck on that one thing.
pam No, it doesn't have to just be cow stuff, right?
andy Kevin, jim dropped out of my seminar, and I'm just. I was wondering if you could replace him as my charming warm up guy.
kevin Andy, I'm no Jim. The only way that I'm jim is in the movie version when jim sees what his future would be like if he never met Pam.
andy Hey, that's crazy talk. I think you're great.
kevin Then I won't let you down.
kelly Cake.
ryan In you go.
andy Hi, Ryan, you went to business school, right?
ryan Yup.
andy I need somebody to talk to this seminar about business.
ryan And?
andy Can you do it?
ryan Okay. I don't. I don't like committing to things just like that.
andy So no?
ryan No, I don't like committing to not doing things, either. That's just as big a commitment.
kelly Oh, baby.
andy What do I put you down for, bro hombre?
ryan Yes.
andy All right!
ryan Yes, I'll do it.
andy Okay, than you so much. It's going to be so awesome.
ryan And if I flake, I flake.
andy What?
andy Kevin, you open it up.
kevin Yep.
andy Ryan, you come in with your small biz expertise, right? And then
creed guest speaker extraordinaire. And then I come in and just close all the sales and stuff. Um, okay, here we go. One, two three!
kevin Go.
creed Creed! Ha!
andy Welcome everybody. Awesome to see you guys. My name is andy Bernard but you can call me The Nard Dog. Older
woman Hi Nard Dog. I'm Lu Peachem.
andy Let's get things started, shall we? You guys ready to hear from the Dunder Mifflin business experts? Good. Well, as you can see on your program. first up is a speech called, "Don't Just Dream it, do it. " Yes! Please give a big hand to Mr. kevin Malone.
kevin Yes!
kevin There are some people who have charm and some people who don't. Guess which type I am. Charm type.
kevin Dream. big. Right? So what I want you to do is dream the biggest that you c. an. And then double it! .
andy Are you okay?
kevin No. Yes!
andy Here.
kevin No. I'm fine. Okay, from here now. The first lesson that I'm gonna teach you, right, is about finding success. And the key to finding success is to picture a winner. . Okay, so then, what are you picturing right now, right this second? 'Cause the universe is yours, people. Get out of the way!
andy I'm really excited to introduce you guys to ryan Howard. He has achieved a great deal in the last.
kelly But perhaps no achievement is greater than his on-again, off-again girlfriend.
andy What are you.
kelly Who am I? I'm kelly Kapoor, the business bitch.
kelly It is important to brand yourself, so I have a couple of things in works. "The Business Bitch", "The Diet Bitch", "The Shopping Bitch", "The Etiquette Bitch. " . push;
kelly I could sit here, and I could tell you the ten secrets of business, and you would have a great time, and you would learn a lot. But who better to tell you than the Yale University adjunct professor in management, Professor Scott Powell, who I have on my Blackberry. It's ringing. Professor
powell Hey, kelly Kapoor. What a delicious surprise.
kelly Profess Powell, you are on speakerphone. Professor
powell Uh, why?
kelly Do you think you could tell us the ten secrets of business? Professor
powell Um, there aren't really ten secrets.
kelly Come on Scott, please? It's me. Professor
powell Um, all right. Well, um, I guess know your market would be key. Practice fiscal discipline.
kelly Mm-hmm.
andy That brilliant little bitch.
oscar A little treat for our old friend Gabe. Put that "q" right there.
erin Wait. Why?
oscar Put the "q" there, sweetie.
pam I think there's better.
oscar Put the "q" there! Sorry I yelled.
pam You could have just told us what you were thinking.
oscar There's no theater in that.
pam There's no yelling in that, either.
oscar Well.
holly What do you do in your free time?
michael Practice Olympics.
holly Mmm. Do you like movies?
michael I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home".
holly We have to try this out on somebody.
michael Hello.
hank Look, you want to order something?
michael She will have a greekaccino.
hank I don't know what that is.
michael It.
holly It's a very strong coffee with milk from a goat.
michael I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
holly No more brain damage.
michael No more brain damage!
holly Ahh!
holly I don't know.
andy Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest speaker will provoke you. He will inspire you. He is. creed Bratton.
creed Two eyes, two ears, a chin, a mouth, ten fingers, two nipples. A butt, two kneecaps, a pen1s. I have just described to you the Loch Ness Monster. And the reward for its capture? All the riches in Scotland. So I have one
question Why are you here?
andy Okay. All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is now time for the rarest of things, an actual free lunch. There are sandwiches in the back. Certainly help yourselves. We'll meet back up in an hour.
gabe I picked out our movie. It's called "Suspiria". It pushes all the boundaries. All your preconceived notions about what horror can be come crashing down.
erin When I win.
gabe Ooh.
erin We're gonna watch "Wall-e", where all the boundaries of color are pushed.
gabe It is hard to explain why erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
dwight So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
guy Well, I started my own golf supply company.
dwight Really?
guy It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth.
dwight Phyllis?
phyllis Hmm?
dwight Some of these people are for real.
dwight Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
andy Thank you.
dwight Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
andy Really?
darryl Ahem!
andy Excuse me.
dwight I got it. I got it.
andy Hey, do you need a lozenge?
darryl They're a bunch of jackals.
andy What?
darryl They left you in the lurch, and if they want to jump in, it means you're almost there. You did this. Bring it home.
andy
 Let me tell you what you can do with your offer to help. You can table it and offer it up another time. Just know that I really appreciate the gesture.
andy Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
dwight You're gonna blow it.
andy Maybe. Only maybe.
oscar We got it! Wow! We got it!
pam Oscar, wait. I think the victory would be more meaningful if erin puts the last word in herself.
oscar Yes, Pam. Yes, most definitely. Yes.
erin Yes.
oscar Ah. No! . Although I must say, I will have "apoplexy" if you lose. Do you understand? "Apoplexy" is what I will have.
erin Apoplexy.
oscar Yes.
erin Got it. Oh, Oscar. Oscar?
erin I played "ape. "
jim I just want to make a point to that last caller. I disagree. I don't think it is the running game at all. I think we do have to make a few moves in this off-season.
andy Wow! What a day, right? Guess you guys are probably ready to go. And you got my business card, so.
michael Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you. All, you have to close right now.
andy Yeah, I mean, I'm getting to it.
michael No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
andy Yeah, yeah.
michael Andy, what's the problem?
andy This is hard for me. I'm a nice guy.
michael You, kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close. What is taking that guy so long?
jim Psst. You think this thing's gonna go much longer?
pam I don't know. They're still in there.
jim Ohh! Good-bye.
pam Stop. Out with it.
pam Here's the story. That guy in there is Jim's childhood friend, Tom.
jim tom Witochkin. One of my best buddies, actually.
pam And when they were both in the third grade, jim was placed in the top reading group.
jim I was blue group, so it was second from the top.
pam And Tom.
jim Was in the green group.
pam And Jim's mom suggested that jim spend time hanging with the kids in his reading group, because she though that would be a good influence.
jim And that's what I told him.
pam Right. But how'd you say it?
jim "My mom thinks you're too dumb to hang out with. "
andy Okay, who would like to purchase this small business package from me right now? Yes, we got one. Okay, the snowball is rolling. Who else? You can put it off for a couple of days, but I guarantee you, eventually you're gonna realize you need this. So the only thing that's gonna be different is you'll be a couple of days behind where you would be if you bought this from me right now. So who's gonna buy one right now? Older
woman I'll take one.
andy Yes! Awesome! All right, anyone else? Sold! Anybody else? Yes! All right!
kelly Yeah bitch.
andy Good choice. The rest of you are dead to me. You made the stupidest decision of your life.
michael No, no, no.
andy But it was a pleasure meeting you, and you've got my information, so feel free to call anytime.
kelly Whoo!
tom Hey, you think it's cool if I grab a soda?
jim Yeah, woah. Yep, absolutely, go ahead.
tom Hey.
jim Hey.
tom How's it goin'?
jim Pretty good.
tom It's been a while.
jim It has been, yeah.
tom So you work here, huh?
jim Sales.
tom Must be a front for some kind of famous laboratory.
jim 
tom 'Cause you're so smart.
jim Oh, man. You remember that, huh?
tom Oh, barely. I'm so dumb, you know, stuff goes in, stuff goes out. Not like you probably remember every paper sale you ever made. Paper salesman genius.
jim All right, good catch-up.
tom Yeah.
jim See ya.
tom Where's your jetpack, Zuckerberg?
dwight Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
andy Well, I guess when you looked in me, you forgot about my balls. They're on the outside. Don't how you missed 'em.
holly Wonderful seminar!
michael Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
holly Michael, I should get back to work.
michael What? Come on. It's time for grapes. Real fun day.
gabe So, I won.
erin I know. You get to pick.
gabe Well, that's actually what I came to talk to you about. I know how much you want to watch "Wall-e".
erin Yes?
gabe So I got us a compromise. This movie's called "Hardware". It tells the story of a killer combat robot, just like Wall-e, that the government invented to destroy humans. It's some of what you like and some of what I like, and. married.
andy Hey, I heard you talking about movies before, and, anyway, I just watched this over the weekend. I thought you'd really like it.
erin There's a "Shrek" two?!
andy Oh, yeah. See you tomorrow.
gabe Nice guy.
erin Ohh.
