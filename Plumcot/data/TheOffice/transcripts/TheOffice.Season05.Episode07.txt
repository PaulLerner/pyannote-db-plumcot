michael_scott Did you know that in Morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time? In Japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment. In Italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom. This is considered to be polite.
jim_halpert Why are you telling us this?
michael_scott I am jetting off on an international business trip.
jim_halpert Where are you going?
michael_scott To Can-A-da.
jim_halpert Where is it?
michael_scott Canada.
jim_halpert Okay.
michael_scott My boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and I have always been intrigued by all things international. The women, the pancakes, the man of mystery...
michael_scott Meredith, I would like you to pretend that you are from Abu Dhabi.
meredith_palmer Hello.
michael_scott I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket. You are now sexy in your culture.
kevin_malone T minus...
jim_halpert Six point five days.
creed_bratton One more week.
jim_halpert Pam comes back from New York next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me. And involved. And intrusive. And weird.
phyllis_vance On more week.
stanley_hudson Heh heh.
david_wallace Wallace Do you have your passport?
michael_scott I have my passport.
david_wallace Wallace Got your per diem?
michael_scott I have my per diem. I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.
david_wallace Wallace Michael, the... that's for your food.
michael_scott Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
david_wallace Wallace I was happy to send Michael on this trip. He's been feeling pretty down since we had to transfer Holly up to New Hampshire. But this little perk really seemed to turn him around. And it's pretty tough to find somebody who wants to go up to Winnipeg mid-November.
michael_scott And business class air, like a five-star hotel in the sky, nothing but the best. Actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big, cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat, whatever the mind can imagine. I think I am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce.
david_wallace Wallace Well, I'm just glad to know you're happy because you know I felt bad.
michael_scott Well that is all in the past.
david_wallace Wallace And in terms of nightlife, when you get there just ask the concierge.
michael_scott They have one of those?
michael_scott Lets do this!
dwight_schrute Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
michael_scott Two are for souvenirs.
dwight_schrute Do you have your money belt?
michael_scott I do. It's right here.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.
michael_scott No, I don't want to wear a bra.
dwight_schrute Here, let me help you.
michael_scott Stop it! Stop it!
dwight_schrute Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
michael_scott Okay. Where is my translator?
andy_bernard Monsieur.
michael_scott There he is.
andy_bernard I'm just bidding a bon voyage a La Mon Petit fiancee. Translation Goodbye my petite fiancee.
angela_martin Be good.
andy_bernard I will try.
angela_martin Meaning what?
andy_bernard Meaning I will try to get other dudes laid.
michael_scott Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man?
oscar_martinez Here.
michael_scott There we go. Our town car awaits.
meredith_palmer It's just a van.
michael_scott Its not just a van.
meredith_palmer Look, I know my way around a van. That is just a van.
michael_scott Dwight, can you get those please?
dwight_schrute
michael_scott Welcome to Cribs-the business class edition. Check this out. Mimosa.
andy_bernard Ah... sweet!
michael_scott Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet.
andy_bernard Michael Gary Scott rolling like a pimp!
michael_scott Take a sip of that.
andy_bernard Mmmhmmm...
michael_scott That good?
andy_bernard Mmmm...
michael_scott Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar.
andy_bernard That's really good.
oscar_martinez I'm good.
michael_scott You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
stewardess_beth I'm sorry. You'll need to keep moving.
michael_scott Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
stewardess_beth We need to keep the isle clear.
michael_scott Yes...
andy_bernard Oh...
michael_scott Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums.
andy_bernard Oh boy.
michael_scott Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
oscar_martinez Andy brought one too.
andy_bernard Harry and the Henderson's
michael_scott Shhhh! Keep it down.
oscar_martinez I made egg salad sandwiches. Do you want one?
michael_scott Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane? My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
michael_scott Hi.
stewardess_beth Hi.
michael_scott Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
stewardess_beth Oh, I'm sorry. There are no meals on flights less than two hours.
michael_scott Oh... okay. Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it... and oh! Look at that. I can't see because I am in a-- GAH!
stewardess_beth What would you like to drink?
ryan_howard Just checking out where I'm going to be pretty soon. When Pam gets back. Gonna be close quarters. Gonna be a lot of tension.
kelly_kapoor For you. I'm with Darryl.
ryan_howard This looks like where I'll probably do my pushups every day.
kelly_kapoor Is that supposed to impress me?
kelly_kapoor No. Not going to happen. He has hurt me too much and too often. And I am in a healthy relationship so I'm not gonna flaunt it and I'm not gonna hurt him, but that door is closed.
kelly_kapoor What are we doing? This is so wrong.
ryan_howard Yeah... Mmmmm...
michael_scott This is nice. This is nice. Move in here. Very sweet... ah.
oscar_martinez I'll check us in.
michael_scott Alright.
andy_bernard Very cool.
michael_scott Very cool.
andy_bernard We are going to find out where the action is, my friend.
michael_scott Okay.
andy_bernard Where's the concierge?
michael_scott Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
andy_bernard Mmm... bingo! Follow moi, bro-sieur.
michael_scott Wow!
andy_bernard What about a nice sushi place? Maybe a place with a view?
concierge_marie Tsk... Oh. Matsuki. That's a good one. Uh, you may walk there if you wish or you man take the number seventeen bus until 9 00. Other than that you can take the taxi and the number is right there.
michael_scott Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
andy_bernard One final question. Where might you find yourself on a Winnipeg night like tonight?
concierge_marie Oh, the Huntsman is good.
andy_bernard The Huntsman.
concierge_marie Down here... the financial district.
michael_scott A concierge is like the Winnipeg equivalent of a geisha. This is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure. And when you meet one, it is intoxicating. Just what the doctor ordered.
pam_beesly Can't believe this.
jim_halpert Are you sure?
pam_beesly I just talked to my advisor. Failing.
jim_halpert Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
pam_beesly I was, and then they switched to Acrobat just as I was learning Quark. I hate computers.
jim_halpert Okay, okay, it's no big deal. So you're not a computer geek.
pam_beesly I have to stay and retake it.
jim_halpert W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
pam_beesly That means another twelve weeks. Can you do this for another three months?
jim_halpert It's not--- It's not about me. I mean, this your dream.
pam_beesly I know.
jim_halpert And you went to New York to do this. So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
pam_beesly Right.
jim_halpert You okay?
pam_beesly Yeah I'm fine. Um... my cell phone battery's low, so I have to let you go.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Alright.
jim_halpert Alright.
pam_beesly Love you. Bye.
jim_halpert Love you too.
michael_scott Guys, she's in there.
andy_bernard Engaging wings
oscar_martinez I'm probably going to leave after one drink.
michael_scott Let's do this.
andy_bernard Yeah with a hot slab of Canadian bacon in your hand.
michael_scott Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again.
concierge_marie Good to see you.
michael_scott Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
oscar_martinez Nice to meet you.

andy_bernard For Madame et monsieur.
michael_scott Oh, thank you.
andy_bernard You're welcome.
michael_scott Thank you, Andy.
concierge_marie Thank you?
andy_bernard Let me get a picture of you guys.
michael_scott Everyone is going to end up dying someday. And I think it's better to die with people you like... like Oscar, and Andy, and concierge Marie... than to know that there's somebody out there that you love that you're not with.
andy_bernard Alright, I've scoped out the joint. Those two dudes are as good as naked.
oscar_martinez How do you even know they're gay?
andy_bernard Come on! It's Dandy Dale and Foppy McGee over there. Mademoiselle! Beer me dos Long Island iced teas s'ill vous plait. Bad decision in a glass.
andy_bernard I don't care if you're gay, straight, engaged... whatever. A guy needs intercourse.
andy_bernard You'll thank me when they spank thee.
oscar_martinez Don't do this.
andy_bernard Do you guys like apples?
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode07 at table What?
andy_bernard Do you like apples?
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode07 at table Uh, sorry... what?
andy_bernard Well, how do you like these apples? Alright, on a scale of 1 - 10, how hot is that dude?
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode07 at table Is he your boyfriend or something?
andy_bernard No, but he could be yours if you play your cards right.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode07 Dude, leave us alone alright?
andy_bernard Gentleman.
oscar_martinez What are you doing?
andy_bernard Dude, you struck out. They're totally stuck up. Here... drink up.
michael_scott How about this one? It's Christmas eve---
concierge_marie Marie Mmm-hmmm...
michael_scott ---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12 00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do? What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
concierge_marie Uh...A stro cleaners on St. Johns place is the only place open on that day.
michael_scott Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
oscar_martinez If you don't mind me asking---
andy_bernard Anything. You can ask me anything.
oscar_martinez Okay.
andy_bernard I'm your wingman.
oscar_martinez Its just that I've sat next to Angela for a very long, very long time.
andy_bernard Right-o.
oscar_martinez How could anyone stand that woman?
andy_bernard What?
oscar_martinez What do you see in her? Wh -- what do you see in Angela?
andy_bernard What do I see in Angela?
oscar_martinez I want to know.
andy_bernard I see through a hard exterior to a little jelly in the middle. She is teaching me to be a better person. And she's working really hard on that. And she has the softest skin I've ever seen and I can't wait to have s*x with her.
oscar_martinez You haven't had s*x?
andy_bernard No.
oscar_martinez Y--Are you guys waiting to get married, or?
andy_bernard Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.
oscar_martinez Andy, something is wrong with that woman.
andy_bernard What is wrong with her?
oscar_martinez I'd like to know. You should call her and ask her. I'd like to know what's wrong with her.
andy_bernard I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?
oscar_martinez Do it! It's a--- Call her! Oh my God, don't call her! Don't call her, Andy. Andy, don't call her!
andy_bernard Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. Shh...
angela_martin Hello? Hello?
andy_bernard What is wrong with you?
oscar_martinez Why won't you do Andy?
angela_martin What?
andy_bernard That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.
angela_martin Are you drunk?
andy_bernard This is Andy Bernard!
angela_martin I know who this is!
andy_bernard I wanna take you to s*x school.
angela_martin What?
dwight_schrute Who is that monkey?

meredith_palmer Pam failed art school.
dwight_schrute Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
jim_halpert Excuse me?
dwight_schrute Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
phyllis_vance Dwight, stop it.
stanley_hudson Dwight.
dwight_schrute What? Are there two suns?
meredith_palmer Come on.
stanley_hudson Oh my God.
dwight_schrute Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
jim_halpert I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
dwight_schrute It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot.
andy_bernard Oscar
oscar_martinez Hey.
andy_bernard That was fun last night.
oscar_martinez Yeah, it was.
andy_bernard You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.
oscar_martinez Hey, um... thanks for trying to hook me up.
andy_bernard You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards.
oscar_martinez I can't believe we called her up.
andy_bernard Totally. What--- Who?
oscar_martinez I'm talking about Angela. I can't believe we called her up last night.
andy_bernard We called Angela?
oscar_martinez You--- you call--- you called her.
andy_bernard That was real?! I thought I dreamed that. Oh, God!
oscar_martinez Alright.
andy_bernard Oh, God!

oscar_martinez Good morning, Michael. Are you ready for the meeting?
michael_scott Slept like a baby.
kelly_kapoor Mmmm.... mmm. This can't happen again.
ryan_howard This has to happen again. Darryl can't happen again. Look at me. Do you want me to do more push-ups?
kelly_kapoor Yeah.
ryan_howard Okay. You have to break up with Darryl. I already typed out a text message for you. All you have to do is press "send".
kelly_kapoor I don't know. I mean, it's well-written and all, I just---
ryan_howard Has to be done. We'll press send together.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God. He's going to kill us.
ryan_howard I'd like to see him try.
kelly_kapoor Oh! He says it's cool. He said, "It's cool".
ryan_howard That's all he wrote?
kelly_kapoor That's all he wrote.
ryan_howard Can I see it?
kelly_kapoor Mmm hmm.
ryan_howard Didn't you two date for like a long time?
kelly_kapoor Mmm hmm. It's like a fairy tale! Mmmm...
potential_canadian_client I'll be honest with you--- we've been talking with Catalyst Paper. Their prices are better than yours.
michael_scott Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings.
potential_canadian_client Everything okay?
michael_scott Yes.
andy_bernard Oh man, she is so pissed.
oscar_martinez Mmm...
andy_bernard She's taking us back to first base.
oscar_martinez What is first base with Angela?
andy_bernard I get to kiss her forehead. I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
oscar_martinez I had a good time too.
andy_bernard Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
oscar_martinez Thank you.
andy_bernard You up for a chest bump?
oscar_martinez No.
andy_bernard Bro hug? Back to basics. I like it.
andy_bernard I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me. And he's delightful!
david_wallace Wallace Hey! I just heard you guys made the sale.
michael_scott Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
david_wallace Wallace Good, very good. See, told you. Sounds like somebody had a good trip.
michael_scott No. Actually the trip sucked.
david_wallace Wallace Excuse me?
michael_scott The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
david_wallace Wallace What are you talking about?
michael_scott I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
david_wallace Wallace Okay.
michael_scott And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
david_wallace Wallace The hotel? What, M--- okay.
michael_scott It was not, it sucked.
david_wallace Wallace I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
michael_scott Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---
david_wallace Walalce Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey.
michael_scott That was a really good choice.
david_wallace Wallcve Michael, please lets listen for a second.
michael_scott No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
david_wallace Wallace Michael, sometimes---
michael_scott That was a really sucky thing to do.
david_wallace Wallace Sometimes, we--
michael_scott Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin for so long? Certainly not because of the paycheck. 'Cause I could be making more money as a doctor or a professional athlete. I think it's because they respect me. A boss that will not fire you, even though you just tell him off... right to his face... over the hone. That's respect.
kevin_malone You did it, man. Day one. Congrats.
jim_halpert Thanks man.
pam_beesly I'm coming back the wrong way. It's not because of you. I don't like graphic design. That's it. Stop smiling. I really didn't like it. It's just designing logos and stuff.... and I miss Scranton. But it is not because I missed you. I just really wanted to come home... and I know you said to come home the right way, but you can't tell me what to do. Got it?
jim_halpert I missed you.
pam_beesly I missed you too.
dwight_schrute You're back.
pam_beesly Uh, yeah.
dwight_schrute Good. I need you to make five copies of these.
pam_beesly I'm not going inside.
dwight_schrute Alright. First thing in the morning then.
jim_halpert Welcome back.
kelly_kapoor We're back together again baby.
ryan_howard We're back.
kelly_kapoor They tried to keep us apart, but they couldnt. It was like destiny.
ryan_howard I--- I realized that for whatever reason I... just couldn't do better than kelly.
kelly_kapoor Oh!
ryan_howard Yeah.
