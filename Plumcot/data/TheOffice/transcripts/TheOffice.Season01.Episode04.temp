dwight Michael!?
michael Oh! God. Dwight, come on.
dwight I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
michael There's no downsizing.
dwight I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
michael Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
dwight Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
michael Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
michael But there's no downsizing, so just don't.
dwight Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
michael Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
michael It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but. blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired. " "You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed. " It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. "You're foir-ed. " I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want. " But that's unrealistic, so.
dwight It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
stanley Why'd you do this?
dwight I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for. maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
michael Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam. Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is. drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
michael Who is it? Who's the birthday?
pam Um. Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.
michael Next person on the.
pam Oh.
michael . calendar.
pam Okay, umm. that would be Meredith.
michael Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
pam But it's not until next month.
michael Um. uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
pam You still want to have a party?
michael Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
michael Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
phyllis Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could. it's stupid, forget it.
angela What?
phyllis I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.
angela No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.
phyllis Yeah?
angela What color do you guys think?
phyllis Well, there's green, um, blue. yellow. red.
pam How about green?
angela I think green is kind of whoreish.
pam This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.
michael These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!
michael So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
angela Meredith's allergic to dairy, so.
michael She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so.
pam It is. her birthday.
michael Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
dwight Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
dwight Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
jim Absolutely, I do.
dwight Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected.
jim At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything dwight does annoys me.
dwight Did you get your tickets?
jim To what?
dwight The gun show.
jim And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, here's a way. "
dwight There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
pam An alliance?
jim Oh yeah.
pam What does that even mean?
jim I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
jim Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
dwight Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the. paper products?
dwight Did you tell pam about the alliance?
jim What? No.
dwight Just now.
jim What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
dwight Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
jim Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
dwight Mmm hmm.
jim But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
dwight Done.
jim All right.
michael Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this. is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. Um, let's see. Jim, jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers. " Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael. "
dwight They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
jim Yeah, what do you think that's about?
dwight Only one way to find out.
jim I'm on it.
jim You are not going to believe this.
dwight What? I believe it.
jim Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
dwight I could tell, from the body language.
jim Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?
kevin Italian.
jim Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone.
kevin Yeah.
jim toby and Kevin, they're trying to get angela kicked off.
dwight Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
jim Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking.
dwight Oh, they're forming an alliance
toby I love their sandwiches.
jim I love their sandwiches too.
kevin Their bread's really good.
jim Their bread is very good.
dwight Damn it. God!
jim OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
dwight God. Damn it! Why us?
jim Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
michael Meredith, Meredith. Meri. Mary had a little lamb. Mary. meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.
michael Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?
oscar Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
michael Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
oscar My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you'd like to. you know. if.
michael What?
oscar Donate to the charity?
michael Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
oscar Thank you.
michael No, I'm always good. for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you. $25.
oscar That's. that's. that's very generous.
michael Oh, my gosh, well. Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into. morale. That's what I say, so.
pam Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?
jim Sure, what's up?
pam Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between michael and corporate about like, staff issues?
jim Oh no?
pam Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, "These people are my friends. " But he's all like, "This is confidential. You can't tell anybody. " But I just feel like I want to. aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.
jim No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
pam OK, yeah.
dwight Jackpot.
jim That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
michael Meredith, bad breath. meredith has bad breath.
dwight Hey, you wanted to see me?
michael Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
dwight I don't think she'd be missed.
michael There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
dwight Name, meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
michael I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
dwight She had a hysterectomy.
michael Which one is that again?
dwight That's where they remove the uterus.
michael Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
dwight It could be kind of funny.
michael You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just. OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time. . push;
jim OK, here's the deal. All right? pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
dwight Oh my God, we have to be there.
jim I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
dwight No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
jim What? What?
dwight I know. I know exactly what to do.
jim Great.
dwight I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are. at vision.
dwight This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
jim Good.
ryan Michael? Are you done yet?
michael Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
jim Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
dwight So tape it down.
jim I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
dwight Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
jim Thank you, thank you. OK.
everybody Surprise!
meredith Oh! Surprise.
angela No, it's ah.
michael It's surprise Meredith. One, two.
everybody Happy birthday to you.
michael Find a key.
everybody Happy birthday.
jim So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
dwight No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
jim Right. That's good.
dwight Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
everybody . birthday, dear meredith Happy birthday to you.
michael And many more!
stanley Last year, five years ago.
michael You were surprised, weren't you?
meredith Yes.
michael You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise. " You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" Good cake. Why don't you have some?
meredith Uh, I can't. Um.
michael Come on. A little bit.
meredith I can't eat dairy.
michael Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
meredith Yeah, it makes me sick.
michael You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.
pam He's in a box?
jim Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
pam Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that.
dwight Oh.
michael Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
jim Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
michael Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
jim Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So. God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
michael Is oscar around?
michael I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know. 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so.
oscar Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.
michael I know.
oscar It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, "However many dollars per mile. "
michael Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um.
oscar I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
michael No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't. No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just. it. it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
oscar Yeah.
michael How many miles did he do last year?
oscar Last year, he walked 18 miles.
michael Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
pam Happy Birthday.
michael Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
meredith "Happy Bird-day" Um. "Meredith, good news. You're not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still. "
michael I don't know about that.
meredith That was Stanley. "Meredith, happy birthday, you're the best. Love, Pam. "
michael Huh! Thanks, downer.
meredith This is from Michael. "Meredith, let's hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age. "
michael Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
meredith No, I. I get it. It's funny.
michael You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually. I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um. Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um. "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back. " 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
meredith You're right. You're right. Yes.
michael Divorce. Um. OK, "meredith is so old. "
oscar How old is she?
michael Everybody? If. could do it? "meredith is so old. "
everybody How old is she?
michael "She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her. "
michael That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
oscar Uh, nice party Michael.
michael This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that.
angela phyllis wanted red, I didn't.
phyllis Oh, boy. You.
michael OK, we. all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are. a group of people. who work together. I was. I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's. walkathon. $25.
oscar Per mile.
michael Per mile, yes.
michael When I retire, I. don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.
michael A check for the kids, and for the team.
michael I want it to be like. "Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?" "Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous. " "Well, guess what, that was michael Scott. " "But it was anonymous, how do you know?" "Because I'm him. "
oscar Thank you, Michael.
michael Come here. Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
toby Really? Today?
ryan Yeah.
toby Oh, Happy Birthday.
ryan Thanks.
toby Yeah, I could say something.
ryan No, don't. Don't do that.
jim OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.
pam Oh, tell me, tell me.
jim OK. I have just convinced dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and. . spy on our other branch. No no no.
jim But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
pam That's perfect!
jim If we can get him to drive to Connecticut. and put peroxide in his hair.
roy What the hell is this? What are you trying to cop a feel or something? Huh Halpert?
jim No, no, dude, no.
pam Hey, Hey!
jim No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
pam Come on.
jim God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um. Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um. um. we were. we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um.
pam It's just office pranks.
jim It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
roy An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
dwight I have absolutely no idea.
roy Come on.
dwight Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
dwight That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
