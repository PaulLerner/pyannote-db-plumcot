dwight_schrute Last week I gave a fire safety talk. And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. Today, smoking is gonna save lives.
dwight_schrute Does anyone smell anything smoky?
angela_martin Did you bring your jerky in again?
dwight_schrute
pam_beesly Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!
phyllis_vance What--
andy_bernard Whoa, fire!
dwight_schrute Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people?
pam_beesly The phones are dead.
dwight_schrute Oh, how did that happen?
kevin_malone It's out in the hall.
dwight_schrute No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
michael_scott Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm.
dwight_schrute What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
michael_scott Stay calm!
dwight_schrute Wait, wait, wait.
michael_scott Everyone, now calm down!
dwight_schrute No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
michael_scott What does warm mean?
all@ Oh my God.
dwight_schrute Not a viable option.
pam_beesly Try a different door.
dwight_schrute Okay, what's next?
michael_scott Don't run.
dwight_schrute Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle?
andy_bernard It-- it's warm.
dwight_schrute Well, uh, another option.
jim_halpert Back door.
dwight_schrute Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!
phyllis_vance Oh! I forgot my purse.
stanley_hudson Leave it woman!
michael_scott Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
dwight_schrute Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
oscar_martinez Ah! My hand! That's hot!
andy_bernard Aah! This ones hot too!
michael_scott Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself.
dwight_schrute Okay, let's go.
all@ Out of my way! Let's go. Get out of my way!
dwight_schrute Calm, please
andy_bernard Get out of the way!
dwight_schrute Have you ever seen a burn victim?
andy_bernard Move it!
dwight_schrute Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
angela_martin It's okay. Shh shhh.
dwight_schrute A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people.
angela_martin Oscar.
dwight_schrute What's next?
angela_martin Oscar!
oscar_martinez Stay alive! I'm getting help!
angela_martin Pull me up!
oscar_martinez You're too heavy!
angela_martin I only weigh 82 pounds! Uh-- save Bandit! Oh!
dwight_schrute How about 911? Anyone? 911.
pam_beesly What do we do?
dwight_schrute Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
jim_halpert Okay, I am not dying here. Come on.
angela_martin What is that? What is that?
andy_bernard The fire's shooting at us!
phyllis_vance What in the name of God is going on?!
andy_bernard Yes! Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!
phyllis_vance and Creed Ahhhh!!!
andy_bernard Go, go, go, go, go!!
michael_scott Help!! Help!!
stanley_hudson I'm about to die!
dwight_schrute Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.
jim_halpert What?!
dwight_schrute Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise. So, what have we learned? Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
michael_scott No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
jim_halpert No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!
michael_scott He's going to swallow is tongue.
jim_halpert No. Michael. Michael.
michael_scott Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.
jim_halpert Michael! Michael!
michael_scott Leave me al--
andy_bernard You're choking him!
michael_scott Saving him!
david_wallace Wallace How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
dwight_schrute A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
michael_scott Electricity.
dwight_schrute Shampoo.
david_wallace Wallace You could have burned down the whole building.
dwight_schrute I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
Lawyer#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Did you shout, "Fire!", causing a panic?
dwight_schrute Yes I shouted "fire!". I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
michael_scott Hed. Hedded
dwight_schrute When no one hedded--
michael_scott Take hedded of.
dwight_schrute N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
michael_scott Heed. Heed.
dwight_schrute So, you--
michael_scott Take heed of.
dwight_schrute And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
michael_scott Take heed of.
dwight_schrute Hee-heeding this right now.
Lawyer#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Wh--what?
michael_scott Okay. This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
david_wallace Wallace No, we are mad.
michael_scott Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.
david_wallace Wallace No, we're not.
michael_scott I am not a mind reader, David.
david_wallace Look, this is very serious offense. We have cause to fire you.
michael Can you shove down? Instead... shove down, please. Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.
dwight_schrute PETA.
david_wallace Wallace Michael, you have to take responsibility here. One of your employees had a heart attack. He could have died, because of the way that you are allowing your office to run. Do you want that on your conscious?
michael_scott Do you?
david_wallace Wallace Michael?
michael_scott You talking to me?
david_wallace Wallace Yeah.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
michael_scott No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.
dwight_schrute Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay?
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
michael_scott That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
dwight_schrute What? You?
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Come on.
michael_scott I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.
dwight_schrute That's preposterous.
michael_scott No, I will.
michael_scott Nobody should have to go to work thinking, "Oh, this is the place that I might die today." That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying. An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.
michael_scott Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. Welcome back, Stanley.
stanley_hudson Thank you, Michael.
stanley_hudson It's true. Around this office, in the past, I have been a little abrupt with people...
stanley_hudson Not maybe. Yes or no.
stanley_hudson No way. Uh-uh.
stanley_hudson Are you from another planet?
stanley_hudson Boy, have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it.
stanley_hudson Did I stutter?
stanley_hudson I'm done. Goodbye.
stanley_hudson But the doctor said if I can't find a new way to relate more positively to my surroundings I'm going to die.
michael_scott Andy.
andy_bernard A throne for your highness.
stanley_hudson I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.
michael_scott No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
stanley_hudson I'm going to die.
CPR#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 trainer A-B-C. Okay? And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation.
michael_scott Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing."
dwight_schrute This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
michael_scott Shut it. Shut it.
michael_scott We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do. So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.
kevin_malone I can't keep doing this forever.
CPR#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Trainer It's been 20 seconds.
kevin_malone Call it.
CPR#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Trainer Would you like to try next?
dwight_schrute Absolutely I would not.
michael_scott You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
stanley_hudson Oh, I don't know.
phyllis_vance That's not a good idea, Michael.
michael_scott Come on.
phyllis_vance He needs to rest.
michael_scott No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
stanley_hudson I would die.
michael_scott And you're okay with that?
stanley_hudson I'm okay with the logic of it.
michael_scott Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this.
stanley_hudson Yes. I had a heart attack. I would quit, but I'm too old to find another job and I don't have enough saved to retire. I feel like I'm working in my own casket.
michael_scott Come on Stanley. You're losing you. You're losing you. Do it!
angela_martin Michael!
michael_scott This is you we're talking about.
angela_martin Michael.
michael_scott Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go. Stanley. All right.
CPR#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Trainer So, assessing the situation. Are they breathing?
michael_scott No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs.
rose No, that's not part of it.
michael_scott Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
kevin_malone I would want to live with no legs.
michael_scott How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
rose All right, well, lets get back to it. 'Cause you're losing him. Okay, too fast. Everyone, we need to pump at a pace of a 100 beats per minute .
michael_scott okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?
jim_halpert How's that gonna help you?
michael_scott I will divide and then count to it.
jim_halpert Right.
rose Okay. Well, a good trick is to pump to the tune of 'Staying Alive' by the Bee Gees. Do you know that song?
michael_scott Yes, yes I do. I love that song. First I was afraid, I was petrified.
rose No, it's--Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
michael_scott Okay, I got it.
creed_bratton You were in the parking lot earlier. That's how I know you.
michael_scott Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
michael_scott Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...
andy_bernard Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, you can look the other way. Loo do do!
rose Okay!
andy_bernard Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
rose Okay!
all@ Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
rose Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.
dwight_schrute Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
rose I have no idea.
dwight_schrute Anyone else?
phyllis_vance We bury him?
dwight_schrute Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
creed_bratton He has no wallet, I checked.
michael_scott He is an organ donor.
dwight_schrute He is.
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. Here we go.
angela_martin Oh my God! Dwight!
kelly_kapoor Dwight!
angela_martin What are you-- What are you doing?
dwight_schrute We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
stanley_hudson I'm not feeling well. I need to sit down.
michael_scott Hey, Stanley.
andy_bernard Stanley.
michael_scott Are you okay?
angela_martin Oh my God!
stanley_hudson Oh my God!
angela_martin Dwight!
dwight_schrute Clarice?
stanley_hudson Oh my God!
david_wallace Wallace Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
dwight_schrute I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
david_wallace Wallace We had to pay for it. Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
michael_scott Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
dwight_schrute Wow.
michael_scott Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
andy_bernard Hope you brought your appetitos. My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. Uh, damn it. This movie, a lot of buzz. Not coming out for another six months. Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.
pam_beesly We don't normally download films illegally. Because we're honest, hardworking people.
jim_halpert And we don't know how.
pam_beesly But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.
jim_halpert Punishment fits the crime.
Jessica#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Alba I want you to meet my nana. Nana...
lily_hanaday Mmmhmm...
Jessica#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Alba This is Sam.
sam Hi. Nice to meet you Mrs. Hannaday.
lily_hanaday Please-- Call me Lily. Let's play Bridge. You can be my partner.
sam Alright... Lily.
jim_halpert What's going on?
jim_halpert Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
pam_beesly My dad spent the night at our place last night. My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks. Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.
pam_beesly He's not saying what he needs to say.
andy_bernard Hmm? Who? Sam?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert I mean, they just need to communicate, you know? If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
andy_bernard Hmm.
andy_bernard Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.
michael_scott Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
dwight_schrute I have.
michael_scott Let's hear it.
dwight_schrute "I state my regret."
jim_halpert You couldn't of memorized that?
dwight_schrute I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
phyllis_vance It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
dwight_schrute Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!
pam_beesly Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
lily_hanaday I'm in here.
sam I uh, I'm sorry I didn't uh, realize you were in a bath. Do you want me to go?
lily_hanaday I want you to stay.
jim_halpert Gimme a break.
andy_bernard I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.
sam Get that in there. Oh yeah.
lily_hanaday Get that done already.
sam I know but if I get it in deeper...
jim_halpert Can you believe this? He was pretty talkative at breakfast.
andy_bernard Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
pam_beesly So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?
andy_bernard You guys, they're making out.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?
jim_halpert Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
pam_beesly
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
jim_halpert Mmm...
pam_beesly You're good to talk to.
jim_halpert I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um...
michael_scott Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
michael_scott My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...
michael_scott It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
jim_halpert Don't open your eyes.
pam_beesly What? Oh...
michael_scott And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
meredith_palmer Chunky monkey.
michael_scott Too expensive.
stanley_hudson Chocolate.
michael_scott Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
stanley_hudson It's my bio-feedback machine..
michael_scott Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
stanley_hudson It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
michael_scott You have stress?
stanley_hudson Yes...
michael_scott During our relaxation exercise?
phyllis_vance Let me get you some water.
michael_scott No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
stanley_hudson No, Michael, No.
michael_scott Let me getcha.
stanley_hudson Would ya, would ya step back please
michael_scott Ok, alright.
stanley_hudson Please. A little further.
michael_scott Ok.
stanley_hudson That's better.
michael_scott Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? Let's give this a shot.
michael_scott Hellloo...
kevin_malone Michael, I think you're what's stressing everybody out.
michael_scott So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?
pam_beesly What did you say to my dad?
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.
jim_halpert Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again.
jim_halpert Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...
pam_beesly What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?
michael_scott I don't get it. Do I stress you out?
dwight_schrute Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
michael_scott Oh...
dwight_schrute Speaking of which...
michael_scott Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
michael_scott Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...
kelly_kapoor A vacation.
michael_scott What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...
oscar_martinez Michael are you serious? You really want us to roast you?
michael_scott Si senor.
oscar_martinez That's offensive.
michael_scott It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
kevin_malone Oh my GOD... Oh man... Ohhhhh my God...
oscar_martinez I consider myself a good person. But I'm gonna try to make him cry.
michael_scott I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.
dwight_schrute May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
phyllis_vance Hey, this is your apology letter.
dwight_schrute That was the last signature I needed.
michael_scott Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
angela_martin If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott.
angela_martin I normally don't enjoy making people laugh.
angela_martin If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
all@ Michael Scott!
michael_scott Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
kelly_kapoor I have made a list of people that I would make out with before I would make out with Michael Scott. A turtle, a fridge, anybody from the warehouse, a woodchipper, Kevin, a candle, and Lord Voldemort. Anyway, Happy Birthday Michael.
michael_scott You're so lucky! Good one...
meredith_palmer Michael? You ran over me with your car. You posted a picture of my bare boobs on the bulletin board with a caption that said "Gross"...
michael_scott Well...
meredith_palmer Michael, you are the reason I drink. You are the reason I live to forget.
michael_scott Pow pow pow...
oscar_martinez
michael_scott NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY.
jim_halpert Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.
michael_scott I know where this is goin'.
jim_halpert Do ya?
michael_scott No...
jim_halpert Ok. Remember Spider face?
michael_scott No.
jim_halpert OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
michael_scott Spite her - ok
jim_halpert Yeah... yep.
dwight_schrute How dare you all attack him like this.
michael_scott Oh, stop it Dwight.
dwight_schrute Michael is your superior.
michael_scott No no no no no no!
dwight_schrute Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
michael_scott Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
dwight_schrute Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
michael_scott That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
dwight_schrute You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
michael_scott Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
dwight_schrute Are you calling me an idiot?
michael_scott Idiot.
dwight_schrute Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land.
pam_beesly Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.
michael_scott Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
pam_beesly Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle!
michael_scott Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
darryl_philbin Mike claims, we're all a family isn't that right?
michael_scott We are, we are a family.
darryl_philbin Ok, so um, what's his name? All the way in the back there.
michael_scott Oh very funny.
darryl_philbin What's his name?
michael_scott Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
darryl_philbin Roy left years ago. What's his name?
michael_scott I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
Warehouse#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode13 Michael Michael I gave you a ride home last week, we spent an hour in traffic...
darryl_philbin What's his name?
michael_scott Jefferson.
darryl_philbin Nope. His name is Michael.
andy_bernard What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss, you're the laziest, jerkiest and you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away, heeey, well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you. Yeah. And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.
michael_scott Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought sorry. I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um...
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.
dwight_schrute It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
kevin_malone He is so dumb that he tries to put his M&Ms in alphabetical order.
oscar_martinez Alright Kevin. Enough with the Michael jokes. I think he got it bad enough yesterday.
kevin_malone I'm almost done.
oscar_martinez That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.
dwight_schrute Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
jim_halpert Yep. You're being replaced.
pam_beesly I think he meant personal day.
dwight_schrute Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
phyllis_vance I hope he's ok, I feel bad.
creed_bratton Give it up, he's dead.
jim_halpert He just sent a text...
creed_bratton What's a text?
michael_scott Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
michael_scott You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. I'm okay. No, I'm not.
pam_beesly Phyllis there's a package for you.
phyllis_vance Oh, ok.
dwight_schrute Got it.
lily_hanaday Sam, Sam Sam. It's not that you dumped my granddaughter, and its not that you want children. It, it's that you lied to me. Can't you see that? Can't you see? Oh, I can never trust you.
sam Lilly no. Lilly! Lilly please! Lilly STOP! I don't care how much time we have left. I don't care what my friends say! And I don't care what your mom thinks! Frankly I'm pretty sure she's not makin any sense. Please. Move back to my apartment. Lilly. I'm not giving up. I'm not giving up. Lilly... Lilly! Push the reverse button! Reverse the button!
andy_bernard Sam! Sam!
pam_beesly Hey Dad. No I know, Mom told me. Ok. Yeah I'll see ya then.
jim_halpert So what did he say? Was it my fault?
pam_beesly Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.
jim_halpert You ok?
pam_beesly Yeah.
pam_beesly When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them.
andy_bernard I am not insightful enough to be a movie critic. Mm... maybe I could be a food critic. These muffins taste bad. Hmm, or an art critic. That painting is bad.
pam_beesly Michael! It's really good to see you.
dwight_schrute Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
jim_halpert Are you alright?
oscar_martinez Michael, I feel like I was a little harsh yesterday.
michael_scott I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
pam_beesly What?
michael_scott Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela? Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during s*x and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are... Oscar, you're gay.
oscar_martinez Wow.
michael_scott Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe.
michael_scott They say that laughter is the best medicine so Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you should... better hold onto them pills, just in case.
