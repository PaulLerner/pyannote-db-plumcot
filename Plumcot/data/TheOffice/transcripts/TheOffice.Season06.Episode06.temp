michael The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.
toby Well the "fun" is in it.
michael Get out.
toby Yeah, I know.
michael Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk. " What topics can you use for small talk?
andy Golf.
michael Mmhm.
andy Stock market.
michael Mmhm.
andy Dave Matthews.
michael Yes, what else?
creed Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes.
michael No.
meredith The weekend!
michael Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
meredith Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
michael All right.
meredith He calls it an upper decker.
michael Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.
ryan Then do it.
michael What?
ryan Write a book.
michael The fundamentals of business by michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman.
erin Mr. Grotti, this is michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
michael Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
erin In your schedule it just says nine til noon is "creative space" and I thought this could be part of that.
michael Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
erin You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says "free play. "
michael Push free play til tomorrow morning. Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
grotti Ah.
michael Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
grotti As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.
michael Mmhm.
grotti But you also got a lot of responsibility
michael Yep.
grotti None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.
michael Okay.
michael There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
kevin Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
andy What do you think?
dwight I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
grotti God forbid you. should have a fire in the warehouse.
michael Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
grotti Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury.
michael Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
grotti You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.
michael Okay, well.
grotti I can be very very persistent.
michael Do your worst.
michael Oh, great.
grotti Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?
michael Mmhm.
andy What happened in there?
michael Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
dwight Did he threaten you?
michael No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
andy Mobsters are!
michael There is no such things as monsters.
andy He drives an SUV!
dwight I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
oscar Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
dwight No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
michael Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
andy All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.
oscar For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
michael I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
andy Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!
dwight Exactly.
michael He did talk about a fire in the warehouse. and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
oscar Uhh. All right, who else is here?
oscar pam and jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between "sane and others. " toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The "coalition for reason" is extremely weak.
toby oscar says I checked out huh? Huh.
michael Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
ryan Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia. '
michael Okay.
ryan What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
michael Um it is, Grotti. andy and
dwight Oh no. Fabulous.
oscar What? What?
andy It's John Gotti, you idiot!
oscar It's, it's a completely different name!
phyllis So he won't get caught!
andy Yeah. It's pretty close.
oscar No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
dwight No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder. " And not "muck-duck. "
michael Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
dwight Lock your door!
michael I'm not gonna lock my door.
jim Hello?
oscar Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
jim Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
oscar It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
jim Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-
pam Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
oscar Pam, I'm sorry--
pam Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
oscar You're right. You're right. Oh, okay bye.
michael It's Grotti. He's following up.
andy Already? This, this guy is persistent!
michael "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business. "
dwight That's bad.
michael Yeah.
dwight That's bad.
michael Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
andy Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
michael Okay, I'm calling the police.
andy That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
dwight He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
michael All right.
andy Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
michael Shh!
dwight You know what?
michael That's not gonna happen.
dwight That's an exaggeration.
andy That's how it works!
michael What am I supposed to do here?
andy When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
michael I was thinking exactly the same thing.
dwight No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
andy Dwight.
dwight The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
michael I don't know, I don't know about that.
andy Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
dwight Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
andy Okay.
dwight Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
andy I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
michael Hold on, hold on! Just-
andy No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
michael All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.
andy Well you're gonna have to.
dwight We'll be right beside you.
andy What?
michael What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
andy Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
dwight Do you know how to use it?
andy To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.
michael Let's go, come on. God!
andy Should I change?
dwight You're wearing loafers!
michael Forget it! Forget it!
michael Take that thing off the table! Please!
andy Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
dwight Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
andy Oh! God!
michael Oh my God!
dwight You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
michael Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
michael Hello.
grotti Mr. Scott.
michael Mr. grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
grotti Hi. Angelo Grotti.
andy Hi.
dwight Hello.
grotti So, you got this table?
michael Yes.
grotti This is one of those half booths, can't-decide-what-it-is type of thing.
michael Well.
grotti Waitress, we're gonna sit over here.
waitress That's fine.
michael Okay. . push;
kevin Hello. Credit card
rep Hello Mr. Halpert. I'm calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card.
kevin Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
rep First would you mind verifying your home address?
kevin Um, yes. Um, 383 Linden Ave, Scranton PA
rep And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number?
kevin Six-six-five-zero.
rep Well Mr. Halpert. You're obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico.
kevin Wait a minute. Yes I am.
rep I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card.
kevin No. That. I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
rep Very funny sir. We'll get a new card out to you right away.
kevin No-
rep Have a nice day, and thank you!
kevin Shoot.
grotti If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.
dwight Oh he's not that nice.
michael That's not true.
andy Hmm. Very true.
michael Okay shut up.
waitress Have you decided?
grotti Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back.
waitress Okay then. And for you sir?
michael I will have the gabba-gool.
waitress The. what?
michael The gabba-gool.
waitress I don't really know what that is.
andy You know, gabba-gool.
michael I don't, I don't have to have that.
dwight What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
michael Guys, guys-
waitress I don't really think that we have that.
michael That's okay.
dwight Bring him the gabba-gool!
michael Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
waitress Okay.
michael If the salad is on top, I send it back.
oscar Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
kevin I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
oscar This constitutes identity fraud.
kevin Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
oscar What's that supposed to mean?
kevin Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail.
oscar Why would I love jail?
kevin Because. You would love it.
michael I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
grotti Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you.
andy Maybe we have a plan for you?
grotti How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and Think about it.
woman Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic?
andy Yeeeeah.
woman My battery is dead, I've got my kid, can you please help?
andy Yes I can.
michael No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.
grotti Come on! Lady in distress? Go! Go!
andy Okay!
woman Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.
michael Hey, do you need any help?
grotti I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down.
michael He's a good mechanic.
grotti Where were we?
michael I don't.
dwight He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
michael Okay, okay okay.
dwight So we're choosing.
michael Yep, all right.
dwight Check out Dental?
michael Put it down.
andy Black goes on the red. With the. If we. Positive. Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
kid He seems bad at this.
andy You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the. mechanic store. Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube.
woman What?!?
andy So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles.
grotti Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. You okay, Pat?
andy Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
grotti Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?
andy It was before, my tech- my technical training.
dwight Don't do it!
andy Do it.
dwight Don't.
andy Just do it.
michael Okay.
grotti Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?
dwight Yes.
michael Okay.
dwight I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
michael It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
andy You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
michael I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
dwight It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
michael It was a lot of snap decisions.
dwight Do you know what "snap decision" means?
michael Yes!
dwight It means like this.
michael Just get in the car.
jim Hello?
michael Jim?
jim Michael?
michael Oh thank God.
jim How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
michael It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
jim That sounds bad.
michael Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
jim I'm gonna help you through it all right?
michael Okay!
jim All you're gonna need to and- it- and then go to--
michael Jim? Are you?
jim And then you'll be saved.
michael What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
jim Just and then you'll be saved.
michael No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
jim A- ah--
michael No! Oh my God!
jim And you'll be saved.
michael No, jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!
jim I at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again.
michael Jim?!? Oh my God.
michael Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
oscar Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
michael Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
oscar Just- no. No.
michael All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
dwight We have let michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
andy He's alive. So you're welcome.
dwight Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
andy Yeah, some of that existed before.
dwight Not the living in fear, that's new.
andy You're right, that is new.
dwight Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
andy Well I don't see that happening.
dwight Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
andy Are you saying-
dwight Yeah.
andy That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
dwight What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing michael that the guy's not mafia!
andy That seems a little far-fetched.
dwight Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.
dwight Michael. Incredible news. grotti is clean.
michael No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
andy No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean.
dwight It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
andy Class act. Boy scout.
michael But grotti acts like he's mafia though.
andy He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
dwight And he made us all look like chumps!
michael 
michael If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
grotti This is Grotti.
michael This is Scott.
grotti Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now.
michael Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
grotti I, I thought you'd be pleased.
michael Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
grotti What?
michael I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
grotti I don't get it. How was I scaring you?
michael I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
andy Whoa. Okay.
michael You suck!
dwight Okay that's-
michael And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
dwight That's good, let's wrap it up.
michael How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
grotti Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call?
michael Doubt it. dwight and
andy Oh man.
michael What a tool. What?
andy Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
michael No. What do you mean?
dwight We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
michael What?
dwight You successfully backed down the mob!
andy You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
michael Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
michael So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead. " I said something like that.
dwight Very close.
oscar Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
michael Erin?
erin Yes?
michael Coffee?
erin Okay.
michael Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
erin Okay.
michael Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
erin How do you return coffee?
michael Go. Any questions?
pam Are you kidding me?
kevin Hi Pam, is jim there?
pam Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
kevin Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
pam Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
kevin Cool. Okay. Bye.
kevin They have no idea what happened.
