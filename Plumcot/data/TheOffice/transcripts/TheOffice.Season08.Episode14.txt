jim_halpert Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.
pam_beesly Hey guys!
all@ Hey.
pam_beesly Hi.
andy_bernard Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!
phyllis_vance Are you glad to be back?
pam_beesly Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.
stanley_hudson You still had eight weeks more than we did.
pam_beesly Well, it's not exactly a vacation.
angela_martin Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
dwight_schrute What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
angela_martin I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave.
pam_beesly What?!
kelly_kapoor Damn girl! Your body!
oscar_martinez Angela, you look amazing.
angela_martin Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
all@
pam_beesly Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
kevin_malone Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
pam_beesly Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
angela_martin I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
pam_beesly When did you find time to do all this?
angela_martin Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
pam_beesly Thank you. Oh my gosh. It's really good.
angela_martin I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
pam_beesly So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-
jim_halpert Nope. It's over.
pam_beesly ...we wanted to say thank you-
jim_halpert Nope. OK.
andy_bernard Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
dwight_schrute What?
andy_bernard I think you're going to like it.
dwight_schrute You can't tantalize me.
andy_bernard Oooh, maybe I can. I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
dwight_schrute OK.
andy_bernard That... you got a promotion! Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
dwight_schrute If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
andy_bernard No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
dwight_schrute Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
dwight_schrute The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, "perfect pork anus" which I don't mean.
erin_hannon And here's the fax for you.
andy_bernard And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
erin_hannon Ah! Love to learn.
andy_bernard Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.
erin_hannon So...
andy_bernard Uh yeah, look at that.
erin_hannon We're pin twins.
andy_bernard Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
erin_hannon Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too.
erin_hannon For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
darryl_philbin What do we have here?
darryl_philbin Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a "we're just friends" beanie or a "I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
dwight_schrute Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
pam_beesly Really?
dwight_schrute Mm hm.
pam_beesly I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
jim_halpert Ooh, me three.
dwight_schrute Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
pam_beesly Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
dwight_schrute God, you're such a spy.
darryl_philbin Notice anything different about me?
val You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
darryl_philbin Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
nate I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
darryl_philbin Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
val I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
darryl_philbin Oh, this is a gift, for....my man Nate here.
nate What?
darryl_philbin Yeah.
nate Darryl, you shouldn't have.
darryl_philbin Hey.
nate Can I open it?
darryl_philbin No, no, no. Maybe just later.
nate Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. Darryl.
val Wow. Those are really nice.
nate They're so elegant.
val Cashmere.
nate How'd you know?
darryl_philbin Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
val Can't wait.
nate "I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day." Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
dwight_schrute My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
cathy_simms Kathy.
dwight_schrute Kathy.
jim_halpert I just got a text from Robert California that says "bring your clubs to Florida".
pam_beesly Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
jim_halpert I hope not. Because I am not going. Two question marks?
pam_beesly No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
andy_bernard You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
dwight_schrute Yes.
andy_bernard Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
dwight_schrute Oh my god.
andy_bernard They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
dwight_schrute Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
andy_bernard Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
dwight_schrute Oh god.
andy_bernard You have your team.
dwight_schrute Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
pam_beesly Well, let's hear it.
jim_halpert "Robert, Hey!" Exclamation point.
pam_beesly I like it so far.
jim_halpert "Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA" Dash JH.
pam_beesly It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
jim_halpert Yeah, it's a golf text.
pam_beesly Total golf text. Send it.
jim_halpert Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
kelly_kapoor You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
darryl_philbin This is Darryl.
robert_california Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers.
darryl_philbin Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
robert_california Yeah, do you know her?
darryl_philbin We're friends. We're friends.
robert_california Cool. Um, so can I get that address or...?
darryl_philbin Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
robert_california Why do you need a pen?
darryl_philbin Back off! I got my reasons.
dwight_schrute May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
kelly_kapoor Why?
dwight_schrute Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
kelly_kapoor Hell yeah.
stanley_hudson What?!
dwight_schrute Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
meredith_palmer Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
oscar_martinez It just feels like a slap in the face.
dwight_schrute I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
oscar_martinez We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
dwight_schrute I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
kevin_malone Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
dwight_schrute Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
ryan_howard What are the criteria for going?
dwight_schrute It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
andy_bernard Mooshie mooshie.
dwight_schrute Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
andy_bernard Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.
stanley_hudson Respect it? You're trying to tell me Kevin Malone deserves more than Stanley Hudson.
kevin_malone Hey!
angela_martin Ok, it's obvious Andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
kelly_kapoor Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
angela_martin My baby is not a monster!
dwight_schrute Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
andy_bernard Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
ryan_howard Stop calling us "guys".
andy_bernard I use the word "guys" a lot when I'm nervous...guys.
andy_bernard Guys! Guys! Guys!
all@ Stop it!
andy_bernard Guys..
ryan_howard Stop. Stop it Andy.
oscar_martinez ...Andy.
andy_bernard Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
dwight_schrute OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
andy_bernard Wha-
stanley_hudson If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
andy_bernard OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
dwight_schrute Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
andy_bernard No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
kelly_kapoor For you maybe.
andy_bernard Five to six hours?
dwight_schrute Three to four hours.
andy_bernard No no no no.
dwight_schrute Two to three hours...
andy_bernard Nope.
dwight_schrute Come up with a statement in the next hour....
andy_bernard Thirty minutes!
creed_bratton I'm out.
pam_beesly Ok, read it back to me.
jim_halpert Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
pam_beesly Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.
erin_hannon Absolutely. Works for me.
jim_halpert Ok, sending.
pam_beesly Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
jim_halpert Really did He responded L-O-L.
erin_hannon
phyllis_vance I have a new swimsuit I need to break in....
meredith_palmer I am...
dwight_schrute I have already picked my team Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
ryan_howard You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and Kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
andy_bernard Or both?
ryan_howard Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put Ryan Howard on your special project team...or Kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
andy_bernard Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
dwight_schrute Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
kevin_malone Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
dwight_schrute Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
andy_bernard Thank you.
kevin_malone When do we leave?
andy_bernard Thank you.
toby_flenderson It has been a long, lonely winter.
dwight_schrute Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
toby_flenderson It is real, thank you for saying that.
andy_bernard Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
stanley_hudson Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
dwight_schrute Maybe it's what she does here...
andy_bernard Well...
erin_hannon Hey guys, any spots left?
andy_bernard Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?
erin_hannon I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
dwight_schrute You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
erin_hannon Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
andy_bernard Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..
erin_hannon Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
jim_halpert Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
pam_beesly I think you need to go to Florida.
jim_halpert I think you're right.
pam_beesly It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..
jim_halpert Total nightmare.
pam_beesly I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
jim_halpert Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
pam_beesly Exactly.
dwight_schrute Well, No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
andy_bernard Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
dwight_schrute I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
jim_halpert You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
dwight_schrute Jim is essential to th-
jim_halpert Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.
dwight_schrute Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
jim_halpert Essential.
dwight_schrute This is stupid! Cut.
jim_halpert Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
dwight_schrute He doesn't even want to go.
jim_halpert Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
dwight_schrute Oh my god.
jim_halpert Hey, quick question Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
andy_bernard OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida Kathy..
dwight_schrute What?
andy_bernard ....Stanley..
dwight_schrute No.
andy_bernard ...Ryan...
dwight_schrute No!
andy_bernard ...Erin...
dwight_schrute
andy_bernard ...And, Jim.
dwight_schrute You've gotta be -ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
dwight_schrute Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
stanley_hudson Why is it so hot in here?
dwight_schrute Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
ryan_howard But...
dwight_schrute But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
ryan_howard No no, I want to go.
dwight_schrute Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.
jim_halpert Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
dwight_schrute SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
dwight_schrute How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
stanley_hudson How did a mosquito get in here?
dwight_schrute I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes.
dwight_schrute Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, oh. What was that?
jim_halpert Mosquito.
dwight_schrute Orientation is over.
nate Oh Darryl, hey.
darryl_philbin Hey what's up? You called?
nate Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything...
darryl_philbin It's cool really.
nate No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes.
darryl_philbin "This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack"
nate Yeah, they're Nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.
darryl_philbin Thanks. Nice flowers.
val Thanks, they're from my mom.
darryl_philbin Your mom?
val Yeah.
darryl_philbin Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
val Yeah, that's her.
darryl_philbin She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
val Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
darryl_philbin Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
dwight_schrute Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.
erin_hannon I'm going to Florida.....and I'm not coming back.
dwight_schrute So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
jim_halpert So, what is this special project?
dwight_schrute Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
jim_halpert That sounds awesome.
dwight_schrute It did, it did.
ryan_howard You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
erin_hannon Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
dwight_schrute Oh, I like it.
ryan_howard It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question is How do we make this a better party?
dwight_schrute No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
ryan_howard Right. Think different, from Apple.
jim_halpert Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
dwight_schrute Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
dwight_schrute I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
kelly_kapoor I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
ryan_howard Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
kelly_kapoor Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
ryan_howard No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
pam_beesly Alright
jim_halpert Bye.
pam_beesly Bye. Call me when you land.
jim_halpert I will.
andy_bernard Safe travels.
erin_hannon Goodbye for a very very long time.
andy_bernard Oh, K. It's only three weeks.
cathy_simms All expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do?
