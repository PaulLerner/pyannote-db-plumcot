monster Oscar, toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I'm sitting on them.
andy This is awesome!
oscar Thank you. It didn't even take that long. Cookie
monster What's the difference between a chimichanga, a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It's urgent.
kevin This isn't funny. I don't talk like that.
phyllis Say "Me eat cookie. "
kevin No. I won't say it.
dwight Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
ryan It's kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
dwight Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
phyllis Mm-hmm.
dwight I love that show. Cookie
monster This is Kevin. This is Kevin.
ryan Good work, buddy.

dwight That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
oscar Yes.
kelly Me, too Oscar.
ryan C. C. me
kevin Angela, this is inappropriate.
angela This is my favorite day.
andy It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. . Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a Stern reminder via fax at 7
 00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
meredith Here you go.
erin Oh, thank you.
andy I do.
dwight 
erin Thank you.
andy If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
erin Welcome back!
pam Hey, thanks.
pam It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?. It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
pam Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
jim I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
dwight Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
pam It's nice to see you again, Dwight. Dwight.
 Hello, Pam.
andy I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
michael I'm going to give erin $15.
erin I know that erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
michael A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
andy Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. .
michael She's kind of a rube.
andy That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
michael Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
andy She's gonna be so psyched.
michael Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
erin Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
michael I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to. lunch.
erin I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
michael Ugh.
erin Just the two of us.
michael Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm.
erin Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but.
michael Okay, well, we'll figure something.
erin Oh.
michael Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
erin Okay.
michael All right.
meredith Have a cookie, Kev.
kevin Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
darryl I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
kevin Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. Happy Birthday.
darryl Thank you.
darryl Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
kevin They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
kevin Oscar, did you eat some of my M&amp;M's? The level.
gabe This is violent and offensive.
kevin Thank you. It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
gabe It's awful.
kevin I'm not crying.
gabe You have some food on your face.
kevin Do my hands feel sweaty to you?
gabe The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I. T. guy. This Cookie monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
gabe Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
kevin Yeah.
gabe And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
michael Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
erin I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
michael I don't know.
erin I would have chosen the 1490's.
michael Ahhh.
erin 'Cause America was discovered.
michael Right.
erin And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it's like. I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
michael An age or month?
erin Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
michael I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. erin is just weird.
erin How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
michael So how are things going with Andy?
erin He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
michael Well, let's see. Um. Andy. Plays the banjo.
erin Yeah I love that.
michael Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
erin What?
michael I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.
erin Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
michael Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh. Hayworth's
waiter Here we go. Hot plate.
michael Okay. Hayworth's
waiter And your salad, miss.
erin Why wouldn't he tell me that?
michael I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having s*x with somebody else.
erin They had s*x?
michael They were engaged, so. Okay, you know what, sir? Hayworth's
waiter Yes?
michael Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles? Hayworth's
waiter Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles.
michael Thank you.
erin Uhhhh, they were engaged?
michael Mm-hmm. Yeah.
erin Uh-oh.
michael Well.
erin 
michael What are you doing? What are you doing?
erin In the Foster home, my hair was my room.
michael Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
erin 
michael I'll have what she's having!
michael Did you have a. did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
pam Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
jim What's up?
dwight Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
jim Dwight, don't be gross.
pam No, no, he's right.
dwight Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
pam That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
dwight All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
pam You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
dwight Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
pam Mm. Meredith!
meredith I just like the way it feels.
pam What are you doing?!
meredith Just relax. Okay.
pam Relax?!
meredith This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
pam Give it back to me now.
meredith Okay, I was just warming it up.
pam It's disgusting!
meredith It's not a big deal.
pam It's not sterile!
meredith We're both girls. Who cares? . push;
andy So. how was lunch?
erin Lunch was fine.
andy Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
erin I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
andy Well, I know. Just want. I mean.
oscar Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
erin God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
kelly "My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant. " See I did the voice.
ryan That's a little derivative.
kelly But parody is always derivative.
ryan Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
pam jim does a really good one. Do yours.
jim Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall. "
gabe Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
jim "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies. "
gabe Ok.
andy Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
michael You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so.
andy I am saying the exact opposite. angela is fantastic.
michael No. No. No.
andy Specific shout-out.
michael Stop talking.
andy Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend. in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three.
erin I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! michael told me.
michael Oh God.
andy Can we talk about this in private?
erin I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
andy Yes.
erin Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with phyllis or kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
pam No, no never.
erin Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
dwight Yeah pretty much.
erin Who are you?! I don't know you!
gabe I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie monster issue.
kevin Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
erin Thanks.
kevin So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
pam "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful. "
gabe Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
pam What? What do you mean, suspend me?
jim I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
gabe Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. Ok fine. You too Dwight.
dwight Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
gabe I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
kevin "C" is for suspension.
andy Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
michael Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
andy I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
michael You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
andy Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it. I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
angela Psst. Hey. Erin.
erin You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
angela You embarrassed me earlier.
erin Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
angela You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
erin I want to throw up just thinking about it.
angela You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
toby I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different. I can just put it through again, you know.
pam Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
erin Really?
pam Yeah. And he worked here too.
erin It was Andy, wasn't it?
pam No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
erin I hope you find what you're looking for.
pam Thank you.
gabe So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
pam Hey Toby.
toby I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
pam Very interesting.
toby Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure.
pam Thanks Toby.
gabe Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
pam I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
jim And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
dwight Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. Gabriel, I apologize.
gabe Great.
dwight I kneel before you.
gabe Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
dwight Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
gabe Guys, to err is human.
erin Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
andy Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
erin How long were you guys together?
andy A year.
erin A year? You were together for a year?
andy Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else.
erin I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
andy I didn't see that movie.
gabe That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
kelly Do they still get paid?
gabe It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
oscar Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
meredith Pathetic.
gabe Can I buy everyone coffees? "Or cookies. "
dwight What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
gabe Alright.
kevin Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
gabe You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
dwight "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit. "
kevin "Ciao" Right? "Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee. "
gabe Why don't we say ciao to the impressions?
erin 
michael Erin?
erin Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
michael No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
erin I can't trust andy anymore.
michael Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel. I'm sorry I caused that thing.
erin It's Andy's fault.
michael Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
erin Oh, I like his butt.
michael You said butt.
erin You tricked me!
michael Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is
him "Hey! Hey Scott!"
andy Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day. Oscar's voice from the
computer Hey kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost.
kevin I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
phyllis I don't get it.
jim Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
pam Yeah. "I vant to count to ten".
kevin But oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
kelly But you're an accountant too.
oscar Why didn't you do oscar the Grouch?
pam That would have been funny.
kevin But the Count is purple and oscar wears purple.
michael Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count. " Nailed him. Nailed him. Good work Cookie Monster.
kevin Thank you.
