message Stone &amp; son Suit Warehouse contract expired with their paper provider! Go get it! –David Wallace
dwight Stone and son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business . jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family – brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. jim and dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
dwight I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of "Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire".
jim Sorry, Stinky, can't do it. Too busy.
dwight Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky.
jim Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
dwight Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
phyllis I have ears, Dwight.
dwight Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim?
jim Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now.
dwight How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
jim Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
dwight Mmm. That's a good. question. 300 times. 180. Um that comes to 25 minutes. Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
nellie Darryl, looking good!
darryl Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim's company.
pam Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell jim I miss him?
darryl Why don't you come along and tell him yourself?
pam Ha ha. That'd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get. What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
erin Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
pam A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything's in order.
erin What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it's in order? I haven't been trained for this.
pam Okay, see you later.
clark Hey guys.
phyllis Clark!
meredith Hey!
oscar Hey, look who's back, dwight Junior.
kevin Hey, so how was it? I mean. the s*x with Jan.
clark A gentleman doesn't discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
clark Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was. like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh. like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
meredith Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, "Talk classy, act nasty".
clark What's with the wig Meredith?
meredith What, is it on backwards?
clark Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It's an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so. bon appetite.
phyllis Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that's Italian.
oscar My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
meredith Always with the friends Oscar. Can't we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
oscar Actually, it's pronounced "espresso". Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So.
dwight There he is! We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but.
clark If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
dwight Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh. No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
clark I loved it.
dwight How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
clark If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend.
dwight Then looks like we have a deal. son
erin Hi guys!
pete Hey, look who it is!
erin Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
oscar Try this one.
erin Thank you!
erin I don't really have time to think about pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone's trust. About the pens.
pam You ready for your interview?
darryl I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy's job in the bag until my interview.
pam Well, you shouldn't be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
darryl Yeah, I guess.
pam Really, you can't be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he's basically Gumby with hair. Suit Store
father It's kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.
dwight You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy?
clark No, we sure hadn't Pop.
dwight Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?
clark He calls me Clarky ‘cause he's my Dad.
dwight Guilty! Suit Store
father You don't meet many hunters these days.
clark My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial killer. of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick!
dwight It was his birthday, just turned three. So. Suit Store
father Ahh.
oscar You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
nellie No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
kevin Taste test? I'm in!
oscar YOLO!
phyllis What?
oscar It's a thing. It means "you only live once".
kevin Yeah, we're aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
oscar Well.
kevin Alright everybody, who's in? Angela? Don't make us come over there.
angela No, I don't. no.
kevin Alright, let's go.
angela Can't I just agree without putting my hand in?
nellie Absolutely not!
kevin No way.
angela Oh, fine.
kevin Ok guys, "we all drink them all".
everyone We all drink them all!
kevin Yes!
oscar Yes!
nellie Whoo!
phyllis Hey, where's my ring?
creed I'm sure it'll turn up. Athlead
employee Yes ma'am, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. You'll see us on the right side, you can't miss us.
dennis . And I want to reach every demographic possible.
jim No, I hear what you're saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
dennis We're talking weeks here, not months, right?
jim Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
dennis Alright. Good.
jim Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. Hey! How are you?
pam Good!
jim What are you doing here?
pam I just wanted to see you!
jim That's so great!
darryl Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
jim It's pretty great, right? I mean, we're coming along. Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis's timeline
wade Okay
jim Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
dwight . But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark's getting out of my car. He's a good boy, does whatever I say. Suit Store
father I can't relate to that, my son hates my guts.
dwight Oh. really. Suit Store
father Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?
dwight Well, things between me and clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son.
clark Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but. God I missed you!
dwight What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
clark I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
dwight You're being disrespectful!
clark . And I love you, for saying that.
dwight We don't get along.
clark Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is. our relationship is. terr-
dwight Terrible!
clark Terrible.
dwight Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
pam Wow, this place is. so great. I had no idea – on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
jim Well, I mean, I don't even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so. These things go down all the time.
darryl If this company's going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
jim Are you cool to just hang out?
pam Sure, no problem.
jim Yeah? You ready?
darryl Yeah.
jim Let's do it!
erin The pen delivery went amazing, and now I've got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I'm not one of those people who's just like, "Uh, sure. I'll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back's turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand. they are just sitting here. pam didn't tell me not to unpack them. Don't want to be a busybody, but I don't want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it's insane! I'm sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I've never had an espresso before. They're good though. . push;
nellie A-bam! My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I've tried so far is Alpine Select!
kevin Yes!
angela Ugh!
kevin One!
angela Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
kevin Two.
angela Stop it!
kevin Three.
oscar That's enough Kevin.
angela Stop it Kevin!
kevin Four!
oscar That's enough!
angela Kevin!
clark So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing. Suit Store
father I heard that before.
clark Well, I understand, but –
dwight I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
clark Here we go again, another lecture from the old man. Suit Store
father Listen to him. He created you.
dwight Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you.
clark Women don't despise me.
dwight His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn't see it, or didn't wanna see it.
clark Alright, that's enough, ‘cause I can say some things about him too.
dwight Yeah? Like what?
clark Like the time that you got drunk and, and then. Killed those kids on their way to prom!
dwight That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught "saving treats" from the kitty litter box. Suit Store
father Really shameful.
clark So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
dwight Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
clark There's obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
dwight Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going "please kitty, may I have some more?" You can't make this stuff up!
clark No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends. Suit Store
son Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waiting. Suit Store
father Here he is, my son.
dwight Got cat turd collector written all over him. Suit Store
son . Did you say cat turd collector? Athlead
employee . So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now we're just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the northeast. Of course, that's not a mandate.
darryl "Mandate"- Always think of two men on a date. I have gay friends. I have one gay friend. Oscar?
jim Mm-hm Athlead
employee Alright, so what makes you think you'd be a good fit here?
darryl Ummm. Alright. Obviously y'all look really busy, and uh, I don't want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh. Obviously I'm not qualified to be here man, I'm. I'm a warehouse manager, you know. Athlead
employee Darryl, I was a newspaper editor. Female Athlead
employee Science teacher, volleyball coach. 3rd Athlead
employee I work at a home shopping network. 4th Athlead
employee I'm a laywer. I'm the only one here who can honestly help.
jim And as you know, I was a paper salesman. Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked.
darryl Cool. Hey, thanks. Athlead
employee So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company?
darryl Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh. I wrote some down. There you go. Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me!
stanley Ah! So, this is what 2
 00 P. M. looks like around here!
stanley I usually take a siesta about now.
pete Stocking pens, huh? You're like the new office administrator.
erin No, I just took over the pen shipment because pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it's the truth, I swear.
kevin Pam! Pam, look out! Erin's gunning for your job!
erin No, I'm not! It's not like that at all! Forget it, I'm so sorry.
kevin Pam, look out!
erin Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you've had. Athlead
employee By the way, jim talks about you all the time.
pam That's sweet that he talks about me. Athlead
employee It's too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton though.
pam Well, that's funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia. Athlead
employee We can't wait until you move here. Suit Store
son I'm sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?
dwight Do you mind? The men are talking. Suit Store
father Sons used to idolize their fathers.
dwight Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract? Suit Store
father I'd love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I'm just here for human contract. Suit Store
son Okay Pop.
dwight Wait, so you're the boss? Suit Store
son That's right.
clark Hi, I'm Clark. Suit Store
son Hey.
clark Let's talk. Suit Store
son Okay.
clark So if you look at our catalog here. Athlead
employee Well, thanks for coming down Darryl. Female Athlead
employee It was nice meeting you Darryl, I think you'd fit in great here.
darryl Yeah, yeah me too. I think it'd be like. You know what? I think it'd be like a kevin Durant jump shot. Perfecto! Oh my god.
pam They're the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece.
darryl So I'm like a three year old girl in this scenario.
pam Say they don't hire you. It's not like you're out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
darryl And I'd only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I'm. I'm not so sure I'd like living in Philadelphia.
pam Right? Thank you! It's just Philly. Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London.
darryl Who needs it?
pam Not us.
jim Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They're going to make you pay for the fish, and. they wanted to know when you can start.
darryl What? How about yesterday?
pam Congratulations.
darryl Oh, thank you.
pam I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
darryl Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
pam No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl. Maybe I'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him.
kevin It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
oscar It's insane! They need to have the A. C. on year round! January too!
angela I don't get the point of this stupid window!
clark I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad's suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That's why his face always breaks out. Suit Store
son Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher?
clark You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I'm going to need one right? If I'm ever going to get a "real job" and move my "lazy ass" out of your "G. D. house". Suit Store
son He's got you there. Suit Store
son That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful. Although expensive.
dwight Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island.
clark Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
dwight That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
clark How do I look?
dwight Actually. You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too.
oscar Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don't we move the copier into the annex like we've always wanted to?
nellie Whoo!
meredith Frickin' A!
oscar Huh?
kevin So long, noise!
oscar One, two, three!
nellie And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble!
oscar Wait! It's beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
meredith Tear up the carpet!
nellie Whoo!
darryl Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That's how you do that, baby. It's all good, I'm ready. Y'all ready for this?
pam Everybody dance now.
oscar Kevin, move. I can't pull up the rug if you're standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
kevin Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
angela Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
nellie Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don't you just have some more coffee?
stanley It's all gone. I didn't get a chance to try them all because creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
creed I saw the leaves twitch!
angela Shut up!
creed You shut up!
oscar Everybody shut up and work!
phyllis We don't work for you!
kevin Yeah!
angela Yeah!
stanley Hey, it's five o'clock.
oscar Kevin, can-
angela What's going on?
dwight Yes! We did it!
clark You opened the door-
dwight And you closed it. The boys are back in town. High fives! Ha ha!
clark Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
dwight You got me! I used to collect them!
clark Why?
dwight Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
pam Hey. What happened here?
erin You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That's what happened. The pens happened.
pam . Are the pens here?
