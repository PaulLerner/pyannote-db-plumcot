kelly_kapoor Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
phyllis_vance Shh. He wears that so he can sleep at his desk. Who are you?
kelly_kapoor Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from s*x And The City.
phyllis_vance Mm. I like your shoes.
kelly_kapoor Thank you. Will you help walk me to the fax machine?
phyllis_vance Sure.
ryan_howard I got her, I got her. I can help you. You look amazing.
kelly_kapoor Inappropriate. Thank you. Who are you, Larry King?
ryan_howard Gordon Gekko.
kelly_kapoor Oh, from the insurance commercials!
ryan_howard ... Yeah.
oscar_martinez Whoa. Awesome.
creed_bratton Let's put a smile on that face!
kevin_malone Dammit Creed! I've been up since four!
andy_bernard Meow. Sweet 'stume, dude. Who are you supposed to be?
jim_halpert Dave.
andy_bernard Cool.
jim_halpert You are? A cat?
andy_bernard We were looking for "kitten."
jim_halpert Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
pam_beesly Thanks. My costume's getting a lot of attention.
pam_beesly So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.
dwight_schrute Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! Disappear.
michael_scott Okay, I think we are set. We have puzzles, string for Cat's Cradles. Burned this last night. A little road trip CD. Puppets.
holly_flax Oh, look at all this stuff! It's only seven hours.
michael_scott When Corporate found out that we were dating, they decided they were going to transfer Holly back to her old branch, in Nashua, New Hampshire.
holly_flax Michael is taking a personal day to move me up.
michael_scott Road trip! Right?
holly_flax Breaker one-nine, copy?
michael_scott Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
darryl_philbin Hey! Do Not Touch My Radio.
michael_scott We're not.
holly_flax Kidding.
michael_scott We're not doing anything.
holly_flax It's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in Scranton, and I said "Well, why don't you quit and get some job in Nashua?" And he said "I asked you first." And I said "First!" at the same time he did. And then I said "Jinx." And then we never talked about it again and haven't been back to the conversation. So...
michael_scott All right everybody. I'm out of here. Jim, you're in charge.
jim_halpert Oh, I'll walk you out.
michael_scott Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
michael_scott You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.
jim_halpert All right. We'll see. No.
jim_halpert I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.
dwight_schrute Good morning temp.
ryan_howard 'Morning. Wow. Good morning Dwight.
dwight_schrute Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis?
andy_bernard Ha ha ha. That's funny. Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.
dwight_schrute Andy.
andy_bernard Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
dwight_schrute No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
andy_bernard Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
dwight_schrute Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
phyllis_vance I'm sitting right here Dwight.
dwight_schrute I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
dwight_schrute Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it.
holly_flax I have to unpack this weekend but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!
michael_scott Cool!
darryl_philbin Mike you'll drive this every weekend?
michael_scott We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
michael_scott and Holly Life is a highway, I want to ride it all night long.
michael_scott Holly, and Darryl If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way...
dwight_schrute Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
andy_bernard Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
dwight_schrute Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
andy_bernard I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
dwight_schrute Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
pam_beesly Hey!
tom_halpert Hey, future baby sis!
pam_beesly How are you Tom. Nice to see you.
tom_halpert I'm good.
pam_beesly I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, "That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best."
pam_beesly Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.
pete_halpert That's perfect. You know what would be even more hilarious? Remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?
tom_halpert Right! That would be hilarious! We should totally dog her, about being an artist, never making any money!
pete_halpert That, is awesome!
tom_halpert Like she basically has a hobby, for a job.
pete_halpert Oh yeah.
pam_beesly So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?
pete_halpert I think this is better.
tom_halpert The other thing would "get" Jim.
pete_halpert This is nicer, it's fun. It's fun!
pam_beesly Okay, okay.
tom_halpert Oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends.
pam_beesly Oookay....
pam_beesly They came up with that idea really fast.
darryl_philbin This trip was longer than I thought.
holly_flax Yeah it did look shorter on the map-
michael_scott Ah! Ah! Ahhhh! Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
holly_flax You were sleeping? You were talking before.
michael_scott Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
darryl_philbin Not really.
michael_scott All right. What's the scoop, how far?
darryl_philbin Four hours. Almost halfway there.
holly_flax We're only halfway?
michael_scott Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
darryl_philbin Next exit isn't for five miles.
holly_flax Let's check there.
pam_beesly Hey guys.
jim_halpert Hey, how are you?
pam_beesly Hi!
jim_halpert Good to see you.
pete_halpert Nice to see you again, Pam.
tom_halpert Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long!
jim_halpert All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.
darryl_philbin There's nothing out here man.
michael_scott Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
michael_scott Here we go, fourth time's a charm. "Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... Hey. Are you crying?
holly_flax No.
michael_scott Allergies?
holly_flax No.
michael_scott Did Darryl touch you?
darryl_philbin WHAT!?
holly_flax No, Darryl did not touch me. Can we just keep going, please?
michael_scott What's the matter?
holly_flax It's not gonna work.
michael_scott Sure it is.
holly_flax There's too much distance.
michael_scott Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
holly_flax Michael we've only been dating each other for a few weeks
michael_scott Listen to me. I like you so much.
holly_flax And I like you too.
michael_scott And I've dated four women in the last--
holly_flax I've dated four guys last year too.
michael_scott Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
holly_flax Oh.
michael_scott I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
holly_flax Michael. Don't. Don't. Don't make it harder than it has to be.
michael_scott That's what she said.
michael_scott Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.
andy_bernard Take that down.
dwight_schrute Excuse me?
andy_bernard Take. That down.
meredith_palmer You know I once dated a couple of guys from Cornell. They were really nice. They gave me a ride home.
andy_bernard I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.
creed_bratton It's pronounced Ker-nell. It's the highest rank in the military.
andy_bernard It's pronounced "Corn-ell!" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
dwight_schrute Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
andy_bernard Fine.
dwight_schrute What do you say?
andy_bernard Yeah, good. Can we--- Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!
holly_flax If you leave on Friday, by five, you'll be rolling in at... midnight? At best?
michael_scott Yeah.
holly_flax And then sleep in Saturday. That only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again.
michael_scott Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.
holly_flax Oh.
michael_scott I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
holly_flax Well-
michael_scott Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
holly_flax How long could we keep that up?
michael_scott Years!
holly_flax Years?
michael_scott Yeah.
holly_flax Years? Of just a few hours every weekend?
michael_scott Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
holly_flax Thank you.
michael_scott My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
darryl_philbin Clever, Mike.
tom_halpert So Pam, how much does an artist make after they leave art school?
pete_halpert Yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?
jim_halpert That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
tom_halpert Maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin.
jim_halpert Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
pete_halpert Hey, just having fun Jimmy.
tom_halpert Yeah. Right Pam?
pam_beesly Yup!
michael_scott You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well. We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?
holly_flax I do, I think so.
michael_scott Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
darryl_philbin Hey what's up, I just thought I'd try you. I was thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit.
michael_scott I don't know what I'm gonna do!
darryl_philbin Please call me back.
michael_scott Please?
holly_flax You'll be okay
michael_scott I'm not gonna be okay.
darryl_philbin Please...
holly_flax You will.
michael_scott No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
andy_bernard You might be interested-
stanley_hudson What?
andy_bernard Dwight!
dwight_schrute Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
andy_bernard Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
dwight_schrute That's a conflict of interest.
andy_bernard Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
dwight_schrute Interview.
andy_bernard Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
dwight_schrute What?
andy_bernard The conference room!
dwight_schrute Okay.
andy_bernard Who are your role models?
andy_bernard If I had to put Dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none percent chance.
andy_bernard So, Dane Cook, Jack Bauer, and Eli Whitney. You're doing great.
jim_halpert Oh wow. This is my niece Vanessa. She's a trumpeter. And, look at her.
pam_beesly Cute.
jim_halpert That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
tom_halpert Yup. She only knows how to play "When the Saints go Marching In."
jim_halpert Love that one.
pete_halpert Yeah but, she doesn't think she's gonna be like, career musician right?
jim_halpert Here you go again! What is your deal today?
pete_halpert Just saying. How many famous trumpeters can you name besides... Louis Armstrong?
pam_beesly Miles Davis.
jim_halpert One.
pam_beesly Chet ...something.
jim_halpert Half.
pete_halpert The point is Pam, is there are jobs-
pam_beesly Dizzy Gillespie.
jim_halpert Also good.
pete_halpert And there are hobbies. I love baseball more than anything, but you don't see me try to get on the Mets.
tom_halpert You don't!
jim_halpert Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
pete_halpert I'm just calling it like I see it.
pam_beesly I don't know if I'm gonna make any money with art.
jim_halpert Pam, don't worry about it.
pam_beesly I mean it's a very competitive field. But I have a professor who says I have a lot of promise, and if I don't try now, I never will. So...
jim_halpert Guys, what is going on?!
tom_halpert We pranked you!
pete_halpert It was Pam's idea. Pam was the mastermind.
pam_beesly ... Got you.
pete_halpert That was killer. I was so close to blowing it.
andy_bernard Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
dwight_schrute Bring it.
andy_bernard Who was Cornell's eighth president?
dwight_schrute Dale Raymond Corson!
andy_bernard Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. Comprehension skills, sub-par.
dwight_schrute Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.
andy_bernard What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
dwight_schrute On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
andy_bernard Nobody wants ...that, to happen.
dwight_schrute Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
andy_bernard "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."
dwight_schrute "Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."
andy_bernard "Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations."
dwight_schrute "Interviewer has suspect motives."
andy_bernard "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid."
dwight_schrute "Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth." Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
andy_bernard I have everything I need-
dwight_schrute And you will be hearing from the -
andy_bernard And you will be hearing from -
dwight_schrute -Cornell Application Department,
andy_bernard which I will not be a part of-
dwight_schrute And you will not be pleased with the result.
andy_bernard And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
dwight_schrute And your affiliation with Cornell -
andy_bernard And your affiliation with Cornell -
dwight_schrute Will end completely!
andy_bernard Will end completely!
dwight_schrute That is all sir, you may go.
darryl_philbin There's another dolly in the truck, Mike. You could take more than that lamp.
pam_beesly For the record, I wanted go another direction. Which was way better.
jim_halpert Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
pam_beesly Okay. I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. Left it in my smock. I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. Look I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger, you can hardly see it, it's very subtle.
jim_halpert That is good.
pam_beesly Thank you.
jim_halpert Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank. Oh, text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family."
pam_beesly Oh. Hey how about at Thanksgiving we prank Tom about being bald?
darryl_philbin This is the last of it.
michael_scott Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
darryl_philbin You're not staying?
michael_scott You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.
darryl_philbin But you want me to put it back in the truck.
michael_scott I'll be down in just a second. Holly?
michael_scott So um... I think I'm gonna go back with Darryl Okay. Goodbye.
holly_flax Okay. Bye.
darryl_philbin I know it's hard Mike. Break-ups hurt.
michael_scott We didn't break up.
darryl_philbin Looked like it. Sometimes when I'm down like this, it helps to sing the blues.
michael_scott Okay.
darryl_philbin Da na na na na... da na na na na...
michael_scott That's a really pretty song.
darryl_philbin Da na na na na. No, no, check it out, look. Da na na na na... want to do that?
michael_scott Okay.
darryl_philbin That's when you hit me with what's getting you down, okay?
michael_scott Okay.
darryl_philbin Da na na na na.
michael_scott Da na na na na.
darryl_philbin Da na na na na.
michael_scott Da na na na na.
darryl_philbin No, wait. You're, you're supposed to... Never mind. Da na na na na.
michael_scott Da na na na na.
darryl_philbin Da na na na na.
michael_scott Da na na na na.
darryl_philbin Da na na na na!!
michael_scott Da na na na na!!
darryl_philbin Da na na na na .
michael_scott Da na na na na.
darryl_philbin Yeah! Da na na na na.
michael_scott Da na na na na.
darryl_philbin YEAH! Da na na na na.
michael_scott Da na na na na...
andy_bernard I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
dwight_schrute Where did you get those?
andy_bernard What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
dwight_schrute I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
andy_bernard Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
dwight_schrute Cornell.
