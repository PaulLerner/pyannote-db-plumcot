kevin_malone So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
pam_beesly No.
kevin_malone 'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
jim_halpert Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
phyllis_vance Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
pam_beesly Yeah?
phyllis_vance Yeah, pretty stationery.
pam_beesly Oh, thanks!
angela_martin I didn't get mine yet.
pam_beesly Uh...
pam_beesly There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
michael_scott Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
phyllis_vance Uh, on or off?
I.D.#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode21 Photographer Off.
phyllis_vance Okay...
dwight_schrute Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
phyllis_vance Excuse me.
dwight_schrute Clown paint.
dwight_schrute I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
michael_scott That's a nice tie.
ryan_howard Thank you.
michael_scott That is... who makes that?
ryan_howard Um, I don't...
michael_scott Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
ryan_howard Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes.
oscar_martinez It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
michael_scott What's the dealio?
toby_flenderson Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
michael_scott What's the problem?
oscar_martinez Angela!
toby_flenderson It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
oscar_martinez Since Christmas.
michael_scott So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
oscar_martinez No.
toby_flenderson Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
michael_scott Yes.
toby_flenderson Here's how I usually handle this all I do is listen.
michael_scott Yeah?
toby_flenderson These things just have a way of working themselves out.
michael_scott Okay.
toby_flenderson It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
michael_scott What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
toby_flenderson Okay.
michael_scott Okay... what?
toby_flenderson That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
michael_scott Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
michael_scott A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
angela_martin Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
michael_scott No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
oscar_martinez What's the next one?
michael_scott Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
angela_martin Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
michael_scott Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
michael_scott Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using "I" emotion language and no judging or "you" statements.
angela_martin I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
michael_scott Come on, seriously, that?
oscar_martinez I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
michael_scott Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
pam_beesly Win!
michael_scott Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
oscar_martinez No.
angela_martin That's... no...
michael_scott Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
angela_martin How about, I leave it up?
oscar_martinez How 'bout, she takes it down?
pam_beesly How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
michael_scott Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
pam_beesly Win.
oscar_martinez Fine.
angela_martin But, it...
michael_scott It is done!
pam_beesly Win
the_photographer No, you're all good.
creed_bratton Great.
pam_beesly Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code.
angela_martin Oh. Thanks.
angela_martin It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
toby_flenderson You solved it?
michael_scott Yes.
toby_flenderson Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out.
michael_scott Are those all the other complains?
toby_flenderson Mmm-Hm.
michael_scott I would like to see those please.
toby_flenderson I... I can't do that.
michael_scott You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
toby_flenderson That...
michael_scott Okay. There! No more conflict. I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. All right... is that it?
toby_flenderson It's all Dwight's.
toby_flenderson Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
michael_scott Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
the_photographer Are you sure?
dwight_schrute Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
the_photographer
michael_scott This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
pam_beesly Nice.
michael_scott You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
toby_flenderson Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year.
michael_scott How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
angela_martin You already did me.
michael_scott That's what she said. The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
toby_flenderson Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
michael_scott Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
dwight_schrute Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
pam_beesly Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
michael_scott All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
pam_beesly Wait, what did it say?
michael_scott Uh... "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?" Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
pam_beesly I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
michael_scott Here is a Kelly complaint "Ryan never returns my calls." Ugh, join the club.
ryan_howard My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
kelly_kapoor I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
toby_flenderson To your HR representative.
kelly_kapoor To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
toby_flenderson Fine, I'll take your name off. So no one will know.
michael_scott Makin' progress. Yes?
jim_halpert Dwight tried to kiss me.
michael_scott What?!
jim_halpert And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
dwight_schrute That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
jim_halpert Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
dwight_schrute Okay, question. When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
toby_flenderson Sure.
michael_scott Stanley.
pam_beesly Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
michael_scott You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
angela_martin I didn't do it!
pam_beesly I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
michael_scott Someone complained that the men's room is "whites only". Stanley, you know that's not true.
stanley_hudson I didn't say that.
creed_bratton Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door?
michael_scott Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
phyllis_vance No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
michael_scott And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
phyllis_vance Stanley and I are close, too.
stanley_hudson We sit close.
michael_scott Oh... ok.
toby_flenderson Just take it.
pam_beesly I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
jim_halpert Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
pam_beesly Don't take her side.
jim_halpert Well, what does Roy think about everything?
pam_beesly I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
jim_halpert You mean your thoughts and feelings?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Yeah...
phyllis_vance I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
angela_martin Yes, that's the problem.
phyllis_vance I guess so...
michael_scott Okay, well... all settled, then.
phyllis_vance I don't like you.
michael_scott OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
creed_bratton I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
michael_scott All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
kevin_malone I accept your decision!
jim_halpert Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
dwight_schrute That doesn't make any sense.
jim_halpert Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
the_photographer Smile.
dwight_schrute No.
dwight_schrute I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
jim_halpert This came out really well. There you go.
dwight_schrute This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
jim_halpert Oh.
dwight_schrute And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
jim_halpert What did I write?
dwight_schrute I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
toby_flenderson Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
dwight_schrute What box?!
phyllis_vance But I didn't report your snoring-
stanley_hudson Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays...
michael_scott Uh. Dwight.
dwight_schrute Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
michael_scott Okay! Calm down.
dwight_schrute No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
michael_scott Hey, hey!
dwight_schrute Him or me?
michael_scott Stop.
dwight_schrute Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
michael_scott Okay...
dwight_schrute Either he goes, or I go.
michael_scott Dwight...
dwight_schrute You choose!
michael_scott Stop...
dwight_schrute One of us is out of here by the end of today!
michael_scott Oh... kay...
dwight_schrute I am not bluffing!
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute Okay?
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
michael_scott Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute I deserve this. You know I do!
michael_scott You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
dwight_schrute You have till five.
dwight_schrute Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
michael_scott Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
michael_scott Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
michael_scott Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert." "Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to."
jim_halpert Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
michael_scott "This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer." "Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." Gah. "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone."
jim_halpert That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
michael_scott "Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'."
jim_halpert Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
michael_scott "By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier."
jim_halpert Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
michael_scott The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
jim_halpert Maybe Stanford would be cool.
dwight_schrute It's a good market. Higher volume.
jim_halpert Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
dwight_schrute I have a girlfriend...
jim_halpert Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
michael_scott Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
dwight_schrute So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
michael_scott Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
dwight_schrute I want an answer by tomorrow.
michael_scott Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
dwight_schrute Fine.
michael_scott Good. Okay.
michael_scott Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
the_photographer I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
michael_scott Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
the_photographer You mean digital?
michael_scott It'll take like two seconds.
the_photographer 20 bucks.
michael_scott Ugh... All right. Everybody, come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
stanley_hudson You gotta be kiddin' me.
michael_scott Come on, everybody.
dwight_schrute Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
the_photographer One, two, three... smile. Try to smile.
michael_scott We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
the_photographer Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three... whether you smile or not. One, two, three.
michael_scott Good, let's check that out. Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
the_photographer That'll be another 20.
michael_scott What?
pam_beesly Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
michael_scott You just press the button.
angela_martin What?
jim_halpert No, Pam.
pam_beesly I am. It's about the Save The Date.
jim_halpert Pam, it wasn't her.
pam_beesly What?!
jim_halpert I'm the one who complained about you.
jim_halpert I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. I was just venting.
michael_scott Okay, good. Check that out.
jim_halpert You know, it was one day.
michael_scott That's terrible.
jim_halpert And I took it right back. It was like...
pam_beesly Okay.
phyllis_vance Oh, dear.
michael_scott Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.
michael_scott It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
michael_scott One, two.. Didn't say three, did I?
michael_scott But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
jim_halpert Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye.
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode21 worker Okay, Jan will see you now.
jim_halpert Oh, thanks.
michael_scott And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
