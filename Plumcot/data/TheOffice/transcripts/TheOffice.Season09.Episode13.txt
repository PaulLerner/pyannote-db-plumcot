pam_beesly Hey Brian, you got a sec?
brian Yeah, hold on a sec.
pam_beesly I feel awful.
brian It's fine. It was my first slip up in nine years of miking you.
erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin.
pam_beesly Well, thanks for being a good friend.
brian Sure, anytime. Uh, how about you and Jim? Everything squared away?
pam_beesly Yeah, mostly.
erin_hannon Pam, phone call.
pam_beesly Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.
brian Will do.
pam_beesly Okay. Thank you.
brian Sure.
meredith_palmer Hey, boom guy.
brian Oh, hey Meredith.
meredith_palmer When are you gonna boom me?
brian Uh, listen, they're cracking down on us talking to the subjects. It's a lame rule, but, you know, I wanna... I, I'll see you later.
meredith_palmer Got it.
clark Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
dwight_schrute That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
clark Well, uh... see, you raised it.
dwight_schrute Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
dwight_schrute Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, "Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses." Wow.
clark You know what, man? I deserve this job.
dwight_schrute Mm-hmm.
clark I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond... and under.
dwight_schrute You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
dwight_schrute Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor – he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants.
clark This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
dwight_schrute Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
jim_halpert You could've just called that an alliance too, right?
dwight_schrute I chose my words very carefully.
jim_halpert Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse.
clark You interviewing for the sales job too?
rolf No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it.
clark Well, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, I've been working here 12 weeks. That's a full season of Homeland. A ton of things can happen in that amount of time, as we've seen.
rolf I'm Rolf. Rolf Ahl.
clark Rolf Ahl? Sounds kinda like Roald Dahl.
rolf Go to hell.
clark There he is.
dwight_schrute Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor.
rolf Nice.
dwight_schrute Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
pam_beesly When are you talking to David Wallace?
jim_halpert I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up.
pam_beesly Too late. My hopes are up.
jim_halpert Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix – me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys.
dwight_schrute And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
jim_halpert I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.
dwight_schrute No doy!
jim_halpert I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.
rolf I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds.
dwight_schrute No earbuds!
jim_halpert I'm sure he's just nervous.
pam_beesly It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.
dwight_schrute So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.
rolf Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me?
dwight_schrute Well, I'm the one offering the job.
rolf What are your credentials?
dwight_schrute I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
rolf I think I've heard everything I need to hear.
dwight_schrute Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.
rolf Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch.
dwight_schrute Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump," and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
dwight_schrute What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?
trevor Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.
dwight_schrute Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
trevor Pass. Next one.
dwight_schrute All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
trevor No, no and no.
dwight_schrute There were only two options.
trevor Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?
dwight_schrute This is a bus transfer.
trevor Nothing gets by this guy.
clark Hey Jim, do you mind if I look over these price sheets before my interview?
jim_halpert Sure, yeah, go ahead.
clark Thanks, dude. You—you sure it's okay? ‘Cause you're kinda—
jim_halpert Yeah, absolutely. Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?
clark Oh, Dove Men.
jim_halpert Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so—
clark Yeah, could I just have a minute to prepare for this?
jim_halpert Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.
clark Thanks, dude.
jim_halpert Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.
clark Why?
jim_halpert I need you to breathe in my face right now.
clark
jim_halpert What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?
clark Wintergreen.
jim_halpert I knew it, I knew it.
clark Yeah, good nose.
jim_halpert I looked at you coming around, and I said, "Wintergreen."
dwight_schrute I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
dwight_schrute Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
clark That's just a classic no-win situation.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
clark So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.
dwight_schrute Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
clark Yep.
dwight_schrute Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ...
clark You know what, Dwight?
dwight_schrute And anoth—
clark This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process.
dwight_schrute No.
clark Yeah. Star Trek rules.
dwight_schrute It does, but still no.
clark Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
dwight_schrute Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.
stanley_hudson This is not natural.
oscar_martinez Just – I don't wanna make assumptions based on people's physical appearances.
pam_beesly Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?
darryl_philbin They smell so bad.
meredith_palmer If I ever get that bad, you'd tell me, right?
kevin_malone Meredith, I tell you all the time.
meredith_palmer Walked right into that one.
dwight_schrute Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.
dwight_schrute What quality would make you a good sales associate?
mose People person.
dwight_schrute It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
mose That's right.
dwight_schrute You know we live together, right?
mose Yes.
dwight_schrute And I've never seen you go to work, ever.
mose Okay.
dwight_schrute So why is this on your resume?
clark So how'd you guys hear about the position?
gabor My—my mom.
nate Dwight called my house, but he didn't realize that I had already moved out, because my mom and I are quarrelling because I- I can't stay out of her stuff.
zeke Dwight's my cousin, so I overheard him telling my brother Mose about the job opportunity in the shower.
clark You were in the shower or he was in the shower?
zeke Everyone was in the shower. It's a cow shower, so there's like, a ton of people in there.
clark So you guys all know Dwight already?
dwights_babysitter I was his babysitter, and then we dated for a while. He was a passionate lover and the sweetest little baby.
gabor I knew you looked familiar. You used to pick up Dwight from school.
dwights_babysitter You went to X-Men school too?
clark X-Men school?
dwight_schrute When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
gabor Oh, I have a few powers. Night hearing. Dogs understand where I point. And our training included picking carrots, scrubbing tubs, sewing imitation Levi's. A lot of telemarketing.
angela_martin I don't want to sit near any of those people for the next 20 years. Someone say something.
stanley_hudson I said something when they were thinking of hiring Jim. Didn't work then. And now look what he's doing to us.
nellie_bertram Yeah, Jim, this is all your fault.
jim_halpert How is it my fault?
nellie_bertram Here's an exercise for you, Jim. Imagine there are consequences to your actions. Imagine the whole world does not revolve around this. There are others.
jim_halpert But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.
oscar_martinez Yeah, but Jim, Dwight's a weirdo. We can't blame a weirdo for bringing in weirdos. We can blame a normal for creating a situation where a weirdo was allowed to bring in weirdos.
pam_beesly Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. Forget it. I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.
david_wallace Wallace Hey Jim, I thought our call was for later.
jim_halpert Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input—
dwight_schrute This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.
david_wallace Wallace Hey, Dwight. It's David.
dwight_schrute David.
david_wallace Wallace Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process.
dwight_schrute Really? That's interesting. ‘Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
jim_halpert I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife—
david_wallace Wallace Jim, another thing. Since we are gonna have to hire this junior sales associate to cover for you, I am going to have to pay you only for the days that you actually work.
jim_halpert Oh. Um...
david_wallace Wallace Yeah.
jim_halpert Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.
dwight_schrute Sounds fair to me, David.
david_wallace Wallace And I know we have a call scheduled for later –
jim_halpert Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.
dwight_schrute No. Why not do it now?
david_wallace Wallace Yeah. What's up Jim?
jim_halpert Uh... Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
dwight_schrute I'd love to be in the loop, David.
david_wallace Wallace It's okay. Go ahead, Jim.
jim_halpert There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor –
david_wallace Wallace Okay. Jim, I'm gonna have to stop you right there.
jim_halpert Yes, okay. Bye.
dwight_schrute I'd love to invest.
jim_halpert No, thanks.
dwight_schrute I'd like to give you $100 million.
hidetoshi_hasagawa Why you make trees into bushes? You don't make paper from bushes.
pam_beesly Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?
hidetoshi_hasagawa Thank you.
pam_beesly Yeah.
troy_undercook Whoops.
zeke It's dense. Like bread.
jim_halpert Dwight, you can't just hire someone ‘cause they're your friend.
dwight_schrute I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
nellie_bertram They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
dwight_schrute You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
darryl_philbin Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into m*st*rb*t*ng.
wolf Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.
dwight_schrute Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
dwight_schrute Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of ‘em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
dwight_schrute Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
wolf Do you want this paper?
dwight_schrute I sure do.
wolf It's not very good.
dwight_schrute I will pay you whatever it takes.
wolf I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.
dwight_schrute No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
wolf Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over.
dwight_schrute Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?
wolf I am.
dwight_schrute Okay. Good, good, good.
hidetoshi_hasagawa I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.
dwight_schrute This isn't gonna work out.
hidetoshi_hasagawa Thank you.
dwight_schrute Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them?
dwight_schrute No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.
dwights_babysitter Do you need to be changed?
dwight_schrute I do that myself now.
dwights_babysitter Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car.
dwight_schrute No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
dwights_babysitter Well, the joke's on them. I live right next to the tow yard. All they did was save me some gas.
trevor Hey man, we get how difficult this is. And no matter how you choose, we're still gonna be your friend.
wolf Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvina—
dwight_schrute Or none of you
wolf Yeah, you'd bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us.
trevor Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.
dwight_schrute I wish I could hire all of you.
zeke I could start Monday.
dwight_schrute Psst. Jim Jim? Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
jim_halpert Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say.
dwight_schrute Just act natural.
dwight_schrute And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
jim_halpert But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.
dwight_schrute Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.
jim_halpert Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
dwight_schrute I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
jim_halpert I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
dwight_schrute Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
jim_halpert Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
dwight_schrute Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
jim_halpert And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
sensei_ira Ira I'm sorry?
dwight_schrute What? This is such bullcrap!
jim_halpert Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
dwight_schrute Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
jim_halpert Too much now.
dwight_schrute Okay.
nate Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
dwight_schrute Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
jim_halpert That seems inconsiderate.
rolf No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.
dwight_schrute Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
trevor Well, my day's shot.
rolf Yeah, it's that weird hour where it's too late to start a slow roast and too early for a Swanson's.
wolf I got it. Paintball.
dwight_schrute Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
trevor And what are we supposed to do until then?
dwight_schrute Okay.
wolf Let's just go, you guys.
rolf Yeah. No limit on weapons class, right?
jim_halpert All right. I think that went well.
jim_halpert So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out—Hey. Meet your new desk mate.
clark What's up good lookin'?
pam_beesly Oh, cool. Hey Clark.
jim_halpert Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.
pam_beesly Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.
jim_halpert Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.
pam_beesly Of course.
jim_halpert I'll call you when I get there.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert All right.
pam_beesly Bye.
jim_halpert Take care of my wife. I will be back.
dwight_schrute They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
clark Hey, Pam, I'm going to the kitchen. You want anything?
pam_beesly I'm good.
dwight_schrute Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee.
clark Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
dwight_schrute
pam_beesly Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
dwight_schrute Who, me?
pam_beesly Us.
dwight_schrute Absolutely, I do.
pam_beesly Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that.
dwight_schrute Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great.
pam_beesly
pam_beesly & Dwight
dwight_schrute Aah!
clark No!
dwight_schrute Welcome to the club, pig!
pam_beesly No, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Aah!
jim_halpert No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.
