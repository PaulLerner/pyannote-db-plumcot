michael Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
pam I'm not making any copies.
michael Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
pam Nothing new.
michael Lay them on me. What?
pam There's nothing new.
michael That's not what you said earlier.
pam Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the.
michael The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um. Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.
jan So, which health plan have you decided on?
michael I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
jan Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
michael I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
jan The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.
michael Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
jan Michael.
michael You gotta crack these things open.
jan You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
michael Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um. It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
jan It's your job. So.
michael Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
jan Michael. maybe. I mean.
michael There, there.
jan Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
michael When have you ever done that?
jan I'm doing it right now. To you.
jim Last night on Trading Spouses, there's. have you seen it?
pam No. I have a life.
jim Interesting, what's that like?
pam You should try it sometime.
jim Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is.
pam . your problem.
michael Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
michael There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
jim Gosh.
michael Yeah!
jim That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
michael Really?
jim Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I. am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
jim Any time michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that dwight should do it.
dwight Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
jim Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
dwight OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
michael Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
dwight OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
michael You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
dwight Yes, I have an office. Bigger than his.
michael Nope, you cannot use it.
dwight OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
michael Temporary workspace. You can use it.
dwight Thank you.
michael If dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.
dwight What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
dwight In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead. " Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
stanley There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1, 200 deductible.
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael Pam, michael Scott. How's tricks?
pam Where are you?
michael Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
pam Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the.
michael Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
pam No you're not.
michael I have to make a call after I finish. my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
pam OK.
michael Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
pam Still no one calling.
pam Dwight, what.
dwight Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
jim It says "workspace".
dwight Same thing.
jim If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
dwight Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
jim You are not my superior.
dwight Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
jim I thought it was a workspace?
pam OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
dwight Yes. And my decision in final.
pam This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
dwight Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
jim You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
dwight Sure.
jim Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
dwight Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
jim OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
dwight I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
pam Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
dwight So I can lower it.
oscar He literally won't come out of his office.
kevin He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.
angela Kevin! That's inappropriate.
oscar Michael, can I talk to you?
michael Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
meredith Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
michael Ah, what? Which memo?
pam Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.
michael Is it a good plan?
dwight It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
oscar It's like a pay decrease.
pam Michael, he made huge cuts.
michael Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
dwight Yeah, you said.
michael No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
dwight I can handle that.
michael OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
oscar This is not good.
angela It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?
oscar What was that?
angela You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.
kevin What are you guys talking about?
angela Nothing, Kevin.
michael Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I. what a great guy. I love him. I. love him.
dwight OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
jim OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
dwight OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
jim Workspace. . push;
michael You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
pam Where are you going?
michael Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. Couldn't find the knob.
michael So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend. Travel
agent I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?
michael Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so.
jim Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.
pam I'm inventing new diseases.
jim Oh, great.
pam So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?
jim I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
pam Nice.
jim Thank you.
michael Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride. Man on
phone You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.
michael Its says here that it's a 300ft drop. Man on
phone It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
michael So it's not a free fall? Man on
phone It's an industrial coal elevator.
michael Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what. you got laser tag or something?
michael OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
dwight Damnit! Damnit Jim!
dwight All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
jim What are you talking about?
dwight Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
jim OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
dwight Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
dwight You did this, didn't you?
jim Absolutely not.
dwight Yes you did.
jim No I didn't.
dwight I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
jim Killer nanorobots?
pam It's an epidemic.
dwight The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. "Count Choculitis"
jim Sounds tough.
dwight Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
jim Do you?
dwight I think you need to confess.
jim Mmm hmm.
dwight . the fact.
jim Yep.
dwight What are you doing? Those are my keys.
jim Good luck.
dwight Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let.
stanley . the light green or green.

jan Where's michael Scott?
dwight He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
jan Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?

stanley Oh, thanks.
michael There you go.

michael Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um. because you didn't expect it. But you will. you'll know it when you see it.
dwight Michael. Michael?
michael Oh, Christ.
dwight I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
dwight I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
stanley What about confidentiality?
dwight You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted pen1s.
meredith Could you mean v*g1n*? Because if you do, I want that covered.
dwight I thought your v*g1n* was removed during your hysterectomy?
meredith A uterus is different from a v*g1n*. I still have a v*g1n*.
dwight OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?

kevin What is he doing?
oscar I don't know.
oscar Well?
michael Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
oscar OK, the health care plan.
pam Why did you put dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
michael Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
dwight I most certainly did not.
michael Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah. Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but jan needs it by five, and. what time is it, what time is it? Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
angela What about the surprise?
michael Oh. Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
stanley We all think you don't have a surprise.
michael All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And. here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is. Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll. Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
michael When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and ryan Stiles.
michael God, yeah. Ah! This.
