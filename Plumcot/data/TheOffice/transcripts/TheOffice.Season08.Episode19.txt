pam_beesly This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
kevin_malone Nice.
pam_beesly There's this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it's not -- it doesn't sound cool. You just have to see it.
pam_beesly Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal.
jim_halpert Wow. It's the end of an era.
pam_beesly Did a good job, Buddy. Now it's time to come home.
oscar_martinez I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
kevin_malone When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
ryan_howard How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin?
kevin_malone I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, "Look, a balloon."
dwight_schrute My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
meredith_palmer My kid didn't have a face tattoo.
darryl_philbin I was still thinking of going back to school.
jim_halpert And I was still just a paper salesman.
dwight_schrute Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here.
all@ Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon.
jim_halpert Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
kevin_malone oooh
darryl_philbin Me.
phyllis_vance Yeah.
dwight_schrute Right here.
nellie_bertram Allow me to solve your problem, then.
jim_halpert Nellie
nellie_bertram Mmm. Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
jim_halpert What brings you to town?
nellie_bertram Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
dwight_schrute What?
dwight_schrute How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
toby_flenderson Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
nellie_bertram Mm.
pam_beesly What?
toby_flenderson I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
pam_beesly You messed up saying your name?
toby_flenderson It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
nellie_bertram That one looks empty.
jim_halpert No, that's Andy's office.
nellie_bertram Oh, is it?
nellie_bertram I have one simple philosophy in business if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
erin_hannon Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Alonzo#unknown#TheOffice.Season08.Episode19 Good morning Erin.
erin_hannon How are you? How's your family doing?
erin_hannon Bye.
erin_hannon Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. Listen to me, bragging away.
robert_california Nellie.
nellie_bertram Robert.
robert_california How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
nellie_bertram So far, so good.
robert_california Good.
nellie_bertram Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
robert_california Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?
nellie_bertram Mm-hm.
robert_california Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?
nellie_bertram Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
robert_california We have a manager.
nellie_bertram Do you really? Because it is 10 00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
robert_california Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?
kevin_malone Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
andy_bernard Hello.
robert_california Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?
andy_bernard Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
robert_california I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately.
andy_bernard Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
andy_bernard ...Florida Flu.
robert_california He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
andy_bernard I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
robert_california Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
jim_halpert Can't you do something about this?
robert_california Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.
jim_halpert -Right.
jim_halpert What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
irene Erin, you got a package.
erin_hannon I'm in the bathroom.
glenn Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label.
irene Did you wash your hands?
erin_hannon Yes.
erin_hannon and Irene
andy_bernard Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
erin_hannon Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
andy_bernard Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
irene Where's the ring?
andy_bernard Hm?
irene Where's the ring, Lancelot?
erin_hannon Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
erin_hannon Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
glenn Why won't she go with him?
irene I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome.
erin_hannon Hey... don't listen.
nellie_bertram So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
jim_halpert I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
nellie_bertram So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. But why, m'lady? Because I am your new manager.
pam_beesly Robert, is Nellie our new manager?
robert_california This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
robert_california We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
nellie_bertram I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
kevin_malone Hot tub party?
nellie_bertram Performance reviews.
pam_beesly How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
nellie_bertram On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
glenn Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.
erin_hannon Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
irene So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?
andy_bernard Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
erin_hannon So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
irene I think you should leave, young man.
andy_bernard All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
erin_hannon You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
jim_halpert Any luck?
pam_beesly No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
andy_bernard Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
erin_hannon Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there.
irene You should take it. It's probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.
andy_bernard Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
irene You really wouldn't feel those kinds of results after one session.
andy_bernard I don't know. Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
irene You could put it on silent.
andy_bernard I don't think it does that.
irene Just go to preferences, then click â€“
glenn Proctology.
jim_halpert Andy?
andy_bernard Jim?
jim_halpert Andy, where are you?
andy_bernard I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
irene He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.
jim_halpert What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
andy_bernard What do you mean, take my job?
jim_halpert Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
andy_bernard Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
jim_halpert Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
angela_martin Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
pam_beesly I like working here.
jim_halpert Dwight, should she be our manager?
dwight_schrute I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
dwight_schrute Those who can't farm, farm celery.
jim_halpert And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever?
nellie_bertram All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
nellie_bertram Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
dwight_schrute I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
nellie_bertram Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
dwight_schrute What?
nellie_bertram Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
dwight_schrute There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
nellie_bertram Then you accept it?
dwight_schrute Five percent. No less.
nellie_bertram Absolutely not. Seven percent.
dwight_schrute Six percent, I know my worth.
jim_halpert The raise isn't real.
dwight_schrute Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
nellie_bertram So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
pam_beesly Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Pam.
nellie_bertram So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
phyllis_vance Really?
nellie_bertram Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
jim_halpert Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
robert_california I am not. Huh.
jim_halpert Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
robert_california Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?
jim_halpert Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
robert_california Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
jim_halpert Yes.
robert_california Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
jim_halpert Oh, god, nature, please.
robert_california When two animals are having s*x, one of them...
jim_halpert
robert_california ... is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
jim_halpert Was that not the--
robert_california All life is s*x. And all s*x is competition.
jim_halpert Mm-hm.
robert_california And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?
jim_halpert Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
robert_california My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
jim_halpert No. I would've said no.
nellie_bertram Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
kelly_kapoor Oh, great.
jim_halpert I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
dwight_schrute No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
darryl_philbin No.
dwight_schrute Yes.
darryl_philbin No.
dwight_schrute Yes.
darryl_philbin No.
dwight_schrute Yes.
darryl_philbin No.
dwight_schrute Yes.
darryl_philbin No.
dwight_schrute Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
dwight_schrute Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
dwight_schrute Well fought. I accept the outcome.
creed_bratton Touch me and I'll sue.
erin_hannon I've heard that's amazing when it works.
andy_bernard Yeah, if I had my own--
erin_hannon Andy, I care about you and I think--
andy_bernard --sorry, you go.
erin_hannon No, go ahead.
andy_bernard Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
erin_hannon Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
andy_bernard You broke my heart too.
erin_hannon You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
andy_bernard I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
erin_hannon I know.
andy_bernard
nellie_bertram So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
pam_beesly Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
nellie_bertram That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
pam_beesly Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
nellie_bertram Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
pam_beesly Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
nellie_bertram You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
pam_beesly No.
nellie_bertram Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
pam_beesly I think... you're a witch.
nellie_bertram I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it "I'm amazing."
pam_beesly I'm amazing.
irene Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy.
erin_hannon Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
irene I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink--
erin_hannon Irene, what would you do without me?
irene We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot.
erin_hannon Why?
irene He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
nellie_bertram Jim, time for your review.
jim_halpert No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
nellie_bertram Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
jim_halpert Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
nellie_bertram Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
jim_halpert Yes.
nellie_bertram I'm Tinkerbell.
jim_halpert No.
nellie_bertram Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
stanley_hudson And we are grateful.
nellie_bertram But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
jim_halpert She dies.
nellie_bertram She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
jim_halpert Let's see it. Show of hands.
kevin_malone I do. Come on everyone...
jim_halpert All right, guys, stop.
meredith_palmer I already spent the money.
jim_halpert How?
kevin_malone Come on Jim, you're killing her!
all@ We believe! We believe!
robert_california Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe.
andy_bernard That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
erin_hannon Andy wait! Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I'm sorry.
andy_bernard Erin!
erin_hannon Andy.
erin_hannon Let's get out of here.
andy_bernard Okay.
erin_hannon Let's go.
andy_bernard Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
erin_hannon No, I don't have any stuff.
andy_bernard Like your toothbrush and stuff.
erin_hannon I don't have one.
andy_bernard You don't have a toothbrush?
erin_hannon No.
andy_bernard How do you not have a toothbrush?
erin_hannon I just... there's always one around.
andy_bernard You just use whichever one is sitting there?
erin_hannon I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
andy_bernard Of course. I own my toothbrush.
nellie_bertram I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
