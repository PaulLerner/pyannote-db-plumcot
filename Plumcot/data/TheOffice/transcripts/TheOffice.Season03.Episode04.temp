dwight Awesome!

dwight Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
michael Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.
dwight Okay. Whoo!
michael There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
pam Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?
michael There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
pam But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better. ryan and
others Yeah. Yes, it's better. It's great.
michael All right. Okay.
michael I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.
pam With cream and sugar?
michael All right.
jan So, I wanted to let you know that we lost Ed Truck.
michael Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?
jan Michael, Ed died over the weekend.
michael Oh, wow.
michael Attention, everybody. I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first. My old boss Ed Truck has died.
kelly Oh, Michael, that's such terrible news! You must feel so sad.
michael Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.
phyllis That's a shame. Ed was a good guy.
michael That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up.
michael So did you hear the news?
pam The news that you just announced? That Ed died?
michael Yeah.
pam Is there anything I can do?
michael Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's. pssssh. . He was almost 70. Circle of life.
pam Yeah.
michael 
pam Oh. Okay.
michael Yeah. Mmmmmm.
pam Okay.
josh What's going on with Fairfield County schools? Karen, did you generate that price list?
karen Um, shoot. Uh, I will. Sorry.
josh Okay, just get it done. Jim, will you make sure?
jim Oh yeah, definitely.
andy Suck up! Josh, did you hear what I said?
josh Thank you, everyone.
karen Dammit.
jim What's up?
karen Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips.
jim Oh.
karen But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.
jim Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please.
creed It's a real shame about Ed, huh?
michael Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.
creed About what?
michael The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.
creed Ed was decapitated.
michael What?
dwight Really?
creed He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off.
michael Oh my God.
dwight That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.
creed You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
dwight You're thinking of a chicken.
creed What did I say?
michael That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.
michael So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this.
dwight Ed was decapitated.
michael What are you doing?
dwight You said you didn't know how to say it.
michael I didn't. he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
dwight Hey.
angela Hi.
dwight If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
angela I do not wanna talk about this.
dwight When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
michael I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.
jan I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?
michael You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
jan Well, what would you suggest?
michael A statue.
jan Of Ed?
michael Yeah.
jan I'm not sure that's realistic.
michael Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
jan No, that's not---
michael We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move.
dwight That is not a statue, that is a robot.
michael I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
dwight And how big do you want this robot?
michael Life-size.
dwight Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.
jan What the hell are you two talking about?
michael Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
jan You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today.
michael Mm hm.
jan . and I have to get back to work.
michael Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
jan So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.
michael But Ed truck can't because he is---
jan Goodbye.
michael DEAD.
dwight Look I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
michael That's perfect.
jim Okay, that is a "no" on the on the West Side Market.
karen Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now?
jim Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter.
karen I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want.
jim Really?
karen Yeah, all day.
andy Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.
jim Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
andy Did you check the vending machine?
karen Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that?
jim I have no idea. We went right for the copier.
karen Mm.
jim And then we checked the fax machine.
karen Yeah, nothing there.
andy Did you check your. butt? . push;
michael Oohh. can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.
phyllis Okay that's enough.
michael What?
stanley We do not wanna hear about this.
michael Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home. wham! His cappa is detated from his head!
stanley You have just spit on my face.
michael Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
michael There are five stages to grief, which are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.
michael I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And. it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears. and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer. and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone. and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly. terribly alone.
roy Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.
michael Okay, fine. Hurry back.
roy There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the "grief counseling" session.
pam Oh. I would like a break.
roy How are you likin' the new car?
pam Great.
roy Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags?
pam I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.
roy Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah.
jim Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't . . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number. six. Wait, no. I'll call you back. Shut up .
karen Six?
michael Okay, we can start. Um.
pam You waited for me?
michael Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
dwight I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
michael Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.
stanley Nope.
michael Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.
stanley I will NOT.
michael Okay. I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
pam Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.
michael Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.
ryan Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all. took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.
michael Do you want to talk about it anymore?
ryan Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.
kevin Me, me, me, me, me me. Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so.
michael Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's. Do you think that this is a game?
phyllis Well, there is a ball.
michael All right, we're starting over.
stanley No, I'm done.
michael You are not leaving. No! We are not done.
angela We really have a lot of work to do right now.
michael Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk.
toby Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going.
michael How do you know?
toby What?
michael That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?
toby It was obvious.
michael Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!
dwight Michael! Michael. michael .
michael Oh, God!
dwight Oh.
michael Oh my God! Oh my God, come on .
dwight Poor little fella.
michael Oh shhhh--oot!
dwight He is a goner.
michael No, he's not.
dwight Yeah.
michael No, he's not.
dwight Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!
michael Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!
angela A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!
michael We don't know if it's dead.
kelly Ugh, no that thing is dead.
dwight You want me to flush him?
michael Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p. m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.
meredith I have a lot of work to do.
michael Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.
angela But.
michael No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now. Find a box for him.
karen I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.
jim Nice!
karen Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah. merci quand meme. Au revoir.
jim Sounded good.
karen Thanks.
kelly 
michael It's okay. It's okay. Shh. yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.
kelly I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight?
dwight Argh. gah!
michael What are. What are you doing?
dwight What? No, this is about the right size.
michael No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?
dwight I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
dwight I need a box. I need a box. A small box. not too confining.
pam Is it for the bird?
dwight Yeah.
pam I have it covered.
dwight Oh, thank you.
pam If you wanna do something for the funeral.
dwight Yes, please.
pam Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
dwight Excellent.
pam Do you have it with you?
dwight Always.
pam Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.
karen Where'd you find them?
jim Where'd I find what?
jim I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.
michael Glad you could all make it.
kelly You told us we had to.
michael Dwight, do you have the box?
pam Actually, I have it.
michael You made this? Wow. That's. that's very nice.
ryan When I was five my mom told me that my fish went to the hospital in the toilet and it never came back so we had a funeral for it. And I remember thinking "I'm a little too old for this. " And I was five.
pam I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.
michael Yes.
pam What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much. It's just a bird. " But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.
kevin Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny.
pam And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
dwight He's not a songbird.
michael Shhh.
pam An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten.
angela Amen.
dwight 
pam Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within. on the wings of love .
michael Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
dwight Let's get back to work.
