dwight_schrute I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
kevin_malone You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
dwight_schrute They're still good for another week.
meredith_palmer You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like.
kevin_malone I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes.
dwight_schrute Hardy har har. Okay picture this Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
jim_halpert Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
dwight_schrute No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
jim_halpert Three months.
dwight_schrute Could be.
jim_halpert Four months.
dwight_schrute I can see that happening, yes.
jim_halpert Eight months?
dwight_schrute That's a realistic time line.
jim_halpert Eleven months.
dwight_schrute Perhaps.
jim_halpert Okay now really think hard about this one One year.
dwight_schrute I can see that as a very real possibility.
jim_halpert Four hundred and ninety-four months?
dwight_schrute I can see that happening.
jim_halpert Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
todd_packer I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
michael_scott Still not seeing the problem here.
todd_packer All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
michael_scott It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
holly_flax Hi!
michael_scott Hi.
holly_flax You must be Todd.
todd_packer Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
holly_flax Very funny. Okay let's get started.
todd_packer After you!
michael_scott Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
michael_scott Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
holly_flax All right.
michael_scott And it also helps if you've had five shots.
holly_flax I already have.
michael_scott Whoa!
jim_halpert Why is Packer back?
michael_scott Is Packer here?
dwight_schrute Why's he talking to Holly?
michael_scott Don't know, don't care.
holly_flax Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
todd_packer Oh!
michael_scott Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
kevin_malone Yes!
jim_halpert What!?
todd_packer It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
kevin_malone Nice! We got burned!
michael_scott You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
dwight_schrute Holly, you approved this?
holly_flax Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
jim_halpert You did approve it?
holly_flax Yeah.
kevin_malone What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
kevin_malone I have very little patience for stupidity.
erin_hannon Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
gabe_lewis I'm such a klutz!
erin_hannon Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
pam_beesly I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! Right?
erin_hannon Thank you Pam.
pam_beesly Awwh, you're welcome. My pleasure.
jim_halpert Can I do something for ya?
pam_beesly I just helped someone out. It feels good.
jim_halpert Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
pam_beesly So you know the feeling.
michael_scott Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
dwight_schrute I didn't order anything.
michael_scott And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
dwight_schrute Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
michael_scott So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here.
todd_packer Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
dwight_schrute I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
todd_packer well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
dwight_schrute No it is not.
todd_packer Is too!
michael_scott Let's look at this.
todd_packer Check it out!
dwight_schrute I don't wanna move desks!
michael_scott Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! 
jim_halpert Do I have any say in this?!
michael_scott No!
todd_packer Don't even watch, Halpert!
dwight_schrute Hey, who's dirt box is this?
holly_flax Oh, that's our Zen garden.
dwight_schrute What do you grow in here, bullcrap?
pam_beesly Hey, um...
holly_flax Hey, what's up guys?
meredith_palmer Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
jim_halpert Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
holly_flax Uhm.
pam_beesly He's seriously awful!
holly_flax Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
meredith_palmer That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
jim_halpert Why are you nodding?
pam_beesly United front...
holly_flax Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
ryan_howard Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
kelly_kapoor What are you referencing?
ryan_howard Everything... Everything.
holly_flax Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
jim_halpert Well, I mean he humped Michael.
holly_flax Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too.
andy_bernard Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
erin_hannon Hey sailor! Come watch it over here!
andy_bernard Where did you get this?!
erin_hannon Pam gave it to me!
andy_bernard This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
pam_beesly You have a computer Andy.
andy_bernard Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
pam_beesly Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
andy_bernard Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
pam_beesly Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
stanley_hudson So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
andy_bernard I'm not asking for one, I need it.
phyllis_vance If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
andy_bernard Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
pam_beesly See, this is what I'm talking about.
andy_bernard What are you gonna play mange on faster?
pam_beesly Sorry Andy.
todd_packer Hey what's going on you guys? Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
kevin_malone Mean but good!
holly_flax So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
todd_packer I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom.
holly_flax Well, some girls go through a phase.
kevin_malone Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
todd_packer Since when did you learn how to read?
kevin_malone I do know how to read though!
todd_packer Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
kevin_malone He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
dwight_schrute Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
pam_beesly What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
andy_bernard It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
pam_beesly What? Erin is that true?
erin_hannon I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
pam_beesly Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
andy_bernard Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
pam_beesly I'm not freaking out, Andy.
andy_bernard -take a few breaths, and then I ask myself Is this worth freaking out about?
pam_beesly Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
andy_bernard That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
pam_beesly Switch the computers back Andy.
andy_bernard Seriously?
pam_beesly Seriously.
andy_bernard Pam! Come on!
pam_beesly Now please.
andy_bernard Fine! Please make sure no one is humping me!
erin_hannon Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. Thanks.
michael_scott Best day ever. Best day ever!
holly_flax So much happening.
michael_scott Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
holly_flax No! No.
michael_scott Please.
holly_flax Did Todd tell you to do that?
michael_scott Yeah, You love him right? You love him. I can tell.
holly_flax I love you.
michael_scott No. Not me, him.
holly_flax That's certainly opinionated.
erin_hannon If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
holly_flax Oh I'm going.
michael_scott Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
holly_flax I don't think he's funnier than me.
michael_scott He's funnier than me.
holly_flax No, he's not funny at all.
michael_scott So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
erin_hannon Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
holly_flax No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
michael_scott Uhm...
holly_flax Ok Bill Cosby , Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here Todd Packer.
michael_scott That's insane!
holly_flax Honey, he's a jerk.
erin_hannon For Pete's sake it just needs to be done!
todd_packer So you two are married to each other now, right?
jim_halpert Yeah.
todd_packer That's sweet. How's the s*x?
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
todd_packer Why?
dwight_schrute 'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
jim_halpert That's a lot of reasons!
dwight_schrute Drink it!
todd_packer I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox.
jim_halpert Can I talk to you a second?
jim_halpert So, this hot chocolate thing.
dwight_schrute None of your business.
jim_halpert Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
dwight_schrute It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
jim_halpert I really think we should join forces on this one.
dwight_schrute Really.
jim_halpert What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
dwight_schrute I know.
jim_halpert Here we go.
dwight_schrute Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
jim_halpert You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
dwight_schrute Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
jim_halpert Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
dwight_schrute Who is Justice Beaver?
jim_halpert He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
dwight_schrute Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
jim_halpert Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
dwight_schrute Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
andy_bernard Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
pam_beesly I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
andy_bernard Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
pam_beesly You did that?
andy_bernard Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
pam_beesly Okay. When did people sign-
andy_bernard Mind if I close the door? What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
pam_beesly Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
andy_bernard You humiliated me in front of every body!
pam_beesly Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
andy_bernard I mean, it's pretty broken already.
pam_beesly Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
andy_bernard Pretty sneaky sis.
ryan_howard Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve.
dwight_schrute There are over four hundred of these!
jim_halpert Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
dwight_schrute They're all good. So good! Number three eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
jim_halpert One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
dwight_schrute Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
andy_bernard Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. Why are you doing this to me Andy? Because I hate your programs!
todd_packer And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that.
michael_scott And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.
todd_packer Why?
michael_scott I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
todd_packer Holly said that?
michael_scott Yeah.
creed_bratton She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
michael_scott I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
todd_packer She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
michael_scott You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
todd_packer Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
michael_scott No it isn't.
todd_packer You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
michael_scott Yeah, a little bit.
todd_packer Don't give up on me.
michael_scott I won't.
michael_scott Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
kevin_malone I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
michael_scott Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
kevin_malone That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
michael_scott Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
todd_packer I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
kevin_malone Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
michael_scott Kevin, do you accept the apology?
kelly_kapoor Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
michael_scott Okay, go back to the annex.
kelly_kapoor This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
ryan_howard Sometimes you over react.
oscar_martinez Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
todd_packer Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
michael_scott That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
angela_martin No! Don't!
michael_scott I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
pam_beesly So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
andy_bernard No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
pam_beesly Andy, this is the deal we made.
andy_bernard That's probably good. That's enough.
pam_beesly We should break this hinge maybe.
andy_bernard Let's not go crazy.
todd_packer Well thanks, will do.
jim_halpert Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.
todd_packer That sounds weird.
jim_halpert It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
dwight_schrute And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
jim_halpert Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
dwight_schrute Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
todd_packer Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
dwight_schrute Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
michael_scott What are you doing?
jim_halpert All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now!
michael_scott I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
jim_halpert He's a jerk.
dwight_schrute He took my desk.
michael_scott Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
dwight_schrute It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
michael_scott You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
dwight_schrute No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
michael_scott He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
jim_halpert Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about?
andy_bernard Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
pam_beesly Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
andy_bernard Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
pam_beesly Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse.
andy_bernard All right, well thank you for my garbage computer.
todd_packer You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the "ass", in Tallahassee!
michael_scott Yes, about that.
todd_packer Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
michael_scott Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
todd_packer Do you have a ball and chain?
michael_scott No, nothing like that at all.
todd_packer Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
michael_scott Sorry?
todd_packer I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local talent.
michael_scott Sounds great.
todd_packer It's gonna be so good.
michael_scott That is. It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
holly_flax I'm sorry about your friend.
michael_scott Nah, he's an ass.
holly_flax You ahh.
michael_scott You ahh.
holly_flax What ah you wicked smaht?
michael_scott No you ahh.
holly_flax Who ahh?
michael_scott You ahh.
darryl_philbin So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
pam_beesly Yep. Lucked out.
darryl_philbin Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.
pam_beesly Yep, super lucky.
darryl_philbin Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
pam_beesly Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
darryl_philbin Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.
pam_beesly Three.
pam_beesly I'm full on corrupt!
