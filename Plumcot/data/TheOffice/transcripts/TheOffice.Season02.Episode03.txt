michael_scott I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
ryan_howard I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
michael_scott Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
ryan_howard What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
michael_scott Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
ryan_howard I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
michael_scott Ok. Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
michael_scott Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
dwight_schrute Diversifying. Smart.
michael_scott Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
dwight_schrute And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
michael_scott Maybe.
jim_halpert
pam_beesly
pam_beesly Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
pam_beesly You see Dwight's coffee mug?
jim_halpert Mm-hmm.
pam_beesly Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
jim_halpert No way. Let's do this Oh.
pam_beesly Here.
jim_halpert Wind.
pam_beesly Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
jim_halpert Perfect.
pam_beesly Oh.
jim_halpert Oh.
dwight_schrute You should go.
michael_scott Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
dwight_schrute Uh huh.
michael_scott Sign the papers at the condo.
dwight_schrute You have your lawyer there?
michael_scott Uh, I don't need one.
dwight_schrute Can I be your representative?
michael_scott I don't need a representative.
dwight_schrute I think I should be there.
michael_scott No, No.
dwight_schrute I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
michael_scott No. Dwight. I'm fine.
dwight_schrute Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
michael_scott Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
dwight_schrute So you're taking a personal day?
michael_scott Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
dwight_schrute Please, I'll make you proud.
michael_scott Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
dwight_schrute Yes! As your representative?
michael_scott As my associate.
dwight_schrute Same thing.
michael_scott No it is not.
dwight_schrute I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
michael_scott Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.
pam_beesly You headed out?
michael_scott We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
pam_beesly Ok.
michael_scott Very good.
pam_beesly Have a great time.
michael_scott We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
pam_beesly Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
michael_scott Good. The Small Business Man?
pam_beesly Yup.
michael_scott Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
pam_beesly Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
michael_scott How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
pam_beesly
michael_scott NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you.
pam_beesly Yeah.
michael_scott Ok. See you soon.
dwight_schrute What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
michael_scott I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
dwight_schrute I want to put the top down.
michael_scott What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...
dwight_schrute But then no one can see us.
michael_scott I... Just... Would you put it up? Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
dwight_schrute Check it out. Terminator.
michael_scott I do not understand what you spend your money on.
kevin_malone Ooh.
jim_halpert Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
oscar_martinez Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.
jim_halpert What does 2005 season mean?
oscar_martinez Eh.
jim_halpert Wait a minute, what is this?
oscar_martinez It's a scoreboard.
jim_halpert What?
oscar_martinez Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
jim_halpert Really?
oscar_martinez Yeah.
kevin_malone Or when we're bored.
jim_halpert Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years.
kevin_malone We're bored a lot.
jim_halpert OH!
kevin_malone Oh!
oscar_martinez Sweet!
jim_halpert Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.
kevin_malone We call it Hate Ball.
jim_halpert Why?
kevin_malone Because of how much Angela hates it.
jim_halpert Hey, do you guys have any other games?
kevin_malone Sometimes we play "Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?"
angela_martin You play that.
oscar_martinez You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
michael_scott Home, sweet home.
dwight_schrute Which one's yours?
michael_scott Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
jim_halpert So that's what this sound is all day.
carol_stills Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
michael_scott Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
bill Nice to meet you.
michael_scott Nice to meet you too.
dwight_schrute This is smaller than your old place.
michael_scott Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
dwight_schrute Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x.
carol_stills Are we ready to sign some papers?
dwight_schrute Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
bill It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles.
carol_stills It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
michael_scott Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
dwight_schrute Let's go check out the master bedroom.
jim_halpert Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
stanley_hudson Yeah, I got a game. It's called "work hard so my kids can go to college."
jim_halpert Fair enough.
michael_scott This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
dwight_schrute Oh. Terrible idea.
michael_scott I'm putting my bed right over here.
dwight_schrute No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
michael_scott Well, then I will get a warrantee.
dwight_schrute Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
michael_scott Well then I won't get a warrantee.
dwight_schrute Shh Shh.
michael_scott So that's the problem, is solved. What?
dwight_schrute Listen. Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
jim_halpert This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
kevin_malone It smells like cookies.
jim_halpert Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
pam_beesly Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
angela_martin I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
jim_halpert Let the games begin.
carol_stills And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
dwight_schrute What kind of mortgage did you get?
michael_scott Uh... Ten year.
carol_stills Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
michael_scott What? Wha? You said ten.
carol_stills Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
dwight_schrute Ho, thirty years.
michael_scott Ok, ok, ok.
dwight_schrute Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
michael_scott Alright.
dwight_schrute Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
michael_scott Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
dwight_schrute Well, this is it.
carol_stills Whenever you're ready.
michael_scott Um. Oh. Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
carol_stills Actually yes.
dwight_schrute Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
michael_scott Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
dwight_schrute We'll be here waiting for you.
michael_scott Oh, man.
dwight_schrute A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
carol_stills Whenever you're ready, Michael.
michael_scott Uh.
jim_halpert You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
pam_beesly Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.
jim_halpert Hum.
pam_beesly In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.
jim_halpert Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
pam_beesly The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
jim_halpert So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
phyllis_vance I'll do it.
jim_halpert Yes! Phyllis! Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk.
michael_scott The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...
carol_stills What?
michael_scott ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
carol_stills Michael, this is the unit you saw and...
michael_scott Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
carol_stills Who told you that?
michael_scott As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.
michael_scott There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.
carol_stills Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
michael_scott No, no, no.
carol_stills That's some extra income for you.
michael_scott I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
carol_stills You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.
michael_scott Ehhhh....
michael_scott I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
dwight_schrute Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
jim_halpert Here we go. Here we go.
pam_beesly Go! Go! Go!
oscar_martinez Pair of shoes!
jim_halpert Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
pam_beesly It's Phyllis!
jim_halpert Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
pam_beesly Flonkerton.
jim_halpert Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
meredith_palmer Wow!
kevin_malone
jim_halpert Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
michael_scott There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
dwight_schrute You didn't have to...
michael_scott No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
michael_scott Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
dwight_schrute I don't even know what to say.
michael_scott I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
dwight_schrute Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
michael_scott What the hell is a terrarium?
dwight_schrute It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
michael_scott Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
dwight_schrute Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
pam_beesly Are you sure you don't want to play?
angela_martin I'm sure.
pam_beesly Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
angela_martin I have one, yes.
pam_beesly Well, let's play, what is it?
angela_martin I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
pam_beesly We're friends.
angela_martin Apparently.
jim_halpert Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
phyllis_vance Are you calling me a ho?
jim_halpert Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
dwight_schrute Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
michael_scott We take separate cars.
dwight_schrute Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
michael_scott Why would we do that?
dwight_schrute Just for fun?
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
michael_scott EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.
dwight_schrute Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
oscar_martinez Ah...
all@ OH!
jim_halpert Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
ryan_howard I did.
jim_halpert Ryan Howard. Ryan! Gold medal.
pam_beesly I made something for our closing ceremonies.
jim_halpert What? Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
pam_beesly Automatic voicemail.
jim_halpert Alright Pam, alright . Nice work!
pam_beesly
stanley_hudson A little bit more and I would have had it.
dwight_schrute You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.
michael_scott Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
dwight_schrute People love beets.
michael_scott Nobody likes beets.
dwight_schrute Everybody loves beets.
michael_scott Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
dwight_schrute Let's get this roof going.
michael_scott Stop it!
dwight_schrute Ow.
jim_halpert Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1 15.
stanley_hudson Oscar!
all@ Go! Go! Go!
jim_halpert Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. Guys?
dwight_schrute What is going on?
jim_halpert Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
dwight_schrute That's my stopwatch.
jim_halpert Here you go. All done.
oscar_martinez Great.
jim_halpert Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
ryan_howard I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly I have 59 voicemails.
jim_halpert Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
pam_beesly Sure.
jim_halpert Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
pam_beesly Really?
jim_halpert Notify the athletes.
pam_beesly Cool.
jim_halpert Michael.
michael_scott Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
jim_halpert Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
michael_scott Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
jim_halpert Nice.
michael_scott You know.
jim_halpert Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
michael_scott Really?
michael_scott What's this?
jim_halpert These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.
michael_scott I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
jim_halpert And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
michael_scott Get up here, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Silver medal.
michael_scott Yep, not as good as gold. Why are you playing the national anthem?
jim_halpert Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
michael_scott Oh. What the hell is that?
jim_halpert Those are the doves.
