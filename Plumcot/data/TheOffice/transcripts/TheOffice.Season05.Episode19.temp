pam Yeah, that's no problem.
michael Pam?
pam Sure. Uh huh.
michael Pam? Knock, knock.
pam I'm on the phone.
michael I know you are. Knock, knock.
pam You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
michael 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
pam 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. It really makes us look unprofessional.
michael They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock.
pam Who's there?
michael Buddha.
pam Buddha who?
michael Buddha this bread for me, won't you?
pam Great.
michael I, I need something to wipe my hand.
pam Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
michael That was helping. It was classic.
dwight I got a knock-knock joke.
michael No. God.
dwight OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
michael Alright.
dwight Knock, knock.
michael Who's there?
dwight KGB.
michael KGB -
dwight We will ask the questions!
michael What the hell was that?
dwight What are you doing?
michael What are you doing?
dwight Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
michael You, you like that?
dwight C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
michael Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
jim Ding Dong.
michael Who's there?
jim KGB.
michael Dwight, get the door.
dwight I'm not answering it.
michael Answer the door.
jim Ding dong.
dwight No way, it's the KGB.
jim Ding dong.
dwight I'm not answering that. You answer it.
michael I'm not gonna answer it
dwight I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB.
jim The KGB will wait for no one!
dwight It's true.
pam Good morning, Michael.
michael Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
pam Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
michael Why thank you very much. Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
pam Jelly beans.
michael No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
michael The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
michael I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. Umm hmm.
jim We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
michael Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket. '
jim 'Free paper. '
michael No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
andy Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this.
michael No, you don't. No, it - What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
kevin I think I should call her.
andy No! No! No!
kevin Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
andy You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are. '
kevin But I do like her just the way she is.
andy Well that's not what we agreed on.
jim What are you doing?
andy Huh?
jim Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
andy No.
pam You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
andy You're asking him to give up all of his power.
jim What power?
kevin Andy, Pam, and jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
andy You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair. '
pam That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
jim Well guys with girlfriends don't.
andy That's low, Tuna.
jim Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. One of my clients found a golden ticket. Yup. No, congratulations.
michael Woo hoo.
jim I'll take that down right now.
michael Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips.
jim I'm on the phone.
michael . or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
jim Hold on one second.
michael Invite them on the tour.
jim It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
michael Really? That's kind of a big client. Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
oscar Ten percent?
michael Yeah?
oscar They're our largest client.
michael Yeah.
oscar It's gonna hurt.
jim Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
jim How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
michael I thought I did. So.
jim OK.
michael Well no harm no foul.
jim . well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
michael You didn't, but. it'll be fine. It'll be good.
michael Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
darryl Start over.
michael Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
darryl Were the boxes near each other?
michael Irrelevant.
darryl I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
michael OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
michael My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. That.
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi , David. No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
pam When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever. that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting. ' I'm gonna save that one.
michael Nobody panic. The good news is. they can't fire all of us, right?
oscar They can.
michael No, they can't.
oscar Yes, they can.
michael Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
oscar Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
michael Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
jim So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
michael Thank you, jim is with me.
jim Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
michael Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
creed That's not why.
michael OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. Yes.
pam Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?
jim Good one.
michael OK, don't get that. Please?
stanley I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
michael That is not constructive.
pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
michael Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
david Michael, what the hell is going on here?
michael How are you doing?
david Fine. What is going on?
michael My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
david Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
michael Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't. I don't know.
david How could you not know Michael?
michael I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
david Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
michael You're breaking up.
david Michael?
michael OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
david Was it the sales department?
michael Yes.
david Was it Jim?
michael No.
david OK, was it Dwight?
michael Yes.
michael Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
dwight That was your idea.
michael Woah, wow, who told you that?
dwight You did. Several times. Over and over again.
michael No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
dwight You were dressed as Willy Wonka so.
michael I'm not taking. I'm not taking.
dwight Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
michael Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
dwight You don't keep a diary.
michael Yes I do. You've just never seen it. March 4th. dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
dwight Hold that thought. March. 4th. michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
michael Why do you have a diary?
dwight To keep secrets from my computer.
michael OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
dwight Impossible.
michael Yes, you did.
dwight I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So. do the math.
michael What are you writing?
dwight Had conversation with michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
michael Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
dwight With all my heart. . push;
kevin You guys are throwing a lot at me.
jim All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
kevin Right.
pam I don't think jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
jim No, that is what I mean.
pam Shush. Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
kevin Like that?
jim No, stop it.
andy Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
andy . turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
michael We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
dwight OK, what am I thinking right now?
michael Umm, nacho chips.
dwight No. How skin is the largest organ of the body.
michael Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
dwight Oh, not gonna happen.
dwight I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
michael Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
dwight What about Shoe La La?
michael It's not ready yet.
michael I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
michael May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
oscar These aren't announcements.
michael Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
dwight I love working here and I do not want to leave.
michael He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
dwight Well.
michael I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion.
dwight We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
michael Right.
dwight No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
michael That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
dwight Try me.
michael That's why you made the decision. That's why you made.
dwight I haven't made a decision yet.
michael You kind of have.
dwight No.
michael Yes.
jim You cannot take the fall for him.
dwight He said he would do the same for me.
jim He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
dwight I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
jim There it is.
michael Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
david That's too bad.
michael Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
david Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight.
dwight David. you're welcome.
david I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. dwight Schrute?
david Alright Dwight. This is huge.
dwight That's what she said!
michael Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
dwight Inspiration.
michael Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?
dwight You never know when it's gonna strike. Just. boom.
michael Give me the details of how that happened.
jim You, you are taking about dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
michael What?
jim And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
dwight Apology rejected.
pam Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
dwight Oh Pam.
creed Good work, kid.
dwight Thanks old man.
david This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
dwight Yeah.
david Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
pam Sure.
michael David? David?
dwight 'Cause I've got this idea.
michael David?
david Yeah?
michael Could I be a part of the meeting also?
david You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
jim Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie.
dwight Alright.
david Hey guys, I have with me dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
dwight OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka. Man on
phone Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there? I hear panting.
david No. No dogs.
dwight So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea .
michael There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
pam It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
dwight Pam.
michael I can't. vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
dwight That is my idea.
david We are gonna call you back guys. What is going on here?
michael OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
david No, no.
dwight It is my idea.
michael Oh how dare you.
dwight It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
michael You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
dwight Horse Boat.
michael Oh please.
dwight A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
michael Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge.
dwight Oh give me a break.
michael . that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
dwight That's because they're easy!
michael They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
dwight Women's urinals. uh.
david Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
dwight Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
michael Thank You!
david What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
michael Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
david OK, uhh. I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
pam OK.
david I am gone.
michael When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
dwight Oh I am. In my own words.
michael I want to see it.
dwight No.
michael I want to see it.
dwight No, Michael.
michael Give me. Give me the diary.
dwight No!
lynn Hi.
kevin Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
lynn OK.
kevin I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
lynn OK.
kevin Nice. Boobs.
andy Well, it's uh, his funeral. So. neh!
dwight Ding dong.
jim Who is it?
dwight KGB.
jim Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
dwight When you are done, open the door. . Hello in there?
jim Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
dwight We have more houses to visit.
jim If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
dwight We will come back at. how is 4
 45?
jim I get back from work around 6.
dwight How about 5

jim You can try. That, that might work.
dwight Very well, we will come back at 5
 15.
jim Alright.
