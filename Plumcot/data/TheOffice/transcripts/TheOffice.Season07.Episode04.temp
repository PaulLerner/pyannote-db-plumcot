dwight I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p. m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.

michael There are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work. He is a fan of the outrageous. He loves to surprise! He loves. other things as well.
phyllis God! Wow!
michael Look, It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
phyllis That's no pimple Michael.
michael You mean cancer?
pam What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
pam It's just good to stop a michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town.
meredith Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's just a cold sore.
michael It is?
meredith Yup, just a cold sore.
michael Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
kevin I know how you got it.
michael How?
kevin michael come on. A cold sore is herpes.
michael What?
pam Wait! What you should do, Michael, is have a doctor take a look at it. Because we really don't know what that is.
meredith I know tons and tons of people who have herpes. I have it myself. That's what it is.
kevin I never seen herpes on you.
meredith Because it's on my genitals, genius.
kevin You have a pen1s?
andy Michael, have you ever been tested for STDs?
michael Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
jim That was like, ten years ago.
michael No! It was like four years ago!
kevin Michael, you're at least forty six!
michael Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six.
kelly Can we please talk about how gross meredith is?
angela This is what you get when you treat your body like an outhouse.
andy You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
kelly I guess maybe you should go marry a meth dealer with crabs.
oscar I don't even wanna know these things!
meredith Hey guys!
michael How did this happen, how did I get this?
dwight Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
michael You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. It's me own damn fault. woman in every port.
dwight What port? The jan port. The holly Por.
michael Don't even! holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
dwight You may have.
michael Oh my God! What if I did?
dwight You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
michael Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
dwight You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
michael There's no way I'm gonna do that.
dwight Then I will.
michael 
dwight No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
donna Hello?
michael Hi Donna. It's Michael.
donna Michael, I didn't think I'd here from you. How have you been?
michael I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.

donna Oh my God.
michael . R-P-E-E-S
donna Wait, you're calling to tell me that you have herpes?
michael No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
donna Ummm, no.
michael Does your stupid husband have it?
donna No! He doesn't. Are you telling me I have to get tested?
michael Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
dwight So long Donna!
andy Excuse me everyone, can I have your attention please?
stanley Not again.
andy What do you mean again?
stanley You're always asking for our attention.
andy Maybe like a year ago.
stanley Seems recent.
andy No, that's.
oscar Andy, the reason it seems more recent is because many of us here have never stood up and asked for everyone's attention, and it seems like you've done it on several occasions.
andy Everyone, I've noticed that we have not been entirely kind to one of our own, due to stigmas and prejudices.
phyllis Oh! When you got your new phone, that's when you asked for everyone's attention.
stanley That's what I was thinking, you kept announcing scores.
andy It's the world's only international sport!
holly This is Holly.
michael No this is Holly.
holly No this is Holly.
michael No this is Holly.
holly No, this is michael Scott.
michael Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
holly I am calling because, there's a terrible crash!
michael Oh really? Was anyone killed?
holly A lot of people.
michael Any nuns?
holly Three nuns, from a Missionary in South Africa.
michael Were they in the missionary position?
andy Ba na na na na. Hot pizza, check it and see. Ba na na na. Got a whole bunch of pepperoni. Ba na na na na. Yeah, now you're looking at me. Anyone who's interested in entering into an honest discussion about the sexual mores and taboos of modern society will be rewarded with a pizza break.
michael Do you ever wonder what life would have been like if you hadn't been transferred?
holly Yeah.
michael We would have twins.
holly I don't think we'd have kids.
michael Mmhmm!
holly It was just for a few weeks!
michael Mhhmm! We would be married.
holly Michael, I have been dating A. J. for a year and a half now. You do this you know.
michael Do what?
holly You romanticize things.
michael I don't romanticize th- No.
holly Michael, you cried at that tagline for a movie you made up.
michael He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak. This is how he let a nation.
holly You made ourselves to be more than we were.
michael We were more than we were.
holly I don't know what you're getting so upset about, we had to break up a long time ago, it was a good memory.
michael Ok, alright I gotta go.
holly Michael.
dwight He forgot to mention the herpes.
michael It didn't come up organically.
jan . to accommodate the, uh, suppliers. Gentlemen! Nice to see you, it'll be just a moment. If you could show them into Conference Room B. The pharmaceutical aspects should be able to.
jan How do I do it? Raise my daughter, work as director of office purchasing for this hospital and release an album of Dorris Day covers on my own label? If I knew I'd tell you. . push;
michael It's nice to see you doing so well.
jan Yeah I'm really happy. Me and astrid against the world. We're loving it, yeah. I'm kind of a supermom.
michael Bringing home the bacon.
jan Yeah. Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget. I love that commercial.
dwight I don't understand the reference.
jan Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
dwight We had to come over right away, it's urgent. michael has something to tell you.
jan Are you gonna keep me in suspense?
michael Would you excuse us.
dwight Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
michael He hasn't changed.
jan No, so what couldn't wait?
michael Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
jan michael Scott, you are here for a post mortem.
michael What?
jan You wanna dig into our relationship, go over it, see what killed it. Ok, I'm in.
andy So, guys. I've been really bothered by the way certain people are getting treated around here, and I just think as an office we're better than that. Ok, now I'm going to show you a picture of genitalia.
erin Andy.
andy What, is it because he's black?
jim Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
andy Perfectly normal genitalia Tuna. Now I'm going to show you another picture of perfectly normal genitalia.
jim Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
andy It's normal! Big deal! Yeah sure it has some herpes on it, but you know what? It's just as normal as anyone else's.
jan No! In the beginning we were not good.
michael Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
jan Well if there's anything exciting about it it's because we both knew it was wrong!
michael Because we work together.
jan No, ok. Imagine there's a princess, who falls for a guy beneath her station, and the queen doesn't like this at all. And the princess knows that the queen doesn't like it so it just makes her wanna do it all the more just to get at the queen!
michael Am I the princess?
jan No I'm the princess, and the queen.
michael Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
astrid Mommy!
jan Assy! Awwhhh how was school?
astrid It was cool.
jan What did you learn?
astrid What did I learn?
jan You might have learned shapes, or blocks, or clocks, or colors. Or you might have learned that we're all, sisters and brothers.
michael I have herpes.
michael I used to think that she was the one. Or at least A the one. And if I called that one so wrong.
andy Herpes, like all STDS, is a consequence of s*x. Can anyone else name any other consequences?
kevin It feels unbelievable!
andy Ok I guess I can make a pros column. Feels.
kevin . unbelievable.
phyllis The ability to express love physically. It's a magical thing.
andy Express love, magical.
kevin It feels amazing!
andy Umm, ok is that different from feels unbelievable?
kevin Yes.
andy Then I will write it down.
creed The feeling of pure risk.
andy I actually had that down in the cons column, but.
creed It's thrilling.
andy Ok, umm. I'll move that. Thrill of risk.
erin Andy, aren't there also negatives to s*x?
andy Yes! Thank you! Such as?
erin Unplanned pregnancy.
andy Yes, unplanned pregnancy.
kelly Like jim and Pam, say whaaat?
kevin Just admit that your baby was a mistake.
pam Hey! Our baby was not a mistake. She was a surprise.
jim Good!
darryl I'm sure they don't regret having their child, let's move it to the pros. jim and
pam Thank you!
andy Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
dwight Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
michael You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She.
dwight jan knows paper.
michael No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
dwight Wait, what holly said?
michael Yes, I don't.
dwight Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
michael I know, I know.
dwight Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
michael Got it.
dwight TO answer your question about Jan, no. jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
michael I'M TRYING! GOD!
michael Hi stranger! Long time! Old
woman Who are you?
michael I'm Michael. We dated for a while. Old
woman I don't think so.
helene Michael?
michael Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
dwight Come on old lady. Let's go. Old
woman What is happening?
dwight Come on.
andy Who can tell me what the safest form of s*x is?
darryl Condoms.
andy Incorrect, the only true form of safe s*x, ok? Abstinence.
darryl Ohh. Ok. I didn't realize we were doing trick questions. What's the safest way to go skiing? Don't ski!
andy I just thought I'd bring it up in case someone in here was practicing abstinence. That's all. Anybody?
pam andy that's way too personal of a question.
andy Well someone could answer if they want to. Ok, in that case I will now show you how to put this condom on. using this pencil.
andy What?
oscar Why would you choose a pencil Andy?
andy Well I'm not gonna use my pen1s, Oscar! It's not exactly hard right now anyway.
meredith Come on, give it a rest pencil dick.
andy I'm doing this for you Meredith!
meredith I didn't want you it!
andy Well did you h- di- GAH! Does no one appreciate what I'm doing right now?!
helene It'll go away in time just don't touch it.
michael Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
helene What did you think we were?
michael Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you.
helene I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
michael Jerk.
dwight Michael!
carroll So this is the chef's kitchen, which makes it perfect for real entertainers.
michael Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
carroll Michael.
michael Carroll, how are you?
carroll I'm great! How are you?
michael I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
carroll You didn't call my office and ask where I was?
michael No.
carroll Because the receptionist told me a man called but he only said he was my ex-lover.
michael Weird.
carroll Yeah.
michael He sounds like a nice guy.
andy I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
gabe This wasn't really about meredith was it. You and erin are broken up.
andy How is that relevant to anything?
gabe I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand. ' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
andy The only reason I said that is because you asked me so politely! It was very difficult for me to say no.
gabe I'll let this slide, but I expect you to put this whole erin thing behind you.
michael Oh wow another living room!
carroll It's a family room.
michael You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
carroll michael why are you here?
michael Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
carroll You know, we all do that.
michael I have herpes.
carroll What? Did you have that while we were together?
michael I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
carroll Oh! Oh, that's what you're talking about?
michael Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
carroll Did the doctor check it out?
michael I'm between specialists right now.
carroll Yes, yes Michael. Actually you do make a bigger deal out of things than you need to. You proposed to me on our fourth date.
michael Well I believe in love at first sight.
carrol Well so do I, but we didn't love each other at first either. I don't know what you were thinking!
michael I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
dwight Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
carroll No.
darryl We should schedule meetings, because the days can slip away with chit-chat. Are you crying?
andy No I'm just sweating.
darryl I don't know who's got you upset but my advice is stop crying.
andy I'm not crying I'm just sweating.
darryl Look you need to pick yourself up. man up, alright? You will win this in the end. It's all about heart, and character. Be your best self.
andy Ok.
darryl Yeah.
darryl I have no idea what his problem is, that's just my standard advice. It's good advice right?
holly This is holly Flax, I can't come to the phone right now but please leave a message after the sound of the tiny truck backing up.
michael Hi holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
oscar What is this about?
michael Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
oscar Yes!
michael You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
oscar What?
michael Herpes duplex.
dwight It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
michael I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
oscar We were never lovers!
