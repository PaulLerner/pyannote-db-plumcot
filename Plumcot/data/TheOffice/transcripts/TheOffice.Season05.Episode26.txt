erin_hannon Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
jim_halpert Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5 00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
jim_halpert Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
pam_beesly I can do it.
dwight_schrute What do you need from me?
dwight_schrute Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
michael_scott
dwight_schrute Like clockwork.
jim_halpert Three, two, one...
michael_scott Uh oh. What's so funny?
pam_beesly You had to be there.
michael_scott Oh yay! Geography joke. Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
michael_scott See you later!
dwight_schrute Bye Michael! Yeah!
jim_halpert All right, you ready for this?
pam_beesly Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
jim_halpert Yeah.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Wait, should I have left the car running?
pam_beesly Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
jim_halpert Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
pam_beesly Tell them what happened last year.
jim_halpert I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
pam_beesly No, no, that guy who hit on me.
jim_halpert Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
pam_beesly Yeah, you don't grab these for balance.
jim_halpert Well...
dwight_schrute I'm gonna say 30.
rolf Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.
dwight_schrute Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
rolf Woah. Homemade?
dwight_schrute Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?
dwight_schrute Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
kevin_malone Michael, isn't that Holly?
michael_scott We're just friends. Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
holly_flax Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
michael_scott Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
holly_flax All right.
michael_scott All right. Mmhmm. Hey.
holly_flax Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
michael_scott A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
a_j Hey Michael.
michael_scott Hey. Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
holly_flax Lemonade sounds great.
michael_scott Okay.
a_j I'd love an iced tea, actually.
michael_scott You can go to hell. I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
michael_scott I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one "Holly, you and I are soup snakes." The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
charles_miner Jim. Pam.
jim_halpert Hey, how are you?
pam_beesly Hey Charles.
charles_miner Nice day, huh?
jim_halpert Yeah.
charles_miner Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest.
jim_halpert I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
pam_beesly Do you want me to beat him up for you?
jim_halpert No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
dwight_schrute Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
jim_halpert Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
dwight_schrute Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
andy_bernard Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
dwight_schrute Why? I don't understand.
andy_bernard If-
dwight_schrute Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
andy_bernard Uh...
dwight_schrute I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
andy_bernard That's...
dwight_schrute Sly dog.
andy_bernard ... not what I meant.
dwight_schrute Come on, folks!
michael_scott What is up with you two, Holly?
holly_flax Um, not much.
a_j We're designing a house.
michael_scott Cool. For who?
a_j For us.
michael_scott Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
holly_flax I remember your chair pants idea.
a_j I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
michael_scott All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
holly_flax Okay, yeah.
a_j You guys are really gonna do this?
michael_scott You bet your fat ass we are.
michael_scott Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
holly_flax Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
michael_scott That's right.
holly_flax Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
michael_scott Newspapers for sale!
andy_bernard Are you blind?! Are you blind?! Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
angela_martin These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.
andy_bernard Okay, I was just looking out for you. You're doing great, by the way.
erin_hannon Thanks.
kevin_malone I got it.
dwight_schrute Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
andy_bernard Are you blind?!
dwight_schrute I could've gotten that, idiot!
andy_bernard Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
dwight_schrute It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
phyllis_vance We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
dwight_schrute
dwight_schrute Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
toby_flenderson So what?
dwight_schrute Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
pam_beesly Back off, Dwight. Hyuh! What?
pam_beesly Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
pam_beesly Hyuh! Well, look at that, we win!
jim_halpert Nice job, Beesly.
dwight_schrute Yes! We advance to the next round!
phyllis_vance Oh, Lord in heaven.
stanley_hudson Had to be part of the group.
michael_scott I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
holly_flax Ooh, yes please. Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
michael_scott What?
holly_flax Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
michael_scott Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
holly_flax Crystal cool.
dwight_schrute Hit it Andy!
andy_bernard Bump! I bumped it!
kevin_malone Set!
dwight_schrute Don't set it to yourself!
kevin_malone Yeah!
phyllis_vance Ow, my ankle!
dwight_schrute What happened?
phyllis_vance I... twisted it.
dwight_schrute You weren't even moving. Okay, sub!
rochester_volleyball_player_2 I can play.
rolf Is there a... Meredith here?
meredith_palmer Yeah! Man in!
rochester_volleyball_player_2 Rolph, did you not hear me?
rolf I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go!
michael_scott We could do a movie... sort of thing.
holly_flax We could do Back to the Future.
michael_scott Oh!
holly_flax We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents.
michael_scott Could we get a Delorean?
holly_flax Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
michael_scott Oh! Dun-der. Dun-der...
holly_flax Dun-der. Dun-der...
michael_scott Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!
holly_flax Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
michael_scott No. No.
holly_flax Oh.
michael_scott We're circling it.
holly_flax Hmm...
david_wallace Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
charles_miner Yes we are!
rolf You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!
dwight_schrute Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait-
rolf It's true!
doctor_speaking_through_glass Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
kendall Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious.
doctor_speaking_through_glass Really, really funny.
kendall Really funny.
dwight_schrute Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate.
oscar_martinez Settle down gentlemen.
pam_beesly Good game!
david_wallace Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
michael_scott Uh, it's a sketch now.
david_wallace Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this.
michael_scott And now, presenting...
all@ SlumDunder Mifflinaire!
michael_scott
holly_flax Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
michael_scott Yes, I am.
holly_flax For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
michael_scott Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
holly_flax That is correct! How did you know that?!
michael_scott Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
holly_flax Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
michael_scott Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
holly_flax I'm Robert Dunder.
michael_scott I'm Robert Mifflin. Ah, okay.
holly_flax Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
michael_scott Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
holly_flax That is correct!
michael_scott Yes!
stanley_hudson I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
holly_flax The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
michael_scott I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
holly_flax That is correct!
angela_martin from Buffalo What is he talking about?
holly_flax How did you know that?!
michael_scott David Wallace told me!!
toby_flenderson from Buffalo David, is this true?
david_wallace Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
angela_martin from Buffalo Are we losing our jobs or not, David?
holly_flax They didn't know?
michael_scott I guess not.
david_wallace I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
toby_flenderson from Buffalo And?
david_wallace We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
angela_martin from Buffalo You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it.
david_wallace How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
michael_scott Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
david_wallace What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, "oh, this would be really funny."
michael_scott Thank you.
david_wallace Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, "is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?"
michael_scott Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
meredith_palmer Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
dwight_schrute Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
pam_beesly How do you figure?
dwight_schrute Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
oscar_martinez Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
pam_beesly Let's do this.
andy_bernard Jim, come on!
charles_miner Look who just woke up! I've been up for a while.
kevin_malone It's six to six. It's a nail-biter.
rochester_volleyball_player_2 Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
rolf Here's an accounting question for you what does one fiance plus one lover equal? Answer one whore.
dwight_schrute Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
rolf What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-
dwight_schrute Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
rolf No way! You don't mean that!
dwight_schrute Rolph, leave it alone!
erin_hannon Yeah! Boo-yah!
pam_beesly I got it!
dwight_schrute Pam!
pam_beesly Oof!
jim_halpert You all right?
pam_beesly Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.
jim_halpert You sure?
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Hey, easy, easy...
charles_miner Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
pam_beesly No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
charles_miner I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
david_wallace Yeah.
jim_halpert All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
charles_miner Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
jim_halpert No, uh-
pam_beesly Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
charles_miner Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
dwight_schrute Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
charles_miner I guess that's it for you, Jim.
jim_halpert All right, you know what? Let's do this.
pam_beesly We'll be back!
dwight_schrute Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! I'll get it.
michael_scott Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
holly_flax Hindsight.
michael_scott Should've had hindsight.
holly_flax How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
michael_scott I think it went well. I think it was good.
holly_flax There weren't any laughs.
michael_scott No, it was a tough audience.
holly_flax Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
michael_scott Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
holly_flax Well, I'm glad we did it.
michael_scott Me too. We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
holly_flax I can't wait.
jim_halpert Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
nurse To be safe, we should do an x-ray.
pam_beesly How long will that take?
nurse Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant...
pam_beesly I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
nurse Oh good, because my next question was "do you have a game to get back to."
holly_flax What'd you think?
a_j I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but...
michael_scott Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
holly_flax Okay. So good to see you.
michael_scott Good to see you. AJ.
a_j Michael.
michael_scott I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
david_wallace Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
charles_miner Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
dwight_schrute Okay. Fine.
charles_miner All right! Come on.
dwight_schrute Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
andy_bernard Dwight.
dwight_schrute No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
david_wallace Dwight.
dwight_schrute Seven? Can I finish please?
david_wallace Okay.
dwight_schrute Eight?
jim_halpert Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! Ohh!
