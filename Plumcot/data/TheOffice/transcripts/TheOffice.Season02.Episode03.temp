michael I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.
ryan I got your sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.
michael Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
ryan What was the thing, ah, you needed me to come in early for?
michael Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone, " "Risky Business. " Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
ryan I'm just going to take a nap in my car until work starts.
michael Ok. Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
michael Today, I, michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
dwight Diversifying. Smart.
michael Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
dwight And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
michael Maybe.
jim 
pam 
pam Every so often, jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.
pam You see Dwight's coffee mug?
jim Mm-hmm.
pam Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.
jim No way. Let's do this Oh.
pam Here.
jim Wind.
pam Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.
jim Perfect.
pam Oh.
jim Oh.
dwight You should go.
michael Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
dwight Uh huh.
michael Sign the papers at the condo.
dwight You have your lawyer there?
michael Uh, I don't need one.
dwight Can I be your representative?
michael I don't need a representative.
dwight I think I should be there.
michael No, No.
dwight I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
michael No. Dwight. I'm fine.
dwight Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
michael Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
dwight So you're taking a personal day?
michael Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
dwight Please, I'll make you proud.
michael Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
dwight Yes! As your representative?
michael As my associate.
dwight Same thing.
michael No it is not.
dwight I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.
michael Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.
pam You headed out?
michael We are. dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
pam Ok.
michael Very good.
pam Have a great time.
michael We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
pam Yeah, I changed them to your new address.
michael Good. The Small Business Man?
pam Yup.
michael Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
pam Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.
michael How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
pam 
michael NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you.
pam Yeah.
michael Ok. See you soon.
dwight What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
michael I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
dwight I want to put the top down.
michael What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't. please.
dwight But then no one can see us.
michael I. Just. Would you put it up? Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
dwight Check it out. Terminator.
michael I do not understand what you spend your money on.
kevin Ooh.
jim Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?
oscar Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.
jim What does 2005 season mean?
oscar Eh.
jim Wait a minute, what is this?
oscar It's a scoreboard.
jim What?
oscar kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.
jim Really?
oscar Yeah.
kevin Or when we're bored.
jim Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years.
kevin We're bored a lot.
jim OH!
kevin Oh!
oscar Sweet!
jim Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.
kevin We call it Hate Ball.
jim Why?
kevin Because of how much angela hates it.
jim Hey, do you guys have any other games?
kevin Sometimes we play "Who can put the most M&amp;M's in their mouth?"
angela You play that.
oscar You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.
michael Home, sweet home.
dwight Which one's yours?
michael Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back. wait. no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
jim So that's what this sound is all day.
carol Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.
michael Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
bill Nice to meet you.
michael Nice to meet you too.
dwight This is smaller than your old place.
michael Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
dwight Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x.
carol Are we ready to sign some papers?
dwight Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
bill It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles.
carol It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.
michael Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
dwight Let's go check out the master bedroom.
jim Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?
stanley Yeah, I got a game. It's called "work hard so my kids can go to college. "
jim Fair enough.
michael This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
dwight Oh. Terrible idea.
michael I'm putting my bed right over here.
dwight No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
michael Well, then I will get a warrantee.
dwight Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
michael Well then I won't get a warrantee.
dwight Shh Shh.
michael So that's the problem, is solved. What?
dwight Listen. Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
jim This scented candle . andle . andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom . room . room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.
kevin It smells like cookies.
jim Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.
pam Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.
angela I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.
jim Let the games begin. . push;
carol And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
dwight What kind of mortgage did you get?
michael Uh. Ten year.
carol Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.
michael What? Wha? You said ten.
carol Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
dwight Ho, thirty years.
michael Ok, ok, ok.
dwight Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
michael Alright.
dwight Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
michael Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
dwight Well, this is it.
carol Whenever you're ready.
michael Um. Oh. Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
carol Actually yes.
dwight Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
michael Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
dwight We'll be here waiting for you.
michael Oh, man.
dwight A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
carol Whenever you're ready, Michael.
michael Uh.
jim You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?
pam Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.
jim Hum.
pam In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.
jim Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.
pam The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.
jim So, who will be challenging kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?
phyllis I'll do it.
jim Yes! Phyllis! Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk.
michael The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't. I don't.
carol What?
michael . know if you showed me this same unit or not.
carol Michael, this is the unit you saw and.
michael Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
carol Who told you that?
michael As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.
michael There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.
carol Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.
michael No, no, no.
carol That's some extra income for you.
michael I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
carol You will lose $7, 000 if you walk away right now.
michael Ehhhh. .
michael I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
dwight Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
jim Here we go. Here we go.
pam Go! Go! Go!
oscar Pair of shoes!
jim Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
pam It's Phyllis!
jim phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
pam Flonkerton.
jim Thank you, delegate from Iceland.
meredith Wow!
kevin 
jim Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
michael There's something else dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
dwight You didn't have to.
michael No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
michael Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
dwight I don't even know what to say.
michael I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
dwight Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
michael What the hell is a terrarium?
dwight It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
michael Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
dwight Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
pam Are you sure you don't want to play?
angela I'm sure.
pam Come on Angela, don't you have a game?
angela I have one, yes.
pam Well, let's play, what is it?
angela I call it pam Pong. I count how many times jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.
pam We're friends.
angela Apparently.
jim Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.
phyllis Are you calling me a ho?
jim Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
dwight Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
michael We take separate cars.
dwight Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
michael Why would we do that?
dwight Just for fun?
michael No.
dwight Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
michael EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm . Ok.
dwight Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
oscar Ah.
everyone OH!
jim Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
ryan I did.
jim ryan Howard. Ryan! Gold medal.
pam I made something for our closing ceremonies.
jim What? Oh my god. Where did you have time to make that?
pam Automatic voicemail.
jim Alright Pam, alright . Nice work!
pam 
stanley A little bit more and I would have had it.
dwight You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.
michael Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
dwight People love beets.
michael Nobody likes beets.
dwight Everybody loves beets.
michael Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
dwight Let's get this roof going.
michael Stop it!
dwight Ow.
jim Final lap. Final lap. Time to beat is 1
 15.
stanley Oscar!
crowd Go! Go! Go!
jim Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come. Guys?
dwight What is going on?
jim Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
dwight That's my stopwatch.
jim Here you go. All done.
oscar Great.
jim Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
ryan I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?
jim Hey.
pam I have 59 voicemails.
jim Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
pam Sure.
jim Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
pam Really?
jim Notify the athletes.
pam Cool.
jim Michael.
michael Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going. What's going on?
jim Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo.
michael Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
jim Nice.
michael You know.
jim Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
michael Really?
michael What's this?
jim These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.
michael I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
jim And for dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
michael Get up here, Dwight.
dwight Silver medal.
michael Yep, not as good as gold. Why are you playing the national anthem?
jim Um. 'Cause your condo's in America.
michael Oh. What the hell is that?
jim Those are the doves.
