pam Well, it's not exactly a vacation.
angela Hello everyone! Remember little old me. Hi!
dwight What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin. family baby. Four days ago.
angela I wanted to come back to work. Not everybody needs some long luxurious Parisian maternity leave.
pam What?!
kelly Damn girl! Your body!
oscar Angela, you look amazing.
angela Really? I feel like this big rhinoceros. Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for covering for me so I made some treats. I've got brownies and magic cookie bars.
group 
pam Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?
kevin Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
pam Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.
angela I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
pam When did you find time to do all this?
angela Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
pam Thank you. Oh my gosh. It's really good.
angela I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
pam So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat. is cash. So-
jim Nope. It's over.
pam . we wanted to say thank you-
jim Nope. OK.
andy Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
dwight What?
andy I think you're going to like it.
dwight You can't tantalize me.
andy Oooh, maybe I can. I got an email. from corporate. . that told me that.
dwight OK.
andy That. you got a promotion! Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.
dwight If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
andy No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.
dwight Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
dwight The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life
perfectly Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, "perfect pork anus" which I don't mean.
erin And here's the fax for you.
andy And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.
erin Ah! Love to learn.
andy Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.
erin So.
andy Uh yeah, look at that.
erin We're pin twins.
andy Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.
erin Yeah. That's cute. When I saw it in CVS it made me gag too.
erin For a while there I thought something would change. But nope. Andy's still with Jessica, they even carpool together most days. I don't know, I wouldn't mind carpooling every day with Andy, but I wouldn't want to spend that much time with Jessica.
darryl What do we have here?
darryl val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a "we're just friends" beanie or a "I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
dwight Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
pam Really?
dwight Mm hm.
pam I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
jim Ooh, me three.
dwight Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
pam Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to andy about?
dwight God, you're such a spy.
darryl Notice anything different about me?
val You're wearing the beanie. You like it?
darryl Super comfortable. Like sweatpants for my head.
nate I love it too Val. It's it's really itchy, uh but to be fair my head is constantly itching so I can't really peg it on the hat.
darryl Wow. It's like the nation of Islam down here.
val I like to knit, don't hate. And who's that for?
darryl Oh, this is a gift, for. . my man nate here.
nate What?
darryl Yeah.
nate Darryl, you shouldn't have.
darryl Hey.
nate Can I open it?
darryl No, no, no. Maybe just later.
nate Ah, I can't wait. I'm sorry. I get too excited. Darryl.
val Wow. Those are really nice.
nate They're so elegant.
val Cashmere.
nate How'd you know?
darryl Just a hunch. Your gift is on the way.
val Can't wait.
nate "I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day. " Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
dwight My first task as special project manager dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or. What's your name?
kathy Kathy.
dwight Kathy.
jim I just got a text from Robert California that says "bring your clubs to Florida".
pam Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?
jim I hope not. Because I am not going. Two question marks?
pam No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.
andy You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, angela and Oscar?
dwight Yes.
andy Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a creed or a meredith perhaps?
dwight Oh my god.
andy They're not expendable exactly, I just can't. I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
dwight Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
andy Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. darryl and phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, kelly and Kevin.
dwight Oh god.
andy You have your team.
dwight Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
pam Well, let's hear it.
jim "Robert, Hey!" Exclamation point.
pam I like it so far.
jim "Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA" Dash JH.
pam It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.
jim Yeah, it's a golf text.
pam Total golf text. Send it.
jim Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
kelly You wanna call someone? That texted you!? Do you wanna drive them away? I mean, ugh.
darryl This is Darryl.
bob Oh, sorry I asked for the main shipping number. I just need the address for the warehouse? I want to send my girlfriend some flowers.
darryl Your girlfriend? Is your girlfriend Val?
bob Yeah, do you know her?
darryl We're friends. We're friends.
bob Cool. Um, so can I get that address or. ?
darryl Yeah sorry, I'm just looking for a pen.
bob Why do you need a pen?
darryl Back off! I got my reasons.
dwight May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, kevin and kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
kelly Why?
dwight Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
kelly Hell yeah.
stanley What?!
dwight Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, andy rejected you.
meredith Wait. kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? pam is back.
oscar It just feels like a slap in the face.
dwight I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
oscar We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
dwight I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
kevin Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
dwight Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
ryan What are the criteria for going?
dwight It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
andy Mooshie mooshie.
dwight Uh, the florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
andy Well uh. well the deliberations were confidential so. I feel like we should respect that.
stanley Respect it? You're trying to tell me kevin Malone deserves more than stanley Hudson.
kevin Hey!
angela Ok, it's obvious andy picked the people that are least important to the office.
kelly Important? Oh because you and your enormous monster baby are so important to the branch.
angela My baby is not a monster!
dwight Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
andy Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!
ryan Stop calling us "guys". . push;
andy I use the word "guys" a lot when I'm nervous. guys.
andy Guys! Guys! Guys!
group Stop it!
andy Guys.
ryan Stop. Stop it Andy.
oscar . Andy.
andy Dudes. the dudes who are going to florida were picked by dwight and me.
dwight OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
andy Wha-
stanley If anybody's going to Florida, it should be me. Every shirt I have that isn't a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama. I'm the only person in this office who watches Burn Notice.
andy OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
dwight Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to florida and andy and I will listen to it.
andy No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.
kelly For you maybe.
andy Five to six hours?
dwight Three to four hours.
andy No no no no.
dwight Two to three hours.
andy Nope.
dwight Come up with a statement in the next hour. .
andy Thirty minutes!
creed I'm out.
pam Ok, read it back to me.
jim Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
pam Good. Doesn't sound pushy. you're just stating a fact.
erin Absolutely. Works for me.
jim Ok, sending.
pam Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.
jim Really did He responded L-O-L.
erin 
phyllis I have a new swimsuit I need to break in. .
meredith I am.
dwight I have already picked my
team Darryl, Oscar, Angela, phyllis and toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.
ryan You have two young dynamic people in this office who know trends, who know youth. That's myself and kelly Kapoor, you need one of us there.
andy Or both?
ryan Not both. Just one, me. Or if not me, Kelly. Ideally me. Again, youth knowledge. That's what you get when you put ryan Howard on your special project team. or kelly Kapoor. Again, not both. Thanks.
andy Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
dwight Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. all show, no meat.
kevin Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something.
dwight Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
andy Thank you.
kevin When do we leave?
andy Thank you.
toby It has been a long, lonely winter.
dwight Wow. Seasonal effective disorder,
aka sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.
toby It is real, thank you for saying that.
andy Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?
stanley florida stanley smiles. florida stanley is happy to go to work. florida stanley is who you want on your florida team.
dwight Maybe it's what she does here.
andy Well.
erin Hey guys, any spots left?
andy Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?
erin I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
dwight You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
erin Either or. But if you can find someone to fill in, I would love to go.
andy Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in.
erin Really? Oh, great. Good, ahem, good.
jim Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?
pam I think you need to go to Florida.
jim I think you're right.
pam It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be.
jim Total nightmare.
pam I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?
jim Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
pam Exactly.
dwight Well, No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
andy Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
dwight I wouldn't say that. it's a bit much.
jim You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
dwight jim is essential to th-
jim Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.
dwight Andy, jim is just too. essen-.
jim Essential.
dwight This is stupid! Cut.
jim Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
dwight He doesn't even want to go.
jim Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
dwight Oh my god.
jim Hey, quick
question Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.
andy OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to
florida Kathy.
dwight What?
andy . . Stanley.
dwight No.
andy . Ryan.
dwight No!
andy . Erin.
dwight 
andy . And, Jim.
dwight You've gotta be -ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, florida group, welcome to the team. AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
dwight Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
stanley Why is it so hot in here?
dwight Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
ryan But.
dwight But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
ryan No no, I want to go.
dwight Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.
jim Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
dwight SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
dwight How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
stanley How did a mosquito get in here?
dwight I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes.
dwight Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, oh. What was that?
jim Mosquito.
dwight Orientation is over.
nate Oh Darryl, hey.
darryl Hey what's up? You called?
nate Yeah, you know I, I felt really terrible that you got me these lovely gloves and I didn't get you anything.
darryl It's cool really.
nate No, it's anything but cool. Now I haven't really had time to go out and buy you anything, but uh, here goes.
darryl "This coupon entitles you to one free tickle monster attack"
nate Yeah, they're nate coupons. Or Nate-pons. And they're all different. Cash that one in and I will bring you a stick of gum, anytime, any place. I'll find you.
darryl Thanks. Nice flowers.
val Thanks, they're from my mom.
darryl Your mom?
val Yeah.
darryl Uh. So I guess that was your mom who called me earlier looking for the address? Real deep voiced woman?
val Yeah, that's her.
darryl She said her name was Brandon, I think. Your mom's name is Brandon?
val Yeah Darryl, my mom's name is Brandon.
darryl Then I guess I figured out where I stand. This is a love beanie.
dwight Ok, florida team, let's reconvene.
erin I'm going to Florida. . and I'm not coming back.
dwight So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
jim So, what is this special project?
dwight Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
jim That sounds awesome.
dwight It did, it did.
ryan You know what might be great? Is if instead of a genius bar we have a lounge area where people can ask questions about the product with other customers who liked it.
erin Yeah. And they should have a place where people can check their computers or printers before they see you so you don't have to carry it around like a dope. Like a coat check. Oh, don't write it down unless you like it.
dwight Oh, I like it.
ryan It seems to me that the Apple store is kind of like a party. So I think our question
is How do we make this a better party?
dwight No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
ryan Right. Think different, from Apple.
jim Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
dwight Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
dwight I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
kelly I don't know how I'm going to live here without you.
ryan Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
kelly Yes, I will take your coat. And I will keep it with me, and I will sleep with it because it smells like you.
ryan No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
pam Alright
jim Bye.
pam Bye. Call me when you land.
jim I will.
andy Safe travels.
erin Goodbye for a very very long time.
andy Oh, K. It's only three weeks.
kathy all expenses paid. Yeah, Jim's gonna be there. Their marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me. Definitely we will. It's three weeks in Tallahassee, what else is there to do?
