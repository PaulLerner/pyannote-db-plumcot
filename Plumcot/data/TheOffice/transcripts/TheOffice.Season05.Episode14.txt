jim_halpert This morning the phone guy comes in, and he shows Michael that the phones have a PA function. And then he just left.
michael_scott This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration. I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me. Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
jim_halpert
michael_scott Could I stick it with a pin?
pam_beesly Ugh.
michael_scott Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
jim_halpert
michael_scott You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
jim_halpert That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert What the heck? Is that, uh...
michael_scott You find it?
jim_halpert I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
michael_scott All right.
jim_halpert All right.
michael_scott Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
michael_scott Hello, good morning.
pam_beesly Good morning.
michael_scott You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
michael_scott Well, Pam and I have eloped. Actually we just robbed a bank, and we are on the lam. No, uh, seriously, I am on a lecture circuit. Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. Oh that, well, that is Pam. Pam is coming along as my assistant and my driver so I can focus. And I like to pack heavy.
pam_beesly He brought a sled.
michael_scott No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
pam_beesly Yeah. I love being on the road, but I especially love the time and a half pay 24 hours a day, for three days. Cause I have a mortgage now, got a bring home the bucks.
michael_scott Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go! Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
pam_beesly Separate rooms.
michael_scott Well that goes without saying.
pam_beesly I'm going to say it anyway.
michael_scott Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's...
pam_beesly This is a new cardigan.
michael_scott ...kind of Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott No. Oh, all right.
jim_halpert Hey, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor Screw you.
dwight_schrute Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
kelly_kapoor Oh yeah? Screw you too.
jim_halpert Whoa! What was that all about.
phyllis_vance You forgot her birthday, it was yesterday.
jim_halpert Go ahead.
dwight_schrute Go ahead, you do it.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute I insist.
jim_halpert Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
dwight_schrute What he said was...
jim_halpert Just, easy.
dwight_schrute ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
jim_halpert Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
dwight_schrute I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. That's on my side.
jim_halpert So this is fun.
kelly_kapoor My birthday was yesterday, and everybody forgot. I got really dressed up and excited, and no one said a word. There wasn't even a party. I think sometimes people are really mean to the hot, popular girl.
pam_beesly Can I turn on the radio?
michael_scott No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
pam_beesly But then you fall asleep and there's nothing for me to do.
michael_scott Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
pam_beesly That's dangerous.
michael_scott Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
pam_beesly That's okay I can... I'm fine. I'll just play a song in my head.
michael_scott You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
pam_beesly No, that was a long time ago.
michael_scott Is that why your wearing makeup today?
pam_beesly No, I'm not even wearing that much.
pam_beesly I hate the idea that someone out there hates me. I even hate thinking that Al-Qaeda hates me. I think if they got to know me, they wouldn't hate me. But Karen knows me, and she still hates me, so...
julia Oh, this is a nice office.
stanley_hudson You don't have to lie. Through here.
andy_bernard Um Phyllis, who's that?
phyllis_vance She's out of your league Andy.
andy_bernard For your information, I have been with lots of beautiful women.
phyllis_vance Sexually?
andy_bernard This conversation is over.
andy_bernard I am single now. What we have here, is the ultimate smackdown between the Nard-Dog and crippling despair, loneliness, and depression. I intend to win.
jim_halpert We just wanted to say we are very sorry.
kelly_kapoor Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
dwight_schrute If you say screw you one more time...
kelly_kapoor Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
dwight_schrute Hey, HEY.
jim_halpert Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
kelly_kapoor I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
dwight_schrute Oh God.
jim_halpert Okay.
kelly_kapoor In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
dwight_schrute What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
kelly_kapoor Ice Cream.
pam_beesly Okay, uh, point at the Dunder Mifflin.
michael_scott Hello, Rolando, how are you?
rolando Hi.
michael_scott Rolando, I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
rolando Uh, your late, everyone's already in the conference room. Karen will be right here to take you over.
michael_scott Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.
pam_beesly Stop it, please.
michael_scott That's what I do, steal my trick.
pam_beesly Please cut it out.
karen_filippelli Hey. Hi, guys.
michael_scott Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
karen_filippelli What!
pam_beesly Michael!
karen_filippelli Of course not!
michael_scott Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had s*x, and...
karen_filippelli Let's just get this over with, shall we?
michael_scott Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
jim_halpert Are you kidding?
dwight_schrute Well, I'm not done yet.
jim_halpert Dwight. This, fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
dwight_schrute They match the carpet
jim_halpert What is that? It is your birthday period.
dwight_schrute It's a statement of fact.
jim_halpert Not even an exclamation point?
dwight_schrute This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
jim_halpert I can't believe how bad this looks.
dwight_schrute Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
jim_halpert Okay, good then.
dwight_schrute Have you collected the money from everyone?
jim_halpert I am working on it.
dwight_schrute How much do you have?
jim_halpert Six dollars.
dwight_schrute That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
jim_halpert I said I was working on it.
dwight_schrute
andy_bernard Trying to see what CD's she got. It's good to know the deets about the girl you're wooing. Eh, Aha! Fiest. Yes! Whoa! Aah, Aah!
michael_scott NO! Oh, my God. Oh, No. That is so awful. That is the worst news. I have to go. I have to do a presentation. I'll talk to you... This is going to be hard for me to speak today. Because I just learned that my father has died. ... No, he didn't! He is alive. And this isn't even a cell phone. This is a calculator. But you bought it! And now you can't return it. Or can you? No you can't. Yes. Karen, do you need to go pump?
karen_filippelli Not gonna have to do that, till after I have the baby. No, I am wondering. What are you talking about?
michael_scott I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
karen_filippelli But now we think you're a liar.
michael_scott Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?
michael_scott I am a theatrical person. Growing up, I always thought I would become an actor. Because I have, these memorization tricks that I use. Um, for instance, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance by setting it to the tune of Old MacDonald. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God. With a woof-woof here, and a woof-woof there. Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.
michael_scott I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. "M" your name is Mark.
mark Yes.
michael_scott Got it. It works.
karen_filippelli Uh, it's very insulting.
michael_scott But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
mark But we already know each other's names.
michael_scott Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
karen_filippelli Okay. All right everyone, meeting's over.
michael_scott Oh, I still have more.
karen_filippelli Can I please see you in my office, please?
michael_scott She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, let's go.
julia I can't accept these prices, Stanley. They just cut our budget.
andy_bernard Brought you guys some coffees. Stanley, I know you have adult onset diabetes. So I put Splenda in yours. Let's see. How many did I put in there? One, Two, Three, Four Splenda's in your coffee, Stanley. None in yours, Julia, cause I don't know how you take it. But if you'd rather...
stanley_hudson Four Splenda. Are you crazy?
andy_bernard Well, No, I actually only put in two. But that's not how the songs goes.
stanley_hudson Are you out of your damn mind?
andy_bernard Are you out of your damn mind? You bring an angel like that into this office, and you don't even set me up with her.
stanley_hudson We're not friends. I didn't think about it.
andy_bernard We are friends. Stanley, we're friends. And you let me down.
stanley_hudson You really like her, huh?
andy_bernard Yeah. I really like her with all my heart.
stanley_hudson Give me two clients for her.
michael_scott I grab this , and I turn it on and I say, "Prepare yourself, for the Utica chain store massacre."
karen_filippelli No that's, that is incredibly dangerous.
michael_scott No, don't worry, the chain is off.
pam_beesly No it's not.
karen_filippelli You know, I think I'm just gonna distill all this, and send it in an email to my team.
michael_scott Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
pam_beesly So when are you due?
karen_filippelli Uh, in about a month.
pam_beesly Wow, that is wonderful, congratulations.
karen_filippelli Thank you. It just all happened so fast.
michael_scott It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
karen_filippelli Yes, Michael. My husband impregnated me.
michael_scott Oh, great.
karen_filippelli His name is Dan, uh, this is us. So dorky.
pam_beesly Oh, he's cute.
karen_filippelli Yeah, he's so cute. He's a dermatologist. We met a bar. Can you believe that?
pam_beesly What is happening there?
karen_filippelli Oh, yeah. Don't even. That's really dorky.
pam_beesly It's really sweet.
michael_scott No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
karen_filippelli So, how are things in Scranton? How's Jim?
pam_beesly Uh, they're good. Uh, Jim's good. We're engaged.
karen_filippelli That's so great. That's great.
pam_beesly Thank you.
karen_filippelli Oh, my God. I'm so happy for you.
michael_scott Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
stanley_hudson I have to take care of a couple things. So Andy will be taking over things here. You're in good hands, and give my best to your mother.
andy_bernard So Julia, um, let's see. With regards to, uh, billing. Should we send bills to you, or to your boyfriend's house or?
julia No, it could go straight to our business address.
andy_bernard Oh Okay, all right. That makes sense. How does your boyfriend, deal with your phenomenal success? Is he just, like, totally threatened by you, or?
julia Actually, I, I don't have a boyfriend.
andy_bernard Really? Is that... wow, that's so weird.
andy_bernard Guys, stop everything. I'm about to ask out this girl, and I'm completely panicking.
oscar_martinez Oh, my desk is over...
creed_bratton This gal, she's really into you?
andy_bernard Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've seen her, like, three times today. And we love all the same music, and whenever I walk into a room, she totally looks up.
creed_bratton All right, all right. Say no more. So, this is how I got squeaky fromme. No small talk. Just show her who's the boss. Just go right in and kiss her.
andy_bernard Okay, it sounds risky.
creed_bratton Have I ever steered you wrong, Jim?
andy_bernard Wait, what?
michael_scott I would give that lecture a solid B+. Although, for the record, Karen. Wow, kind of mean.
pam_beesly I like her.
michael_scott Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
pam_beesly I'm serious. Um, I'm really glad I came.
michael_scott Why?
pam_beesly Because, um, cause I'll never wonder ever again. If I did something wrong and... Now I have closure. She's happy and, I don't know, it feels good.
julia Thanks for walking me out.
andy_bernard Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all kinds of weirdo's out here, so...
julia You must be freezing.
andy_bernard I am about to die. Will you wait here while I go get my jacket?
julia Oh, no, it's okay. This is my car.
andy_bernard Okay, Okay. Well listen, you're a new client, and as one of my new clients, you will always be taken care of. And that is the Nard-Dog guarantee.
julia What's a "Nard-Dog"?
andy_bernard This is the Nard-Dog.
julia Whoa. What the hell?
andy_bernard Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh I, I thought we had this energy. And I'm a mess. And I just had my heart broken. And you came in today and your so pretty. You're, like, incredibly pretty.
julia I just got out of a relationship too. It's really hard.
andy_bernard Yeah, right? Wow. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? Go to a mall of something? Just walk around?
julia No, I, I don't think so.
andy_bernard Sure, yeah that's... your right. It's too soon for... definitely too soon for me. So I'm glad we go that out of the way. I'm gonna be in touch with you. In three months. I'm gonna call you about that order. And maybe about that mall walk.
julia Okay.
andy_bernard Take care Julia.
julia Thank you.
andy_bernard Sorry I tried to kiss y...
andy_bernard We lost the account.
dwight_schrute Damn it! Dwight Schrute.
jim_halpert How old's Kelly?
dwight_schrute Who is this?
jim_halpert It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
dwight_schrute Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
jim_halpert Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
dwight_schrute Uh, 24. 37.
jim_halpert Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
dwight_schrute I'll call you back.
dwight_schrute I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..." Blah, Blah, Blah.
pam_beesly Are you asleep?
michael_scott No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
pam_beesly No, remind me.
michael_scott Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
pam_beesly Perfect boobs, of course I remember Holly.
michael_scott She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
pam_beesly Okay, lets go.
michael_scott I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
pam_beesly Yeah, screw 'em. Let's do this.
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert So I am collecting $3 from everybody. For Kelly's party.
creed_bratton I'd like to contribute.
jim_halpert Oh, great.
creed_bratton There you go.
jim_halpert
