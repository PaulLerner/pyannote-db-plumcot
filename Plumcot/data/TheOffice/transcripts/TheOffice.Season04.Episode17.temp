michael Hey. Ready? Come on, show me excited!
oscar Yes.
michael Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.
michael Today I'm heading over to the job fair at Valley View High School, to find some new interns. Want to get some fresh blood. Um, euthanize this place.
darryl Hey, are we doing this thing?
michael Yup.
kelly Oh my God, Darryl, you look like Barack Obama. Everybody I'm dating Barack Obama!
michael Why are you dressed like that?
darryl Like what?
michael Like you're applying for a loan.
dwight Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
darryl Figured I look presentable. You? Went a different way.
pam I think you look nice. michael and
darryl Thank you.
michael Okay, here's what we're going to
do I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. oscar will be in charge of accounting. pam will be eye candy. No. uh, also, because that is your alma mater. darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.
darryl What college did you go to Mike?
michael Let's go!
jim Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job. Since I have some pretty big long term plans in my personal life with Pam, that I'd like her parents to be psyched about. So I am about to do something very bold at this job that I've never done before. Try. phil
maguire Whoa!
jim Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years. phil
maguire Hey Jim, how are you, nice to see you man.
andy Oh no! No, no-no-no-no! My grandfather would be spinning in his urn, if he knew that I was out here with a Dartmouth boy. You take that shirt off right now or I will take it off for you, sir. I am. totally and completely kidding! Andrew Bernard, Cornell '95. phil
maguire phil Maguire, Dartmouth, '74
andy Oop, got some blisties. phil
maguire Yeah, you do.
andy Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.
phil Let's make it interesting, say, uh, ten bucks a hole?
jim Great!
kevin What are we talking? Skins? Acey Duecy? Bingo bango bongo? Sandies, Barkies? Arnies, Wolf? What?
kevin I'm gonna take this petty cash I got from Oscar, and turn it into next month's rent.
pam So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!
michael A little over the top, don't you think?
darryl Show them what you brought, Mike.
pam Um, that's all we brought.
michael This is all we need.
oscar We'll see.
michael Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business! Hello!
kevin Andy, you're up, let's go!
andy Giddy up, let's do this.
andy People assume I'm great at golf. But like everybody, I hated golf lessons when I was a kid. So, I used to hang out at the sailing club instead. Got my "knot" on.
andy Dammit!
meredith Guys, do we have to stay all day?
phyllis I mean, Michael's gone, can't we just go?
creed Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
dwight Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When michael is gone. jim is in charge. When jim is gone, andy and I are in charge. When andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
phyllis What consequences?
dwight I will tell on you.
pam There's some filing, restocking the supply shelves. Replacing the water jug, which nobody likes to do. Um, we. uh, eat a lot of cake!
justin Cool.
pam Yeah, and uh, you basically learn how an office runs.
michael Hello. Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
pam This is Michael, my boss. Justin.
michael Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest. "
pam He's nice and he seems interested.
michael He's totally wrong, Pam. Hey.
justin Hi.
michael How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a. migraine worker. Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
justin Sorry for wasting your time.
michael Oh, no problem. And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
darryl Yeah, the booth is lame without it.
pam I only brought the one.
michael Are you mental?
pam Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, "Are you sure Michael?" And you said "Pam! Pam! Pam!" And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, "Don't worry, it's just allergies. " Do you remember that?
michael I. don't.
pam Okay. I'll go look for another one.
michael And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
jim Hey, so how's the direct mail business going?
phil I can't complain, people love their junk mail.
jim Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
phil You know what Jim? I'm not really looking to change things up right now, I just came out here to get out of the office for a little bit, so why don't we just play, okay?
jim Absolutely, will do.
jim So I guess I'll just. work on my short game.
michael Hello there.
kid What is this company?
michael Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company.
oscar Dunder Mifflin paper.
kid Thanks.
michael Dammit, Oscar!
michael Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline!
dwight Thank you.
angela Extension 128.
creed Hiya Pumpkin, it's Creed.
creed Say, we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?
angela No.
creed Are you out? Pumpkin's out, let's go gang!
pam My old art room. Oh, maybe it's still here! No. No they must have taken it down. Never mind.
michael What do you want?
dwight Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
michael Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
dwight So. what else is up? Mich- . push;
michael Thank you! What, what is this?
pam A piece of paper.
michael This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
pam Well I think they'll get the spirit of it.
michael Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
pam Are you serious?
michael Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
pam Okay.
phil Oh! Ah, dammit!
jim You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
phil Yeah I'll- I'll get it out. Thank you.
jim Yep. angela and
dwight 
andy AH! Come on, Tuna!
jim Hey, can't really talk now, what's up?
pam Just checking in, how's it going?
jim Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
pam I just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get michael a single sheet of white paper. So, I could have just had them fax it to me, I guess.
jim Oh, I like you.
pam Talk to you later?
jim Yeah. All right. Bye. All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
phil You can try. But I've looked at your prices. Even with free shipping? Doesn't work. It's just- it's not in the stars, Jim. Six.
kevin Yeah.
andy All right, race to the next hole!
kevin Ooh! Winner gets ten bucks! Wait -wait for me! Andy!
andy Shortcut! Shortcut! Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
dwight 
michael All of these jobs? Suck. I would rather live jobless, on a beach somewhere, off the money from a large inheritance, than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes. They suck.
michael Hey! Game over.
michael Just-in time.
justin Hi.
michael Just-in case. What's your last name?
justin Polznik.
michael This. just in. justin Polznik! Huh?
michael justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who takes off her glasses and she's hot! And you realize she was always hot, she was just wearing glasses. And that you were the blind one. He's the most. important thing in my life right now.
michael I want you to meet my family. Come on. oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.
oscar Hey.
justin Hi.
michael This is darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you. No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
pam Excuse me.
michael Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
oscar Why, why wouldn't you say that to her face?
michael So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
justin You didn't want me before. That's what you said.
michael No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
justin You were kind of a jerk to me.
michael I, uh, hmm.
justin And I'm, I'm gonna go now.
michael Why don't. hey.
andy 
dwight Ah-choo!
angela Bless you.
dwight Thank you.
kevin Okay, Jim, you owe me one-twenty, and Phil, you owe me two-thirty.
phil Let's open a tab, because you and me are gonna be playing more often.
andy Count me in!
phil No.
andy All right!
jim Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
phil I'll tell you what. My fiscal year ends in two months, let's talk then. Sound good?
jim Absolutely.
maguire Good playing with you guys.
andy Right on.
jim You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after . fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good. Woman on
mic The job fair will be closing in five minutes. Eighth period will commence as scheduled.
michael Hold down the fort, I have to do something. Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&amp;R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn. it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
angela Thank you.
dwight You're welcome.
pam Beers? You closed it?
jim I closed it!
pam Yes! Oh! Um, congratulations to you, sir.
jim Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
pam Well done.
jim Thank you. You know what, screw this!
kevin Oooh!
michael Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.
michael Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good.
pam Hi. Graphics
guy Hello.
pam I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have? Graphics
guy Are you interested in graphic design?
pam Yeah. Can I fill out an application? Graphics
guy Oh absolutely, here, take a seat. I should let you know right away, this is just an entry-level job. It's really basic. We're looking for like, a self starter, someone who can meet deadlines, who just pretty much just go the extra mile, I guess.
pam I can do that. Graphics
guy Great. And uh, obviously looking for someone who knows Photoshop, and Dreamweaver. Uh, Corel Painter, Illustrator, AfterEffects, all the basics.
pam I don't know any of those. Graphics
guy It's actually not super-complicated. I mean I'm sure there's some sort of like, adult education classes in the area. But if you're really serious about graphic design, one thing about New York or Philadelphia, they've got amazing programs out there for design.
pam New York or Philadelphia. Graphics
guy Yeah.
pam All right. Cool, well. thanks. Graphics
guy Sure.
pam And uh, I'll look into those. Graphics
guy You should.
pam New York or Philadelphia. Graphics
guy Absolutely.
pam Okay. Graphics
guy It's where the action is.
pam Thanks.
