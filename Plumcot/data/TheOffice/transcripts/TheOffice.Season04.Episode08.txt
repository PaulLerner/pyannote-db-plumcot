oscar_martinez So the figures show improvement right there, Michael. And again-
michael_scott I'll call back.
kevin_malone You never call back.
pam_beesly Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.
michael_scott Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.
jan_levinson
michael_scott You can't always work 200 days though.
michael_scott Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting.
ryan_howard You have to know how to work this. There's no excuse for this.
michael_scott Yep.
ryan_howard I can get you a tutor if you need-
michael_scott Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
ryan_howard Oh, no, no, no, customer service is obviously priority one. You can take the call.
michael_scott N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
ryan_howard Take the call, friend.
michael_scott I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
ryan_howard I insist you take your work calls.
michael_scott Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? Hi buddy.
jan_levinson I don't know, it's just, ugh, I never felt welcomed there, you know? It's such a...boys club.
michael_scott Yeah, I hate that.
jan_levinson Good.
michael_scott So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
jan_levinson And they displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
michael_scott Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
jan_levinson Um, no, I want it up. My hair.
michael_scott Well-
jan_levinson Remember, it isn't just a pattern, It's a pattern of disrespect, and inappropriate behavior.
michael_scott Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
jan_levinson Does this work for you?
michael_scott Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
jan_levinson Uh, come on Micheal, that's tacky.
michael_scott Million dollars!
jan_levinson Four million.
michael_scott Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
jan_levinson No, Michael. Oh, come on.
michael_scott Perfect crime.
jan_levinson Stop saying ridiculous things. He's just gonna tell the truth, the truth is-is very...you know, complicated, so we went over it carefully, and-and just so we wouldn't leave anything up to chance or Michael's judgment.
michael_scott Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
jan_levinson Michael, I told you, I am not putting the top down.
michael_scott I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
jan_levinson All right, fine, just a second. Hold on.
michael_scott Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?
lester_snyder A good start. And I think it's busload.
michael_scott Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
ryan_howard Hey Michael.
michael_scott Hey hey.
ryan_howard I'm glad you're here. I actually need to talk to you for a second.
ryan_howard Could we talk off the record? As friends?
michael_scott I would love that.
ryan_howard Jan... has put the company in a very tough position here. Now you've been with us for a long time. Over 10 years, right? We just want to be sure that you won't do anything to hurt us with your testimony. Do you understand?
michael_scott Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
ryan_howard Good. That is great to hear.
michael_scott It is.
darryl_philbin Game, son!
jim_halpert All right, let's run it back.
pam_beesly The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.
kelly_kapoor What has two skinny chicken legs and sucks at ping pong?
pam_beesly Hi, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor Guess whose boyfriend it is?
pam_beesly I don't wanna guess.
kelly_kapoor I'll give you a hint It's not my boyfriend. I think it's a guy over here .
kelly_kapoor I don't talk trash, I talk smack. They're totally different. Trash talk is hypothetical, like Your mom is so fat she can eat the internet. But smack talk is happening like right now. Like You're ugly and I know it for a fact so I got the evidence right there.
pam_beesly Jim. Can I see you for a second?
jim_halpert Sure.
jim_halpert Wow.
pam_beesly Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.
jim_halpert Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
pam_beesly Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.
jim_halpert What, seriously? What is she saying?
kelly_kapoor Your boyfriend is so weak, he needs steroids just to watch baseball.
kelly_kapoor Jim couldn't hit a ping pong ball if it was the size of the moon.
kelly_kapoor Were Jim's parents first cousins that were also bad at ping pong?
jim_halpert So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?
pam_beesly Sorta, yes.
jim_halpert Bring me players.
pam_beesly Okay.
diane_kelly Kelly Hi everyone, I'm Diane Kelly. I'm the company's chief legal counsel.
michael_scott Hi. No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
diane_kelly Toby?
michael_scott Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
toby_flenderson Michael, I'm your HR Rep. I'm on your side.
michael_scott Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
jan_levinson Michael, just relax, okay?
diane_kelly You know, I think they're, uh ready for us now. So..
michael_scott Okay. All right.
Deposition#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode08 Reporter Mr. Scott. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
michael_scott Yessh.
lester_snyder Mr. Scott, can you describe the circumstances of Ms. Levinson's termination?
michael_scott Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
lester_snyder Oh. Very good. Well put.
jan_levinson People underestimate Michael. There are plenty of things that he is well above average at. Like ice skating. He is a very good ice skater.
pam_beesly Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.
kevin_malone About what?
pam_beesly He needs help balancing some travel receipts.
kevin_malone Are you sure he wants me? Because I have Oscar balance my travel receipts.
pam_beesly Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.
kevin_malone Oh, awesome!
lester_snyder How long have you known the plaintiff?
michael_scott I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
lester_snyder How long have you known Ms. Levinson?
michael_scott Six years and two months.
lester_snyder And you were directly under her the entire time?
michael_scott That's what she said.
lester_snyder Excuse me?
michael_scott That's what she said.
lester_snyder Ms. Levinson told you she was your direct superior?
michael_scott Uh, wh-why would she say that?
jan_levinson Can we just move on to another question?
diane_kelly No wait, I don't understand. Who's on record on saying this?
lester_snyder With all due respect, I'm in the middle of a line of questioning. Now Mr. Scott, what did you say Ms. Levinson said? Regarding your employment status with respect to her corporate position.
michael_scott Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
jan_levinson Okay, if I may, he was just telling a joke before, so can we move on to another question?
lester_snyder Oh, are you sure?
jan_levinson Uh, yes.
lester_snyder Can you go back to where this digression began?
Deposition#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode08 Reporter Mr. Schneider And you were directly under her the entire time? Mr. Scott That's what she said.
michael_scott Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, that's what I thought.
lester_snyder Did Ms. Levinson ever say why she thought she was being fired?
michael_scott She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
lester_snyder Can you be more specific? Who are the twins?
michael_scott Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.
lester_snyder You don't need to go any further. Her breasts.
michael_scott Yes.
lester_snyder She thought it had something to do with her recent breast enhancement surgery?
michael_scott Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
lester_snyder What about your romantic relationship with Ms. Levinson? Could that have played a part in her termination?
michael_scott Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
lester_snyder Interesting. How so?
michael_scott Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here.
diane_kelly Okay, the company has just a few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott, if that's okay with you?
michael_scott I will allow it.
diane_kelly Um would you mind please just, uh, taking a quick look at, uh, this photograph please.
michael_scott Uh...
diane_kelly That is you and Ms. Levinson in Jamaica, is that correct?
michael_scott Uh-huh.
diane_kelly And that photograph was taken more than two months prior to this start of your relationship. Does that sound right? Mr. Scott, the timeline here is actually very important. Please, when did your relationship actually begin?
michael_scott Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
diane_kelly Wait, excuse me?
michael_scott If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
lester_snyder Could we take a short break?
diane_kelly No, uh, are you telling me that your relationship began two years ago and not in February as you previously testified to here?
michael_scott Line.
diane_kelly I'm sorry, what?
stanley_hudson He asked for a line, like in a play.
Deposition#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode08 Reporter "Mr. Scott, do you realize you just contradicted yourself?" "I did?" "Yes you did." "Can I go to the bathroom?" "No." "I really have to, I've been drinking lots of water." "You went five minutes ago." "That wasn't to go to the bathroom, that was to get out of a question." "You still have to answer it." "First can I go to the bathroom?" "No."
jim_halpert Good game Meredith.
meredith_palmer Don't patronize me.
dwight_schrute All right! What is going on here?
jim_halpert Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
jim_halpert What the hell?
dwight_schrute I told you.
dwight_schrute All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, Jörg Roßkopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
michael_scott Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.
diane_kelly Kelly Thank you, Mr. Scott. That's all we needed to know.
lester_snyder Wait, we'd like to enter to the record a page from Michael Scott's personal journal.
michael_scott Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
lester_snyder This is plaintiff's exhibit 107. I quote from an entry dated Janruary 4 of this past year. "Just got back from Jamaica. Tan almost everywhere. Jan almost everywhere. Hehe. Oh diary, what a week. I had s*x with my boss. I don't know if it's going to go anywhere. Jan was very specific that this is not going anywhere, that it was a one time mistake. But we had s*x six times so you tell me. I am definitely feeling very eerie."
michael_scott Irie.
lester_snyder Irie, sorry. "More tomorrow. xoxo, Michael." It would appear, that neither you nor Ms. Levinson considered you had a relationship in any sense of the word. Is that correct?
diane_kelly Kelly We're gonna need to see a copy of that entire journal before we proceed.
michael_scott I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
diane_kelly Kelly It's basic discovery. We have the right to review it.
stanley_hudson OK, let's make ten copies of this diary.
toby_flenderson Um, can you make it eleven?
stanley_hudson Eleven, sure. And we'll break for lunch, so everyone can have a look.
michael_scott Can I sit here?
toby_flenderson ...You know, I, uh, I know a little about what you're going through in a way. Um, when I was a kid, my parents got divorced. They both wanted custody, and they both asked me to testify against the other one in court. So, I don't know, I didn't want them getting divorced in the first place you know? I loved them both so much. I just wanted...
michael_scott How can you give up my diary like that?
jan_levinson I had to, I'm sorry but I need to win this. We need to win this.
michael_scott How'd you even find it?
jan_levinson You keep it under my side of the mattress.
michael_scott I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
jan_levinson Alright, I stole your diary and gave it to my lawyer. You emailed a topless photo of me to everyone in our company. Let's call it even.
michael_scott Fine. I love you.
jan_levinson I love you too.
diane_kelly Kelly Mr. Scott, who is this other woman, Ryan? Who you refer to her as "Just as hot as Jan, but in a different way."
michael_scott Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
lester_snyder Aren't we trying to determine whether Michael or Jan were engaged in a romantic affair? Not Michael and this Ryan person.
toby_flenderson Excuse me.
michael_scott Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had s*x with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
diane_kelly Kelly OK Mr. Scott, it's, it's admirable the way you defend a woman who is so obviously ambivalent about her relationship with you.
michael_scott Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
diane_kelly Kelly Considering she consistently gave you such poor performance reviews.
michael_scott That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... ...of water.
diane_kelly Kelly Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a particularly negative performance review. Would you mind, uh, reading the date on that please?
michael_scott March 17th.
diane_kelly Kelly And that would be a month after your relationship became official, is that correct?
michael_scott Yes.
diane_kelly Kelly You may read the, uh, highlighted portion out loud if you'd like to.
michael_scott "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."
diane_kelly Kelly Mr. Scott, after hearing that wouldn't you say Ms. Levinson's judgment is, at least, very seriously flawed?
michael_scott
diane_kelly Kelly Mr. Scott?
pam_beesly How's it going?
dwight_schrute Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
jim_halpert Check this out though, spin serve. Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
pam_beesly Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?
jim_halpert I think I'm ready.
pam_beesly I'll make the call.
dwight_schrute Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
jim_halpert ...Right. Spin-serve!
michael_scott How can you do that to me?
jan_levinson
lester_snyder You can respond, just remember it's all going into the record.
jan_levinson Michael, I am not the enemy, OK? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.
michael_scott Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
jan_levinson Alright, wait. Before you go any further, let me show you what kind of loyalty they have, OK? Lester, please read that part of Wallace's deposition.
lester_snyder Starting at paragraph 6. Council "Mr. Wallace, regarding Michael Scott, was he a contender to replace Jan Levinson?" David Wallace "Yes."
michael_scott See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
lester_snyder Council "Was he your first choice?" David Wallace "Michael Scott is a fine employee who has been with the company for many years."
Council#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode08 "Was he in the top 5 of contenders?" David Wallace "What do you want me to say? Come on, he's a nice guy. There were many people that I considered." Council "Was he seriously being considered for the corporate job?" David Wallace "No."
lester_snyder I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?
michael_scott ...Absolutely not.
pam_beesly Yes! Way to go. See that?
kelly_kapoor Yeah, the floppy haired girl you date won a point.
darryl_philbin 19, serving 4.
kelly_kapoor Woooh! Nice baby! Nice one! Hey, hey, you, you! I don't like your boyfriend! Cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz, cuz he sucks at ping-pong!
pam_beesly You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!
kelly_kapoor What?
pam_beesly Let's go. Pick up a paddle.
kelly_kapoor OK. Bring it on.
pam_beesly I am.
kelly_kapoor Think you can handle this?
pam_beesly In my sleep.
kelly_kapoor OK. Volley for serve, P.
pam_beesly O. P.
kelly_kapoor O.
jim_halpert Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
darryl_philbin Yes.
david_wallace Michael. I am very sorry.
michael_scott Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
david_wallace Wallace No, no, no, no, no. This was rough. We never meant for you to get caught in the middle of this. I'm very sorry.
michael_scott Hey, David?
david_wallace Yeah?
michael_scott I think you're a nice guy too.
david_wallace Thanks, Michael.
michael_scott Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.
michael_scott What do you want to do for dinner?
jan_levinson How about Chinese?
michael_scott Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
jan_levinson That was my cheap suggestion. Chinese was my cheap suggestion.
michael_scott Do you fast food?
jan_levinson Fine, fast food's fine.
