oscar No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
pam Oh.
pam Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
dwight People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3. 2. 1.
jim Oh, yikes.
pam It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
dwight It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
pam The signs will drive people inside.
dwight The warmth will lure people inside.
andy Close it.
dwight This is how business.
andy Close it.
dwight I'm not closing the door.
andy Close it.
dwight Stop it.
andy Just close it.
dwight Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
meredith Sure.
dwight Not so fast.
dwight Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
dwight I will trade you for the used candle.
meredith Forget you.
dwight Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
meredith Fine, just give it.

kelly Screw you man. People like my stuff.
dwight People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast. '
kelly You can take my Helen Fielding collection.

' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' . pesto party? Really? Anyway. she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis. just had that mom look I wanted.

dwight Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
dwight things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
dwight Jim, put those away.
jim I'm really sorry. pam must have put those out.
dwight just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?

pam Michael, she's perfect for you.
oscar She's the one.
jim She's amazing. This is very exciting.
pam So we just. we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
michael I had a great idea until you ruined it.
oscar Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself. . push;
andy Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
kevin Nice.
andy And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
kevin No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
andy Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
darryl And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
andy Oooh.
darryl Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
kevin no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
darryl It was in the box.
andy Well played.
darryl Thank you.
andy We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
kevin No but that's not fair.
andy Well that's Dallas.
darryl Dallas indeed.
oscar What. Ryan, where did you get this picture?
ryan My mom also makes the best salsa.
holly This is your moms old stuff?
phyllis Yeah mostly.
holly How's she doing?
phyllis It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
holly How do you know when its time?
phyllis Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
holly Let me see.
pam Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
ryan Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
michael How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you. '
jim That's a guarantee.
michael It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
jim Don't think you need the corpse then.
michael Heres the ring.
pam Holy s*** is that real?
michael Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
oscar No.
michael Is she not going to like that?
pam No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
oscar Where was that.
jim At a gas station.
michael At a gas station?
jim Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
michael That mush have been a surprise when. at the gas station you proposed.
pam No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and.
michael Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
jim Totally reasonable.
michael I just. it's terrifying.
pam She's not gonna say no.
michael I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
jim Cause it's a big deal. I mean. I knew pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
pam You were scared?
jim Yeah. it. s scary.
michael Get this. kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie. '
holly Look I need to talk to you.
michael Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
holly I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
michael Oh ok. For how long?
holly I don't know.
michael Is he alright?
holly Yeah.
michael You ok?
holly Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
michael Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
holly And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend.
michael Ok.
holly And I was thinking. you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready. michael Scott will you.
michael No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
holly Uh, what?
michael No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
kevin Hey guys it's my turn.
andy You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
kevin Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
darryl I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
kevin This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
darryl Yeah where is it?
kevin Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
kevin And that is Dallas.
ryan Nice.
jim Not bad right.
ryan Can't really tell the.
jim Nice.
dwight I know right. what the?
jim Oh my God.
dwight That. that's impossible.
jim It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
dwight All right, I'll take them.
jim They're probably worthless.
dwight Probably.
jim Leave the telescope.
dwight I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this. packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
michael Hey, how'd we do?
holly 13 dollars.
michael That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
holly Listen about earlier .
michael No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
holly It was wrong to put you in that position and. michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
michael Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
michael So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
holly Why?
michael This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
michael This is where we first kissed.
holly I remember.
michael And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
holly Michael.
michael Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
holly Yes.
michael In-grown hair.
michael Right in here. this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
holly Mh hmm.
michael We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met michael Klump.
holly Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
michael And right over there is where you found out that meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
michael And over here.
holly What happened here?
michael Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do.
holly Nice
michael Let's go in here.
holly Hi guys.
michael This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
jim Holly, will you marry me?
holly No.
stanley Marry me Holly.

holly No.
michael Easy no.
angela Will you marry me?
holly No.
michael That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
