oscar_martinez ...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good.
jim_halpert Yeah, that's right.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
michael_scott Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.
pam_beesly Michael, what's wrong?
michael_scott I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!
pam_beesly Ok, wait wait wait wait...
michael_scott Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
pam_beesly Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
michael_scott No, I want you to pick me up.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Ok...
jim_halpert What's going on?
pam_beesly Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
michael_scott I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
jim_halpert I'm sorry? Pam.
pam_beesly
jim_halpert What is going on?
michael_scott I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up.
michael_scott OH GOD!
jim_halpert Hey, whoa, Michael...
michael_scott Oh God!
jim_halpert It's, okay, it's Jim. Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
michael_scott OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
jim_halpert You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?
michael_scott I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.
michael_scott Pam, could you come get me?!
pam_beesly Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.
michael_scott Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
phyllis_vance Michael, you should stay home and rest.
michael_scott There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?
kevin_malone Can you hop?
michael_scott I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
michael_scott No one wants to pick me up!?
dwight_schrute What is going on? What is going on?
pam_beesly Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.
michael_scott I'm not sick! I'm burned!
dwight_schrute I'm coming Michael!
jim_halpert Oh...
dwight_schrute I'm gonna save you!
michael_scott Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
michael_scott I don't want Dwight!
pam_beesly Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?
michael_scott I don't have a girlfriend.
jim_halpert But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
michael_scott It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.
jim_halpert What was that...
pam_beesly What was that?!
jim_halpert Oh!
pam_beesly Ohhhhhh!
jim_halpert He hit the pole!
jim_halpert It's broken right, he can't...
pam_beesly Oh my gosh.
jim_halpert Oh Dwight, Dwight, Ohhhhhh!
jim_halpert and Pam Oh my God!
pam_beesly Is he ok?
jim_halpert He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
michael_scott Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
michael_scott Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.
pam_beesly You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.
michael_scott Did you explain why?
pam_beesly No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
michael_scott Burned my foot, Pam.
michael_scott Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.
jim_halpert So, where are you shipping your foot?
michael_scott Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...
dwight_schrute Your foot?
michael_scott Thank you. Pam, messages please?
pam_beesly You didn't have any.
michael_scott Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
pam_beesly And do my job?
michael_scott No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!
dwight_schrute It slipped.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute Sorry.
pam_beesly It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.
michael_scott I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.
pam_beesly Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.
michael_scott No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
dwight_schrute Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
michael_scott What? Part of your duties are to what?
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott You just said "part of your duties are to" something.
dwight_schrute No, I didn't.
michael_scott Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?
dwight_schrute What is wrong with you?
michael_scott Where is my cornbread?
ryan_howard Here you go.
michael_scott Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?
ryan_howard Yes. I ordered three full rotisserie chickens worth of all dark meat.
michael_scott Where are the yams?
ryan_howard They were out of yams. I got you creamed spinach.
michael_scott Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
ryan_howard Yes.
michael_scott And they had no yams?
ryan_howard They had no yams.
michael_scott How strange. Because they always have yams.
dwight_schrute Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
pam_beesly You've seen one of these?
dwight_schrute Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
pam_beesly Roy gave it to me for Christmas. I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.
dwight_schrute Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
pam_beesly Really?
dwight_schrute Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
pam_beesly Oh! Ha, haha.
dwight_schrute Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan.
pam_beesly Pan?
michael_scott Pam... PAAAM!?
pam_beesly Oh, God.
pam_beesly What.
michael_scott Come here please.
pam_beesly Tell me before I come there.
michael_scott I want you to rub butter on my foot.
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott Pam, please? I have Country Crock.
pam_beesly No.
michael_scott Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
dwight_schrute These covers are totally indestructible.
pam_beesly Really?
dwight_schrute Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it.
dwight_schrute Oh no, it's broken.
pam_beesly What?!
dwight_schrute No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long.
pam_beesly That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!
dwight_schrute Yep.
jim_halpert So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.
pam_beesly Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God! Dwight's kind of my friend!
michael_scott No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?
dwight_schrute Huh. Do you like candy?
angela_martin It's alright.
dwight_schrute Cause you're sweeter than candy.
angela_martin What is wrong with you?
angela_martin Hey!
toby_flenderson Wow, you just dive right into it.
ryan_howard You know, around age twelve, I just started goin' for it.
michael_scott No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
toby_flenderson What, what happened?
michael_scott I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
toby_flenderson What do you need?
michael_scott Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam.
toby_flenderson I don't think Pam's gonna want to come into the men's room.
michael_scott Get Ryan. He needs to lift me. and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.
toby_flenderson Ryan, is, uh, dead.
michael_scott No, he's not.
toby_flenderson Dead.
michael_scott I just saw him.
toby_flenderson No. Can't, can't you just get up yourself? I... You only grilled your foot.
michael_scott Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!
jim_halpert Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?
pam_beesly No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.
jim_halpert And that isn't weird?
pam_beesly Wow...
michael_scott Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?
phyllis_vance Um, I had scoliosis as a girl.
michael_scott No, never heard of it. No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble.
creed_bratton When I was a teenager, I was in an iron lung.
michael_scott Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
stanley_hudson I'm not disabled and neither are you.
michael_scott Ok, what does this look like to you Stanley?!
stanley_hudson Mailboxes, Etc.
michael_scott Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
phyllis_vance Oh, we wouldn't. We love Stevie Wonder.
michael_scott I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
dwight_schrute Dad?
michael_scott While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.
jim_halpert Quick question uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?
ryan_howard Twice.
michael_scott Good question. Forrest Gump mentally challenged, Philadelphia AIDS.
kevin_malone I think that's from Big.
michael_scott I don't think so, no.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, he's dancing on a piano with Robert Loggia.
michael_scott He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works. A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
stanley_hudson Uh hmmmm... .
michael_scott What you mean uh hmmm... ?
stanley_hudson I mean I'm learning nothing.
michael_scott Ok.
billy_merchant Merchant Michael Scott, I'm looking for Michael Scott.
michael_scott Yes, right in here, come on in.
billy_merchant Merchant Great.
michael_scott This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
billy_merchant Merchant Sorry I'm late. Someone parked in the handicapped parking space.
billy_merchant Merchant Hey everyone, I'm Billy Merchant, you may have seen me around here before, I'm the properties manager of this office park
michael_scott You are so brave. You are so brave.
billy_merchant Merchant Thank you. Actually, I've been meaning to come by here for a long time...
michael_scott But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
billy_merchant Merchant No, I just have a lot of properties to manage.
michael_scott Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
billy_merchant Merchant I don't know, like 30 seconds?
michael_scott Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
michael_scott How did you get in your wheelchair?
billy_merchant Merchant This morning? Just like every other morning, just climbed on in.
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
billy_merchant Merchant Hey, hey, relax, just jokin around here.
michael_scott Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.
billy_merchant Merchant Listen, I've actually used a chair since I was four years old. I don't really notice it anymore.
michael_scott Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
jim_halpert I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.
billy_merchant Merchant So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of...
michael_scott Ok...
billy_merchant Merchant First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions? Yes. Yeah? yes...
pam_beesly Dwight, you have your hand up.
michael_scott Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
billy_merchant Merchant You know what Michael?
michael_scott Yeah...
billy_merchant Merchant Let me stop you right there.
michael_scott Ok.
billy_merchant Merchant And leave.
michael_scott Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.
billy_merchant Merchant What's wrong with that guy?
jim_halpert You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.
billy_merchant Merchant No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion.
michael_scott Hey!
ryan_howard I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!
michael_scott You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.
ryan_howard You are very welcome.
michael_scott Did you get the yams?
ryan_howard No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!
michael_scott Ok, I'll just have the pudding.
ryan_howard You sure?
michael_scott Yeh.
ryan_howard Ok.
michael_scott You know what? I feel better. Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.
michael_scott Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.
ryan_howard I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.
michael_scott Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
dwight_schrute Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
jim_halpert Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.
michael_scott Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
angela_martin He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him.
michael_scott Why don't you go with him?
angela_martin I, barely know him...
dwight_schrute I want Michael to take me...
michael_scott I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
meredith_palmer You can take my van!
michael_scott Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive.
jim_halpert Fine.
michael_scott We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
jim_halpert Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator.
dwight_schrute Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
jim_halpert What are you doing? What, stop...
dwight_schrute Vietnam sounds.
jim_halpert Stop, stop, stop, stop.
dwight_schrute Tired...
jim_halpert You can't lay down.
dwight_schrute Want to take a rake... .
jim_halpert Wake up.
dwight_schrute Ahh!
pam_beesly Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.
jim_halpert I'm just gonna get...
dwight_schrute Ok, Pam, thanks.
pam_beesly Get up, get up.
dwight_schrute You're the best.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Just keep him awake.
dwight_schrute It smells like chicken soup.
pam_beesly I know.
dwight_schrute I have to go to the hospital.
pam_beesly I know.
dwight_schrute Where we going?
pam_beesly I just want to say goodbye ok?
dwight_schrute I'll be back, I mean...
pam_beesly Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.
dwight_schrute Why?
pam_beesly It's just hard to explain.
dwight_schrute Aw, Pam, you're adorable
pam_beesly Oh my goodness!
dwight_schrute
pam_beesly Come here.
dwight_schrute Oh, huggy hugs.
michael_scott Shotgun!
jim_halpert You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
michael_scott The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout "shotgun" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.
michael_scott Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?
jim_halpert Well, I think she has a kid.
michael_scott Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
dwight_schrute Where are we going?
jim_halpert Come on, get inside.
dwight_schrute Where are we going?
jim_halpert We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
michael_scott Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
jim_halpert We're going to the hospital, Michael.
michael_scott I know, just sayin'.
michael_scott Dwight, what are you drinking?
dwight_schrute I found it under the seat.
jim_halpert Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
dwight_schrute I'm thirsty.
jim_halpert Give the bottle to Michael
dwight_schrute No!
jim_halpert Give the bottle to Michael!
dwight_schrute I'm thirsty!
michael_scott Give it to me.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott Dwight... You just keep your eyes on the road. Give me the bottle or you're fired.
dwight_schrute You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
michael_scott Give it to me Dwight.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott Give me the bottle!!
jim_halpert Will you stop?
michael_scott Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
jim_halpert Michael stop.
dwight_schrute Mmmmm...
michael_scott Just give it!
jim_halpert Michael stop.
michael_scott Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! Gimme the bottle!
jim_halpert Stop
dwight_schrute My eyes!
michael_scott Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!
dwight_schrute My eyes!
michael_scott Dwight, what is your middle name.
dwight_schrute Danger.
michael_scott Something with a "K".
jim_halpert It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
michael_scott What do I write under "reason for visit"?
jim_halpert Concussion. What did you write?
michael_scott Nothing. I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".
jim_halpert So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
michael_scott No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him.
jim_halpert Come on Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hi Michael!
michael_scott Hi Dwight.
dwight_schrute Ahhh. Mweehaa
michael_scott Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
the_doctor A head injury.
michael_scott Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
the_doctor So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.
dwight_schrute What is that?
michael_scott Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
the_doctor Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot.
michael_scott Ok, what kinda machine is that?
the_doctor Does the skin look red and swollen?
dwight_schrute That's what she said.
michael_scott That's my joke, damnit Dwight.
the_technician Tech Ok, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment...
michael_scott It's ok, they're with me.
the_technician Tech No metal of any kind.
michael_scott Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
dwight_schrute I don't want to do this.
michael_scott Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out.
dwight_schrute Oh.
michael_scott Fine. Fine.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
jim_halpert Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.
pam_beesly Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
jim_halpert Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
pam_beesly I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
jim_halpert Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.
pam_beesly Really? Michael went in with him?
jim_halpert Uh huh.
pam_beesly Wow.
jim_halpert But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
pam_beesly Ok, that's uh, good news Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.
jim_halpert Ok.
pam_beesly Ok. Bye.
jim_halpert Bye.
pam_beesly Hey, Oscar?
oscar_martinez What's up, Pam?
pam_beesly I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok. The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.
oscar_martinez Ok...
pam_beesly I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.
the_technician Tech Ok Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three. One, two, uh Sir? Stop that. Stop. Stop that.
