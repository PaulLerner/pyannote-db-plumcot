pam_beesly Yeah, that's no problem.
michael_scott Pam?
pam_beesly Sure. Uh huh.
michael_scott Pam? Knock, knock.
pam_beesly I'm on the phone.
michael_scott I know you are. Knock, knock.
pam_beesly You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
michael_scott 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
pam_beesly 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. It really makes us look unprofessional.
michael_scott They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock.
pam_beesly Who's there?
michael_scott Buddha.
pam_beesly Buddha who?
michael_scott Buddha this bread for me, won't you?
pam_beesly Great.
michael_scott I, I need something to wipe my hand.
pam_beesly Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
michael_scott That was helping. It was classic.
dwight_schrute I got a knock-knock joke.
michael_scott No... God.
dwight_schrute OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
michael_scott Alright.
dwight_schrute Knock, knock.
michael_scott Who's there?
dwight_schrute KGB.
michael_scott KGB -
dwight_schrute We will ask the questions!
michael_scott What the hell was that?
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
michael_scott What are you doing?
dwight_schrute Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
michael_scott You, you like that?
dwight_schrute C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
michael_scott Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
jim_halpert Ding Dong.
michael_scott Who's there?
jim_halpert KGB.
michael_scott Dwight, get the door.
dwight_schrute I'm not answering it.
michael_scott Answer the door.
jim_halpert Ding dong.
dwight_schrute No way, it's the KGB.
jim_halpert Ding dong.
dwight_schrute I'm not answering that. You answer it.
michael_scott I'm not gonna answer it
dwight_schrute I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB.
jim_halpert The KGB will wait for no one!
dwight_schrute It's true.
pam_beesly Good morning, Michael.
michael_scott Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
pam_beesly Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
michael_scott Why thank you very much. Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
pam_beesly Jelly beans.
michael_scott No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
michael_scott The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
michael_scott I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. Umm hmm.
jim_halpert We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
michael_scott Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
jim_halpert 'Free paper.'
michael_scott No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
andy_bernard Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
michael_scott No, you don't. No, it - What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
kevin_malone I think I should call her.
andy_bernard No! No! No!
kevin_malone Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
andy_bernard You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
kevin_malone But I do like her just the way she is.
andy_bernard Well that's not what we agreed on.
jim_halpert What are you doing?
andy_bernard Huh?
jim_halpert Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
andy_bernard No.
pam_beesly You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
andy_bernard You're asking him to give up all of his power.
jim_halpert What power?
kevin_malone Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
andy_bernard You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'
pam_beesly That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
jim_halpert Well guys with girlfriends don't.
andy_bernard That's low, Tuna.
jim_halpert Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. One of my clients found a golden ticket. Yup. No, congratulations.
michael_scott Woo hoo.
jim_halpert I'll take that down right now.
michael_scott Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
jim_halpert I'm on the phone.
michael_scott ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
jim_halpert Hold on one second.
michael_scott Invite them on the tour.
jim_halpert It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
michael_scott Really? That's kind of a big client. Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
oscar_martinez Ten percent?
michael_scott Yeah?
oscar_martinez They're our largest client.
michael_scott Yeah.
oscar_martinez It's gonna hurt.
jim_halpert Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
jim_halpert How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
michael_scott I thought I did. So...
jim_halpert OK...
michael_scott Well no harm no foul.
jim_halpert ...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
michael_scott You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
michael_scott Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
darryl_philbin Start over.
michael_scott Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
darryl_philbin Were the boxes near each other?
michael_scott Irrelevant.
darryl_philbin I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
michael_scott OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
michael_scott My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. That...
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
pam_beesly When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
michael_scott Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?
oscar_martinez They can.
michael_scott No, they can't.
oscar_martinez Yes, they can.
michael_scott Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
oscar_martinez Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
michael_scott Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
jim_halpert So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
michael_scott Thank you, Jim is with me.
jim_halpert Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
michael_scott Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
creed_bratton That's not why.
michael_scott OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. Yes.
pam_beesly Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later?
jim_halpert Good one.
michael_scott OK, don't get that. Please?
stanley_hudson I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
michael_scott That is not constructive.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
michael_scott Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
david_wallace Michael, what the hell is going on here?
michael_scott How are you doing?
david_wallace Fine. What is going on?
michael_scott My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
david_wallace Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
michael_scott Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
david_wallace How could you not know Michael?
michael_scott I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
david_wallace Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
michael_scott You're breaking up.
david_wallace Michael?
michael_scott OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
david_wallace Was it the sales department?
michael_scott Yes.
david_wallace Was it Jim?
michael_scott No.
david_wallace OK, was it Dwight?
michael_scott Yes.
michael_scott Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
dwight_schrute That was your idea.
michael_scott Woah, wow, who told you that?
dwight_schrute You did. Several times. Over and over again.
michael_scott No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
dwight_schrute You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
michael_scott I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
dwight_schrute Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
michael_scott Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
dwight_schrute You don't keep a diary.
michael_scott Yes I do. You've just never seen it. March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
dwight_schrute Hold that thought. March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
michael_scott Why do you have a diary?
dwight_schrute To keep secrets from my computer.
michael_scott OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
dwight_schrute Impossible.
michael_scott Yes, you did.
dwight_schrute I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
michael_scott What are you writing?
dwight_schrute Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
michael_scott Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
dwight_schrute With all my heart.
kevin_malone You guys are throwing a lot at me.
jim_halpert All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
kevin_malone Right.
pam_beesly I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
jim_halpert No, that is what I mean.
pam_beesly Shush. Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
kevin_malone Like that?
jim_halpert No, stop it.
andy_bernard Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
andy_bernard ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
michael_scott We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
dwight_schrute OK, what am I thinking right now?
michael_scott Umm, nacho chips.
dwight_schrute No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
michael_scott Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
dwight_schrute Oh, not gonna happen.
dwight_schrute I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
michael_scott Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
dwight_schrute What about Shoe La La?
michael_scott It's not ready yet.
michael_scott I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
michael_scott May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
oscar_martinez These aren't announcements.
michael_scott Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
dwight_schrute I love working here and I do not want to leave.
michael_scott He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
dwight_schrute Well...
michael_scott I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
dwight_schrute We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
michael_scott Right.
dwight_schrute No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
michael_scott That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
dwight_schrute Try me.
michael_scott That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
dwight_schrute I haven't made a decision yet.
michael_scott You kind of have.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott Yes.
jim_halpert You cannot take the fall for him.
dwight_schrute He said he would do the same for me.
jim_halpert He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
dwight_schrute I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
jim_halpert There it is.
michael_scott Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
david_wallace That's too bad.
michael_scott Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
david_wallace Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight.
dwight_schrute David... you're welcome.
david_wallace I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute?
david_wallace Alright Dwight. This is huge.
dwight_schrute That's what she said!
michael_scott Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
dwight_schrute Inspiration.
michael_scott Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?
dwight_schrute You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
michael_scott Give me the details of how that happened.
jim_halpert You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
dwight_schrute Apology rejected.
pam_beesly Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Oh Pam.
creed_bratton Good work, kid.
dwight_schrute Thanks old man.
david_wallace This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
david_wallace Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
pam_beesly Sure.
michael_scott David? David?
dwight_schrute 'Cause I've got this idea...
michael_scott David?
david_wallace Yeah?
michael_scott Could I be a part of the meeting also?
david_wallace You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
jim_halpert Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie.
dwight_schrute Alright.
david_wallace Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
dwight_schrute OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
angela_martin on phone Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there? I hear panting.
david_wallace No. No dogs.
dwight_schrute So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea .
michael_scott There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
pam_beesly It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
dwight_schrute Pam...
michael_scott I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
dwight_schrute That is my idea.
david_wallace We are gonna call you back guys. What is going on here?
michael_scott OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
david_wallace No, no.
dwight_schrute It is my idea.
michael_scott Oh how dare you.
dwight_schrute It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
michael_scott You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
dwight_schrute Horse Boat.
michael_scott Oh please.
dwight_schrute A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
michael_scott Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
dwight_schrute Oh give me a break.
michael_scott ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
dwight_schrute That's because they're easy!
michael_scott They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
dwight_schrute Women's urinals... uh...
david_wallace Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
dwight_schrute Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
michael_scott Thank You!
david_wallace What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
michael_scott Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
david_wallace OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
pam_beesly OK.
david_wallace I am gone.
michael_scott When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
dwight_schrute Oh I am. In my own words.
michael_scott I want to see it.
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott I want to see it.
dwight_schrute No, Michael.
michael_scott Give me... Give me the diary.
dwight_schrute No!
lynn Hi.
kevin_malone Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
lynn OK.
kevin_malone I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
lynn OK.
kevin_malone Nice. Boobs.
andy_bernard Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!
dwight_schrute Ding dong.
jim_halpert Who is it?
dwight_schrute KGB.
jim_halpert Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
dwight_schrute When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
jim_halpert Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
dwight_schrute We have more houses to visit.
jim_halpert If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
dwight_schrute We will come back at... how is 4 45?
jim_halpert I get back from work around 6.
dwight_schrute How about 5 15?
jim_halpert You can try. That, that might work.
dwight_schrute Very well, we will come back at 5 15.
jim_halpert Alright.
