meredith_palmer Guy I got a delivery for ya'.
michael_scott Leave it at reception.
meredith_palmer I'm supposed to deliver this one in person.
michael_scott Clean up on aisle five.
michael_scott After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level Midnight.
michael_scott Erin... what are you doing?
erin_hannon Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
michael_scott That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
jim_halpert Threat Level Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
pam_beesly We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
jim_halpert Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
pam_beesly Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
pam_beesly We'd love to see it!
michael_scott Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
pam_beesly Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
creed_bratton Thanks mom.
holly_flax You never told me you made a movie.
michael_scott Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
holly_flax It's got you.
michael_scott It's got a lot of me.
holly_flax I can't wait.
michael_scott Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level Midnight.
stanley_hudson Michael Scarn, well that's an interesting story. He was once the best secret agent in the business. That was years ago. Where is he now? Well, that's also an interesting story.
dwight_schrute Master Scarn.
dwight_schrute I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- to be like this! But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
michael_scott Dwight does not play a robot.
dwight_schrute
michael_scott I'm up.
dwight_schrute It's the president. He needs you for a mission.
michael_scott Tell him I'm retired.
dwight_schrute It's Goldenface.
michael_scott Goldenface, this makes it personal.
darryl_philbin Scarn, you're right on time.
darryl_philbin I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
darryl_philbin It's your old enemy, Goldenface. He's after the NHL All Star Game. He's hidden a bomb somewhere in the stadium. Scarn, this one is personal for me. I own the stadium. I can't see it blown up. It's my retirement plan.
dwight_schrute We have to search the stadium.
darryl_philbin Not so fast, Goldenface has taken all the concession stand workers hostage. Scarn, will you find these hostages, and save the game?
michael_scott Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven. Heads. Tails. ...Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails. Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five.
stanley_hudson Well, the hostages were scared.
kevin_malone Don't you guys get it? Nobody's coming for us.
jim_halpert Oh someone's coming alright, the only man who would care. Michael Scarn. See I'm gonna lure him here, then I kill everybody, then... I'm gonna dig up Scarn's dead wife, and I'm gonna hump her real good.
jim_halpert I did not love the dialogue. Or the character. I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
stanley_hudson Well, the All Star Game was three days away, so naturally it was all sold out. The only way Scarn was getting in was in a uniform. Just one problem with that, Scarn didn't know a hockey stick from a Slim Jim. So he went to meet with the famed trainer... Cherokee Jack. Cherokee
Jack#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode16 Mop the ice.
michael_scott I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey. Cherokee
Jack#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode16 Mop it. Now take this.
michael_scott What am I supposed to do with this? Cherokee
Jack#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode16 Mop.
stanley_hudson Well, Michael Scarn was quickly becoming one of the hottest hockey players in the country.
ryan_howard Each year, the National Hockey League selects one civilian amateur to play in the All Star Game. It's down to the three of you. The final test is speed skating. On your marks, get set...
jim_halpert Die!
michael_scott Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.
jim_halpert I wasn't trying to kill you, I was trying to slow you down.
michael_scott No!
jim_halpert Oh by the way!
michael_scott Yeah?
jim_halpert How's your wife doing?
michael_scott
michael_scott Congratulations.
oscar_martinez Hey, you came in second. Not bad either.
michael_scott I am sorry that I have to do this...
oscar_martinez Huh...
michael_scott I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
dwight_schrute I'm intercepting a name. Jasmine Winsong. She works for Goldenface. What I can't figure out is, who is the Funky Cat.
michael_scott Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town.
dwight_schrute Oh-
dwight_schrute He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
jan_levinson They call me Jasmine Winsong.
michael_scott Bingo.
jan_levinson He finished his movie? No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
jan_levinson
michael_scott
jan_levinson The hostages are under the stadium.
michael_scott Jack Blaise.
pam_beesly You have to let us go Goldenface! We have families!
jim_halpert Ha! This is gonna show them that I mean business. See ya!
michael_scott By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
dwight_schrute Ha!
kevin_malone Michael Scarn!
jim_halpert Sorry about your friend, Scarn!
michael_scott The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?
jim_halpert Hm?
dwight_schrute We've searched the whole building, Goldenface, where is the bomb?
jim_halpert Hm?
dwight_schrute We've searched the wh- ok...
michael_scott He said, where is the bomb?
jim_halpert In the puck!
michael_scott Why are you telling me this?
jim_halpert Because I'm going to kill you. Unless! You forgive me for murdering your wife.
michael_scott Hey Goldenface.
jim_halpert Yeah?
michael_scott Go puck yourself!
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute Noooo!
michael_scott That was not scripted.
jim_halpert
michael_scott More Tylenol.
helene_beesly You've already had four.
pam_beesly Oh God... So good.
helene_beesly You're lucky to be alive.
michael_scott It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.
helene_beesly Let's just make sure that everything's... Working properly...
darryl_philbin You just said the bomb... is in the puck? Michael and Samuel
together#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode16 Yes.
darryl_philbin Is that where you hid the bomb Goldenface?
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute But why would you blow up the stadium? You OWN the stadium!
michael_scott For the insurance money! I knew it all along! You will never get away with this!
michael_scott Where had I gone wrong? All I wanted was to start a family with my beautiful wife. But somewhere along the way, things got messed up.
stanley_hudson It wasn't easy for Scarn to admit that he had lost his self-confidence. And he hadn't of course, He just wasn't using it right now.
michael_scott Beer me Billy.
hidetoshi_hasagawa You don't looks so good, what's got ya down?
michael_scott I got problems Billy. Big problems...
hidetoshi_hasagawa You got problems?! My TV don't work! I pay thirty bucks a month for the damn satellite what's-a-whosit, I can't even get the damn game! Now you tell me, what's worse than that?
michael_scott Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
hidetoshi_hasagawa I see what you mean about problems. I know what'll cheer you up. That table of bachelorettes over there bought you this drink.
karen_filippelli Ever banged an entire bachelorette party, baby?
karen_filippelli Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
michael_scott I'm too depressed to save the big game Billy.
hidetoshi_hasagawa I'm gonna cheer you up, the only ways I know hows. Hey kid! Hit G-9 on the Jukebox!
michael_scott No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died.
hidetoshi_hasagawa There is a whole crowd of people out there, who need to learn, how to do The Scarn.
michael_scott Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way. You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! Todd
todd_packer If doing The Scarn is gay, then I'm the biggest queer on Earth!
jim_halpert Sorry.
michael_scott
jim_halpert I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
kelly_kapoor Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
kevin_malone It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
ryan_howard You should enter it in festivals!
kevin_malone Or carnivals!
michael_scott Well that's a... pretty good reaction. Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
holly_flax Uh... which part?
michael_scott Okay. No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
andy_bernard Some people are really popping on screen!
michael_scott Hey.
holly_flax Hey! Good movie.
michael_scott Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
holly_flax I loved it.
michael_scott Did you? What did you love about it?
holly_flax Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
michael_scott No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.
holly_flax Uhm...
michael_scott Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
holly_flax Not worried about that.
michael_scott It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
holly_flax Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
michael_scott I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
holly_flax Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
michael_scott Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
holly_flax Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
michael_scott I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
holly_flax I'm real.
michael_scott Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
holly_flax I love you too.
michael_scott I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films. Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
michael_scott Who likes Threat Level Midnight? Okay then who wants to watch the rest?!
dwight_schrute Michael! You have to get to that puck before halftime! Or the whole stadium will explode!
michael_scott I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!
dwight_schrute Cherokee Jack? Michael he died.
michael_scott This one's for you Cherokee Jack.
michael_scott We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
jim_halpert That's fine, it's great!
michael_scott No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there.
pam_beesly Why is your face gold?
jim_halpert Why do you care?
pam_beesly I'm just making conversation.
jim_halpert I worked in a gold factory, we had a boss, who only cared about money...
michael_scott Hey...
holly_flax Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
michael_scott No it's not. It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
Hostage#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode16 Please Goldenface, let us go!
michael_scott Cherokee Jack. Cherokee
Jack#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode16 I want you to take all of your frustrations, with women, the system, with everything. Take it out on the puck. All on the puck.
michael_scott
michael_scott
dwight_schrute Yah!
hidetoshi_hasagawa Hey! We got sports games again!
jim_halpert Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh-
michael_scott Some breakfast for me and some breakfast for you.
michael_scott Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
michael_scott I'll get it! Man I love being retired! Scarn here!
darryl_philbin Michael, it's the president.
michael_scott Hello sir.
darryl_philbin I need you for another mission.
michael_scott Ugh... I'm in.
andy_bernard Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
michael_scott Oh yeah! Yes he is!
dwight_schrute No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
michael_scott No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid.
stanley_hudson Well, Michael Scarn was back in the game. And I bet you're wondering why do I know so much about Michael Scarn. Well because I AM Michael Scarn.
Rapper#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode16 Ahhhh, yeah! Threat Level Midnight! Makes all the girlies feel alright! From Madonna to Madelyn Allbrite, Threat Level Midnight! It's a threat, a level, a level level threat. He's the greatest hockey-star I ever seen yet. Threat Level what? Midnight! Threat Level who? Michael Scarn! Threat Level why? Apartheid! Gotta fight it, Free Mandela! Peace I'm out!
