dwight_schrute Aren't they magnificent?

dwight_schrute I love finding a good set of twins.
michael_scott Something is wrong with you.
darryl_philbin Go Meredith. Nice moves.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
kelly_kapoor Lame! What else you got, Andy?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 How about a little bit of this.
darryl_philbin Oh yeah. What else you got?
kevin_malone What else you got?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo!
darryl_philbin What else you got?
kevin_malone It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Pam's here. Pam?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.
pam_beesly What?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.
pam_beesly Andy, I am getting married in 8 hours.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Everyone else is too drunk. Just don't let me die here.
pam_beesly Hey, hey! Where are you? Can you take Andy to the hospital?
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly He tore his scrotum dancing.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly He is in my room icing his balls.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly Please stop saying what. Can you take him?
jim_halpert Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
pam_beesly Your brothers took you out drinking?
jim_halpert Uh...
michael_scott Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.
pam_beesly That's Michael. You're out with Michael?
jim_halpert And Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hey-O!
jim_halpert Pam, it just happened.
pam_beesly Okay, fine. I'll take him.
jim_halpert I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
michael_scott I love you!
pam_beesly Are you pushing me off the phone?
jim_halpert No. Let's talk for a long time.
pam_beesly Goodbye.
michael_scott Mmm! It's after midnight.
michael_scott and Dwight You're married. He's married!
dwight_schrute Congratulations.
jim_halpert That's not how that works.
dwight_schrute Oh my goodness.
michael_scott Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.
dwight_schrute You'll have Pam to answer to.
michael_scott She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons." "And... and clip my toenails."
dwight_schrute "Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."
michael_scott Now you sound like Kermit.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Are you sure this is the right way?
pam_beesly Nope. I, like you, have never been here before.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
pam_beesly Look, I'm not the one who asked you to do a split when you've never done one before.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--
pam_beesly My job? My job is to get married in the morning. That's my job.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Ow, ow!
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
pam_beesly Andy, did I dream that you were crying through the night?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 No. No that was real.
michael_scott Why don't you take a picture. It'll last longer. God. Can't I get a little privacy?
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Employee Good morning. How can I help you?
kevin_malone I left a pair of dress shoes in a bag outside my door last night to be cleaned at polished, but they haven't been returned yet.
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Employee You must be Mr. Malone. One moment please.
kevin_malone Thank you.
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Employee Sir. It's the man with the shoes.
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Manager Mr. Malone. Your shoes are gone.
kevin_malone They were stolen?
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Manager No. Destroyed.
kevin_malone What?
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Manager The bag was opened by our shoe shine and the smell overcame him. I too smelled them and made the choice that they must be thrown away. Incinerated actually.
kevin_malone But that was my only pair of shoes.
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Manager It became a safety issue, sir.
kevin_malone Well... well damn-it.
Hotel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Employee I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.
kevin_malone Okay.
dwight_schrute You have everything?
isabel_poreba Hmm-hmm.
dwight_schrute Cell phone? Charger?
isabel_poreba Yeah. So you sure you don't want breakfast? It's the most important meal of the day.
dwight_schrute It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel.
isabel_poreba That's really sweet, Dwight. So I'll see you at the wedding?
dwight_schrute You know it.
isabel_poreba K.
dwight_schrute Okay, get out of here.
isabel_poreba Bye.
dwight_schrute Okay.
michael_scott Hey, good morning. It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half. Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit.
dwight_schrute Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.
michael_scott How can you eat like that?
dwight_schrute I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?
michael_scott Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
dwight_schrute Hey, what was she like?
michael_scott She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.
dwight_schrute Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?
michael_scott She was from Europe.
dwight_schrute No kidding.
michael_scott Uh-huh.
dwight_schrute I bet she had hairy armpits.
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
michael_scott Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?
dwight_schrute Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.
michael_scott No... you're crazy.
dwight_schrute Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.
michael_scott She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--
dwight_schrute You should ask her out.
michael_scott I already have my European girlfriend.
stanley_hudson If your hat hits me in the face one more time--
phyllis_vance That's funny. Your wife loved this hat the last time she saw it.
angela_martin Oh my God.
oscar_martinez Oh...
kevin_malone Oscar. Angela.
darryl_philbin Are you in a lot of pain?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Oh cause of last night? No way. Reports have been exaggerated. Weddings make me very emotional. I um--I just have that side to me.
darryl_philbin People say you cry all the time.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Well that's not--
meredith_palmer Crotch injuries are the worst. You don't need to tell me.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 I wasn't telling you.
meredith_palmer Is there still something there?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Excuse me?
meredith_palmer It didn't get torn off?
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 No, it didn't--nothing got torn off. Who told you that?
jim_halpert I may have told some people that. I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.
darryl_philbin If you want to sit on this-- I was thinking the wood might be too hard on your damaged pen1s. Make it softer.
Andy#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 It was my scrotum. Um, and it was. Thank you.
michael_scott Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory. And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.
dwight_schrute I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
penny_beesly Is it zipping over your belly? Don't squish the baby.
pam_beesly Thank you weirdo.
helene_beesly everybody see Kristie's stupid blonde extensions? It's like they were made from a plastic broom.
pam_beesly Okay, here I come.
helene_beesly Oh darling! You look beautiful.
pam_beesly Thanks mom.
helene_beesly Oh, I hope he deserves you.
pam_beesly He does.
helene_beesly Are you sure? Remember you don't have to do this. You don't.
penny_beesly Mom, you're totally projecting. You're being a drag.
pam_beesly Yes. Thank you, mom.
isabel_poreba Hey, I'm going to go outside and talk to Dwight.
pam_beesly Okay great. Yeah, I'll see you in a second. Wait, what? Oh! Oh no!
jim_halpert Hey!
pam_beesly Can you come here please?
jim_halpert Is this allowed?
pam_beesly No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here.
dwight_schrute That was an intelligent comment.
isabel_poreba Hello stranger. How do I look?
dwight_schrute Oh. Fine. Isabel, nice to see you. What do you want?
isabel_poreba Um... nothing. Anymore.
dwight_schrute So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
michael_scott Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?
isabel_poreba I'm standing. I'm a bridesmaid.
michael_scott Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Wow. You look--
pam_beesly Terrible.
jim_halpert So beautiful. Hey--
pam_beesly My veil tore. I knew when we were getting married and I'm five months pregnant that I'm not going to be able to wear the dress that I always wanted or high heels--
jim_halpert Hey. You look just as I imagined you would. Pam, you're so pretty.
pam_beesly Thank you.
jim_halpert And who cares? It's a stupid veil, right?
pam_beesly No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and--
jim_halpert There. Now we're even.
pam_beesly Everyone's driving me crazy. I know way too much about Andy's scrotum. And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend. This is supposed to be our wedding day. Why did we invite all these people?
phyllis_vance I think Pam ran away because she knew deep down she wouldn't be a good wife.
angela_martin Yes.
oscar_martinez What are you doing?
kevin_malone I'm trying to decide if I have time to pee.
oscar_martinez How long do you take to pee?
kevin_malone The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on.
michael_scott Hey. Hi. Do you--would you have a snack in your purse? You're a mom. I just figured you might have--
helene_beesly Oh, yeah--
michael_scott Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
helene_beesly No.
michael_scott Oh... okay. Were you saving it?
helene_beesly Oh, no, no, no. That's okay. I was just--I've had a very rough weekend.
michael_scott I'm sorry. Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.
darryl_philbin Do you think they canceled the wedding?
angela_martin Relax. You'll get your shot at Jim. Those two treat the whole office like a 1970's key party.
michael_scott my weekend was bad so far.
helene_beesly Oh--
michael_scott I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.
helene_beesly Oh that sounds awful.
michael_scott And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
helene_beesly Oh--
michael_scott It is a terrible year for love.
helene_beesly Yeah. Guess it is.
michael_scott I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
creed_bratton Halpert Excuse me, are you Michael Scott?
Michel#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode05 Um, yeah.
creed_bratton Heard you might have a whoopee cushion on you.
gerald_halpert Halpert Sisters in the can and we totally want to get her when she comes back.
michael_scott Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually. There you go. Use it in good health.
creed_bratton and Pete Yes!
meredith_palmer Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. What is the etiquette on taking the gifts? Can you only take your own back or is it a whatever you can carry type of thing?
stanley_hudson Anyone have anything they want to trade for a toaster?
kevin_malone Oh, oh, does it have slots for hot dogs?
stanley_hudson No.
kevin_malone Who would want it?
oscar_martinez Guys, maybe we should wait a little more time before we start grabbing boxes.
dwight_schrute Toby.
toby_flenderson What?
dwight_schrute I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
toby_flenderson
dwight_schrute Crap. Come here you.
toby_flenderson Well I guess this weddings not going to happen. I wonder if this is it for them.
mr_beesly Hey. What happened?
ryan_howard Where were you guys? Do you know how long I've been waiting here?
jim_halpert Well we are here now, so let's just--
michael_scott Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?
jim_halpert You look great.
pam_beesly You look great.
creed_bratton Wear a tie much?
penny_beesly I begged them not to.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
penny_beesly I know you specifically put this song on your Do Not Play list.
pam_beesly Yes I did.
penny_beesly I'm sorry.
pam_beesly Go ahead. I think it's your turn.
penny_beesly Wait, what happened? You're okay with this?
pam_beesly Yeah, I'm okay.
penny_beesly Okay then!
michael_scott Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
pam_beesly Saw it.
jim_halpert I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.
kevin_malone What an awesome party. The best wedding I've ever been too. I got six numbers. One more would have been a complete telephone number. This was epic. My Kleenex shoes were a huge conversation piece, but man my dogs are barking. Whoo. My feet were so sweaty I can't even feel the cold. What a lovely hotel.
