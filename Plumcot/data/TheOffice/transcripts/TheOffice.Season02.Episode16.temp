pam I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and.
pam Phyllis. Delivery
man Would you sign here?
pam roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
meredith "Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration. "
phyllis Isn't he sweet?
meredith Yeah. Wow.
michael Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
dwight And you want me to come with you.
michael Nope. The opposite of that.
dwight I will stay here and run things on this end.
michael Ok, good.
dwight Question. Will you be seeing jan when you're in New York?
michael I probably will, why do you ask?
dwight Well. It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know.
michael Yeah.
dwight Screwed.
michael What is your problem?
michael This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
michael Hey, Pam. You heart N. Y, right? You want me to pick you up anything?
pam That's OK.
michael Alright.
oscar The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
michael Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
michael Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
jim So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
dwight What's this? What is this?
jim I dunno, it's on your desk.
dwight Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
jim It was there when I sat down.
dwight Happy Valentine's Day. It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! Ahh!
michael The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice.
jim Hey Kelly. What's up?
kelly Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
jim OH, that's great. I'm really happy for
kelly And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like "Ryan, what's taking you so long?" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
jim Wow.
kelly So I said, "Ryan, what took you so long?" And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
jim Wow.
kelly Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
jim No, don't be.
kelly Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
jim I bet.
kelly So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
jim Alright.
ryan I hooked up with her on February 13th.
michael Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
kevin Woah.
pam Guess what?
phyllis Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
pam That's great.
michael Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
michael This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey . That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So. Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
dwight Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
angela Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
dwight Oh I did. I did.
angela I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
dwight Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
angela Really? Well, I hope I do.
michael I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
jim Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
kevin Woah, woah Delivery

craig Hey.
josh michael Scott.
michael josh Porter, high five. Bam.
josh You know dan Gore from Buffalo.
michael Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.
craig What's up buddy?
michael You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
craig Guilty, yeah.
michael So what's going on? What I miss?
josh Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
michael Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and.
dwight Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you. privately?
pam You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
dwight No, Pam, Just. Just,
pam You need to get something for your girlfriend.
dwight Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of.
pam Tightly wound?
dwight Exactly.
pam Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
dwight You mean, like a ham?
pam No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
dwight Ok, I get it.
pam That you remember her.
dwight Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. . push;
josh What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
craig Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said "You gotta fire four people, " and I was just like, "What?" Ya know?
josh Did you?
craig No, I just ignored her. She's the worse.
josh She is our boss.
craig She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.
michael Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
craig What? You like Jan? How can you like Jan?
michael Maybe because she's my girlfriend. Was, or not my girlfriend. She's. we hooked up and.
josh You hooked up with Jan?
michael You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
josh Yeah, let's change the subject.
michael Yeah, yeah.
kelly I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
jim Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need.
ryan Soda.
kelly Cool. Hey, so. do you want to. do something tonight? Or.
jim Oh, no, not while I'm here.
kelly I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So.
ryan I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
kelly OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
ryan Cool. Cool. OK.
jan josh Porter, Stamford.
david david
josh Nice to meet you.
jan And michael Scott, Scranton.
david Nice to meet you.
michael Ditto. How are you Jan?
jan Fine Michael. Thank you.
david OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to.
jan Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
josh So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
david Thanks very much.
josh Thank you.
david OK, Michael.
michael What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, david and Jan, it is much more.
michael Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
michael Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.
michael And finally, pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home.
michael Questions?
david Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
michael Yes, thank you.
david But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
michael Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm. Delivery
man Can you sign?
pam Yeah.
pam Oscar.
angela Nothing for me?
pam Join the club.
kevin Whose it from?
oscar My mom.
kelly It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
jim You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
kelly Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
jim Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
kelly Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan?
dan And that about does it, thank you.
jan OK. Craig,
craig Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on. like report or whatnot.
jan Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
craig I was under the impression this was, more of like. a meet and greet type deal.
david So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
craig That is correct, yes.
jan Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
craig Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
jan Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
craig Oh man, you know what? michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too.
michael Oh, ok. Alright.
jan NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just. I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
michael No you're not.
jan Yeah, michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
michael Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So.
jan Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
michael Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
jan Surely, you cannot be serious?
michael I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
dwight Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
roy Hey babe.
pam Hey.
roy You almost ready to go?
pam I guess, yeah.
roy What's wrong?
pam Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
roy What, you're mad at me?
pam I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me something for Valentine's Day.
roy Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best s*x of you life.
david You understand this is a very serious situation.
michael No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and craig the idiot took it seriously.
david You made a joke?
michael I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.
david Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss.
michael I know. It was borderline at best and. And jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
jan Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
david Good.
pam Heading out?
jim Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
pam Bye.
phyllis Goodnight Pam.
pam Night Phyllis.
jan Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
michael Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
jan Oh, no, it's OK. So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
michael Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.
jan Oh.
michael Oy vey. schmear.
