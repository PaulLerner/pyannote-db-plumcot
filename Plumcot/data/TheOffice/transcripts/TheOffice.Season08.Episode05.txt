andy_bernard Approved!
andy_bernard Chef from South Park, it's genius!
stanley_hudson Just some chef.
andy_bernard I've decided to pre-screen all the Halloween costumes this year. I have three simple rules - don't be offensive, don't be cliche, and don't take the first two rules too seriously.
kevin_malone The gorilla from Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Huh? The one who sacrifices his life.
andy_bernard Whoa! Aw, spoiler alert.
kevin_malone It's been out for ages, man.
andy_bernard Costume vetoed.
andy_bernard Ah, it's, uh... somebody's already called that.
phyllis_vance Who?
andy_bernard Kevin has a gorilla suit you could borrow.
kelly_kapoor This is ridiculous! Why can't there just be two Kate Middleton's?
andy_bernard Guys, I know, I mean, I wish there could be, too. It's like, I can't choose. They're both amazing. It's just...
kelly_kapoor Look, I stayed up all night and I watched that gd wedding, and then I came to work and I made everyone else watch it all day. Meredith wasn't even here.
meredith_palmer Because I was there. Your the people's princess! Diana was nothing!
andy_bernard I thought you were at your sister's funeral.
meredith_palmer What I said was, "My sister's funeral is this weekend." Didn't say I'd be there.
meredith_palmer Why is it such a shock that I follow the royal story? Warms my heart, thinking about them two kids, doing it.
andy_bernard Um, can I, maybe, squeeze through?
erin_hannon Here you go.
andy_bernard There you go. Thank you.
erin_hannon When they talk about all the nice things about dating a coworker, they don't mention one of the best parts. After you're done dating, you still get to work together, every single day.
kevin_malone Jim, put it on.
darryl_philbin Put it on, man.
jim_halpert I don't know if I can.
kevin_malone Come on, the Three Amigos.
darryl_philbin Three Kings.
jim_halpert Alright.
jim_halpert I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.
ryan_howard If you get into season 1, you can really...
kelly_kapoor Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
dwight_schrute It's called a costume.
kelly_kapoor What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
dwight_schrute Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
ryan_howard Whoopi Goldberg.
dwight_schrute Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
toby_flenderson Every Halloween I tell him the same thing - You can't bring weapons into the office, and every year he says the same thing - As soon as I get my weapons back I'm gonna kill you. But there I am at Thanksgiving, alive, you know. I'm a lucky turkey.
andy_bernard Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?
andy_bernard I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - "Boo!" Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - "Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high." Scared the s**t out of me.
andy_bernard G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?
pam_beesly Yeah.
andy_bernard Australian accent...
pam_beesly What are you doing?
erin_hannon Oh, I just wanted to see how you do it, if you're doing something I don't.
pam_beesly Oh. Are you...
erin_hannon That Andy, so hot and cold. One day he's like, fax these documents, please. The next he's like, Pam, you fax them, who cares what Erin's feeling, right?
pam_beesly Oh, Erin...
erin_hannon Pam, how would you rate me as a receptionist on a scale of 1 to 3?
pam_beesly Um, 2?
erin_hannon That's like, the second to last thing I wanted to hear.
pam_beesly No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?
erin_hannon Yeah...
pam_beesly Yeah.
erin_hannon Send completed. You are the best in the biz, I can't deny.
phyllis_vance Bob and I are doing this Scranton Haunted Walking Tour.
oscar_martinez I always wondered what kind of people went on that thing.
pam_beesly Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.
oscar_martinez What happened, Pam?
pam_beesly Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...
phyllis_vance Wait, they have food there?
pam_beesly ...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.
jim_halpert No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.
jim_halpert Hey.
pam_beesly Hey!
jim_halpert Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?
pam_beesly What do you mean?
jim_halpert Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
pam_beesly I saw a ghost.
jim_halpert Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
pam_beesly It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.
jim_halpert Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
pam_beesly I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.
andy_bernard Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!
robert_california Yes, Andrew. And you, on this day of fantasy, are a laborer.
andy_bernard Yes.
robert_california Everyone, this Bert, my son. Bert, this is... a paper company.
bert_california Hello. Can I use a computer? I need to check a hurricane.
robert_california Here, use this one.
robert_california Oh, look, Pin The Wart On The Wench. How did you know I was bringing my son?
erin_hannon Oh, I didn't. It was for us, but he can play. Bertie-boy, would you like to play this game?
bert_california That stuff's for babies.
robert_california Well, perhaps this party will awaken the baby in all of us.
andy_bernard Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.
robert_california Extraordinary. Did you plan this?
kelly_kapoor Well, Toby and I did, yeah.
gabe_lewis And I overheard, and thought, hey, that'd be fun, don't mind if I do.
toby_flenderson If you turn out the lights we'll do a little dance.
kelly_kapoor 1, 2, 3!
gabe_lewis@kelly_kapoor@toby_flenderson Dem bones, dem bones, dem tired bones, now we're the skeleton crew.
robert_california Delightful.
kelly_kapoor Thank you.
robert_california Now then, how are we today?
kelly_kapoor Fine.
toby_flenderson Great.
robert_california Just fine, Kelly? Everything alright?
kelly_kapoor Mmhmm.
robert_california You feeling fulfilled in your life?
kelly_kapoor I guess.
robert_california You guess? So, there is something you want that you do not have.
kelly_kapoor I try not to think about it.
robert_california Because it's too terrifying to imagine. Now we're cooking. What is it, Kelly? What is this great fear of yours?
kelly_kapoor Never marrying.
robert_california Yes. Dying alone, that is very scary. And how are you, Toby?
toby_flenderson So great.
erin_hannon Oh, I put those up.
angela_martin I know. I'm taking them down.
phyllis_vance I almost wonder if putting nothing on this wall is more Halloween-y.
erin_hannon I don't know about this, guys, Andy put me in charge of the Halloween party, so...
angela_martin Well, Andy sent us in here, so which is it?
erin_hannon Oh.
angela_martin So, can we speak our minds now, or are we still sparing feelings, because I hate all of this.
bert_california Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm.
dwight_schrute Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
bert_california What are you, anyway?
dwight_schrute I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
bert_california If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft.
dwight_schrute Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
bert_california If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl.
dwight_schrute Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
bert_california Yeah, she also has boobs.
dwight_schrute Yeah, but no nipples.
erin_hannon Hey.
andy_bernard Hey. What's up?
erin_hannon November's sure creeping up, ain't it? Can't stop that month!
andy_bernard Yeah...
erin_hannon Hey, what's the jive with Angela and Phyllis helping with the party, you know?
andy_bernard Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.
erin_hannon But that's it? There's nothing about me, or I?
andy_bernard Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.
erin_hannon Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes, we can.
andy_bernard Yes. I don't know. Mmhmm.
erin_hannon Gabe?
gabe_lewis Sweetheart.
erin_hannon I'm throwing the Halloween Party and I just want to amp it up a little. I think it could use some extra pizazz.
gabe_lewis Ok where does Gabe factor in?
erin_hannon Remember that Halloween party you took me to once? The one where I started crying as soon as I walked in and I didn't stop crying?
gabe_lewis Yes. Lars and Decocco's
erin_hannon Ok. Let's say that I wanted this party to be a tiny, tiny bit like that one. Just... more adult... more... scary and sexy
gabe_lewis I will make this sexier than you could ever imagine.
erin_hannon No â€“ just scary. If we wanted ideas for scary stuff.
gabe_lewis Oh that would be scary!
erin_hannon What are you thinking?
gabe_lewis Ok let me go get it.
pam_beesly Pam Halpert.
jim_halpert Hey it's Jim Halpert. I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight. Because I've read a lot about this really great documentary.
pam_beesly Is it called Ghostbusters?
jim_halpert It's called Ghostbusters.
pam_beesly It didn't look like that.
jim_halpert It didn't have a buster sign around him? Why don't you draw him? Why don't we see this whole thing.
pam_beesly Ok fine I'll draw him.
jim_halpert I ain't fraid of no ghost. Whoa!
pam_beesly Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?
dwight_schrute It's a root you idiot.
bert_california Everyone hates you.
dwight_schrute That's really rude. I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.
bert_california What do you like? Tornadoes?
dwight_schrute Try influenza.
bert_california Oh yeah? What's the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?
dwight_schrute Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane's coming. I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
bert_california Try a box jelly fish.
jim_halpert You know that's...
robert_california What are we talking about?
jim_halpert I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
robert_california You seem unimpressed. Ghosts don't scare you?
kevin_malone I'm only scared of real things like serial killers and kidnappers. Not things that don't exist like ghosts or mummies.
oscar_martinez Mummies are real. There are mummies at museums.
kevin_malone Yeah ...prank
robert_california It's true. They've been preserved for thousands of years. They're all over.
kevin_malone Why on Earth would a museum put a mummy in it?!?
erin_hannon Witch's brew?
erin_hannon I grew this party up real fast. Get out of here little kid party. Nobody loves you. And clean up your room! Grownups are going to use it later! Oooh!
jim_halpert Party looks fun doesn't it? Everybody seems to be in there having a great time. So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.
bert_california I'm using it. I'm about to play Starcraft with him .
jim_halpert Are you serious?
dwight_schrute Yeah I'm serious.
jim_halpert That's funny. Ok.
dwight_schrute Loser.
bert_california Yeah.
angela_martin Pam do you think anyone's going to notice I've worn this costume before? When I wasn't pregnant. You know I bet nobody would believe it still fits.
oscar_martinez Hey guys. I'm an Oscar liar weiner.
ryan_howard Oh my god!
darryl_philbin This party's tight. The fog is cool.
erin_hannon Thanks. It's on medium.
darryl_philbin Perfect.
andy_bernard It really looks great. You did a great job.
erin_hannon Oh, so we don't have to have that talk.
andy_bernard We should still have that talk. Maybe you can come by my office at like 4 45? Cool.
erin_hannon Oookayyy everybody. Be prepared to be scared. Ok.
gabe_lewis The cinema of the unsettling is a growing film movement. The most well known film in the genre is an hour long shot of a squirrel with diarrhea.
oscar_martinez Is that my grandmother?
andy_bernard What's the story?
oscar_martinez There is no story.
gabe_lewis Yeah it seems like there isn't a narrative. Maybe the filmmaker realized that even narrative is comforting.
stanley_hudson What the hell is going on here?
andy_bernard I think we've seen enough. You can turn it off now. Yeah turn it off now.
stanley_hudson How did you get in my car?
oscar_martinez Where is this from? That is so upsetting!
andy_bernard That was awful. Robert I apologize.
erin_hannon I'm sorry. I got confused. I heard you wanted to make the party more adult. But I think I know what to do now . This game is called "pecker Poker". It's the game of cards that gets you hard.
andy_bernard What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.
robert_california Why didn't you simply ask Andy to clarify? Asking is a very easy thing to do. You're obviously very close. . Oh I see. This no longer seems like my business .
erin_hannon All I know is you wanted to have a talk with me and I got nervous so...
robert_california You were going to talk at the end of the... I'm not here.
andy_bernard Did you think I was going to fire you? No I wasn't. I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.
robert_california I'm never uncomfortable.
andy_bernard Ok. Erin I think you know I've been dating someone.
erin_hannon Sure.
andy_bernard And it's getting a little more serious. She's never come by.
erin_hannon And she's never called here. Unless it's your mom.
andy_bernard No I didn't want her to call because I thought it would be weird. But now it's weird that she's not calling.
erin_hannon Two dates? Three dates?
andy_bernard Thirty-one.
erin_hannon Wow. I'm so happy for you guys. Um let me know when you get to forty. I'll see you guys.
robert_california I should go.
darryl_philbin I just don't get it, Pam. I mean, you're a rational person.
jim_halpert Thank you.
pam_beesly Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?
jim_halpert Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.
pam_beesly Really.
jim_halpert No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
kevin_malone Exactly.
jim_halpert Thank you.
dwight_schrute Go, get up there right now.
bert_california Got it.
darryl_philbin Dwight?
dwight_schrute You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
bert_california Unleash the hellstorm.
darryl_philbin Dwight.
dwight_schrute Nice.
darryl_philbin Dwight!
dwight_schrute Got 'em. Go!
phyllis_vance Is she Asian?
erin_hannon I don't know. She's from somewhere, I bet. Maybe from the forest.
phyllis_vance Forest? Did Andy say his girlfriend's from the forest?
erin_hannon I don't know, Phyllis. Maybe she's from the city.
phyllis_vance Hmm.
robert_california Looks terribly real, doesn't it, Creed?
creed_bratton No...
robert_california Are you scared of snakes?
creed_bratton You don't live as long as I have without a healthy fear of snakes, Bobby.
darryl_philbin [in the bathroom with Robert[ Yeah, I guess sometimes I have nightmares about being buried alive.
meredith_palmer Honestly, Jim gives me the creeps.
robert_california What am I up to?
jim_halpert Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, "Mom, there's a ghost in my closet." Now, you say one of two things - one, "You're just having a bad dream," or two, "Let's go see what it was."
pam_beesly I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim.
jim_halpert Ok.
pam_beesly I'm not gonna lie to her, either.
jim_halpert Oh, come on!
robert_california When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family's. It was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil. One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. She walked to the nursery, and there, in baby's crib, was a snake wrapped around baby's neck, squeezing tighter and tighter.
creed_bratton Oh my goodness.
robert_california The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath, reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.
kevin_malone Nooo!
robert_california Amongst them was a man, tall, slim.
meredith_palmer Jim.
robert_california Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. "Oh, wait," she thought, "I don't have a husband." For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one they couldn't get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds. She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to act and didn't, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door, "Baby, are you okay?" Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said, "I'm fine, b!tch, I'm fine."
bert_california
robert_california Fear plays an interesting role in our lives. How dare we let it motivate us. How dare we let it into our decision making, into our livelihoods, into our relationships. It's funny, isn't it, we take a day a year to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.
bert_california Toby?
toby_flenderson Oh, hey, Bert. Wanna see the dance? Dem bones, dem bones, dem dry...
bert_california You're fired.
toby_flenderson ...bones. What?
bert_california You heard me. Pack your things.
toby_flenderson What... you can't... Gabe? Are you...
bert_california I'm the CEO's son. Pack your things. You're done.
