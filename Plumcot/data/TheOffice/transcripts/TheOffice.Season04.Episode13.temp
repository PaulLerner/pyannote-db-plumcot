stanley This is ridiculous.
phyllis Do you have any idea what time we'll get out of here?
michael Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. Do you have plans tonight?
jim Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
michael Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B. S. This is B. S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! This is michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
dwight Thank you Michael.
michael all right, happy Friday. Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
jim I think you did.
michael I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
jim Oh, I-
michael You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
jim michael has asked pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
dwight Michael, what time should I be arriving?
michael Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and pam and Jim, and angela and Andy.
andy Hey-o!
dwight Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?
jan Hi.
michael Hello.
jim Hi.
jan How are you?
michael Come on in. Good to see you.
jan Chilly huh? So glad we finally got to do this with you guys. You wanna take their coats babe?
michael Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
jim Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
michael Yeah.
jim I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
michael Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
jim Really?
michael Except driving.
pam We got you this.
jan Oh well Pam, thank you, this will be great to cook with.
michael Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
pam It's really nice.
jan So what do you guys think, should we do the tour first or the appetizers first?
jim Tour, let's do the tour first.
michael Okay.
jan Do you have a preference babe? Upstairs first?
michael Totally your call babe.
jan Alright, well, let's go then, I say upstairs.
jim Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
michael Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
jan Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful carpet, we're still a work in progress here.
michael Well, thats.
jan This is my office.
michael Yep, never been used.
jan Not super exciting.
michael No.
jan And this is my workspace.
michael This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
pam Uh-huh.
michael As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
pam So you have an office and a workspace?
jan I do, I cannot create in the same space I conduct business, I'm sure that you're the same with your doodles. Smell.
jim It's fire.
jan Uh-huh, Bonfire.
michael Bond.
jan Men love this one.
michael James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. michael Scarn.
jan When I get frustrated, or irritated or. angry, I come up here and I just smell all my candles and it just -poof- goes away.
jim Just like that.
jan Just like that.
jan So this is the master bedroom, and these walls used to like white, like an asylum. So I wanted it to be softer, So I had it painted in eggshell white.
michael Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
jan Babe I thought you said you were going to tidy things up.
michael Well, I-
jan Shame on you.
pam What a cute bench.
michael Thanks, that's my bed. jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
jim Really? 'cause. seems pretty narrow. and short.
michael It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
jan See, he fits perfectly.
michael I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? Voila, right in the wall.
jim Wow.
michael Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
jim What is that chestnut?
michael No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
jan It's pine.
jim Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
jan Really?
pam Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.
michael If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
jan I bet you are.
jim Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
jan It was between the neon beer sign and the Dundies so I said "Honey keep the trophies. "
michael Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
jan Oh, excuse us just a second.
michael I'll get it.
jan So glad you're finally able to be here.
angela No, no.
michael Okay.
andy Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! These are for you.
jan Oh, how thoughtful.
michael Very nice.
andy Except for one flower, which is for. my flower.
jan Aw.
angela What am I supposed to do with this?
jan How 'bout we do the short tour and then I'll start dinner?
pam Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.
jan Oh no no no, it's just the osso buco needs to braise for about three hours, everything else is done.
pam Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4
 00?
jan You know Pam, in Spain they often don't start eating until midnight.
michael When in Rome.
jan Do you have a preference, upstairs first?
michael Whatever you say babe.
jan Follow me.
michael all right.
michael How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.
all Cheers.
michael Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
jim What was that?
jan So music, should we turn some music?
michael Yeah that sounds good.
jan Do you guys remember my old assistant Hunter? He is an excellent songwriter. Hunter's
cd You took me by the hand, Made me a man, That one night, You made everything all right, So raw, so right, all night, all right, Oh yeah, Oh yeah, So raw, so right, all night, all right, Oh yeah.
michael You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
jan Well I think he's probably just about as reliable as pam being that it usually takes you an afternoon to get back to me.
angela Sometimes I think she holds on to faxes.
pam I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for. at a dinner party.
andy No it's a. hump. There's a hump.
jan Joe Camel!
andy Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.
pam Montana.
jan Oh!
pam Joe Montana!
andy Yes! Yes.
pam Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?
michael all right, my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
jan Babe can you just like really, woah, could you just simmer down?
michae What, no, I'm just making people laugh.
jan No.
michael Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
jan I was watching Jim.
michael And he was laughing.
jan No smiling.
michael Look at him, he's laughing.
jim michael and jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. . push;
jim You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.
pam Oh okay.
michael Well you don't need two of you to do that.
jim That's true. Um. dinner sounded delicious. pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
pam Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
jim I don't know because I everything I own is there.
pam You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.
michael That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
andy Michael, you're up.
michael all right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. all right first name is Tom-
jan No no no, no names, no names, no rhyming, no soundalikes.
michael all right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
angela I don't know.
jim Katie Holmes.
michael No, Baah! But he's married to her!
jim Oh, Dawson's Creek.
michael No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
jan No rhyming!
jim Not really a rhyme.
angela Another clue, another clue.
michael Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
angela Those aren't helpful.
jim Tom Cruise!
michael No!
andy Time!
michael God, does anybody read the paper?!
pam Oh, thank you.
michael You're welcome.
jan I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here. The um, sliding glass door shattered. It's actually a really cute story. Do you wanna tell it babe or should I tell it?
michael I don't like that story babe.
jan Come on, it's a cute story, michael ran through the sliding glass doors because he thought he heard the ice cream truck!
michael Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
jan You are so right, you're so right because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges, and then I moved in and I cleaned it so I guess that makes me the Devil.
michael Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
angela You shouldn't joke about that.
pam Is there more wine in the kitchen?
jan I will get it, I will get it, what kind of hostess would I be if I didn't get. It's okay, I don't mind. In fact you know what, girl's trip, angela come on. Girl's trip.
jan Uh, not even close.
angela So you keep a very tidy house.
jan You should see our bathroom after michael takes a bath, whew. But I don't have to tell you Pam.
pam No, yeah. What?
jan Oh well don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
pam Oh, are you joking?
jan Well, michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
pam I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
angela I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
jan Mmhmm.
michael So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand . So jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
jim Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
michael Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10, 000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
andy Thought about it, I'm in.
jim I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
michael I'm sorry. What now?
jan Coming!
dwight Hello.
jan What are you doing here?
dwight We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
pam Awesome.
jan What is he doing here?
angela Yes, What are you doing here?
michael dwight is my friend.
woman We weren't invited?
michael You said that I could not invite dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. dwight brought glasses and a person.
jan Fine, whatever you want, just like always, whatever you want.
michael Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
jan We saw Wicked.
michael When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
jan I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world, okay? But look if you want to have kids, then fine you win. Let's have a ing kid.
michael Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
jan I hate my life.
dwight So can we come in?
dwight Hmmm. Mmm. great turkey leg.
jan I'm just gonna check on dinner.
dwight Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
angela I hate beet salad.
woman It's actually really good.
dwight Hey hey hey hey. I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
angela The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
michael Pam. I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
pam Like. like what?
michael I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. Hey, looks great babe.
andy Yeah it does.
pam I know jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?
jan Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
michael You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
jan Oops.
michael Excuse me for a second.
jim So. how do you guys know each other?
woman I was his babysitter.
pam And now you guys are dating?
dwight Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
jim Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions.
woman E-mail?
jim Nevermind.
michael Ok. alright. here we go. There. Oooookay.
jim That's nice.
michael Everybody enjoying their meal?
jan Hey babe?
michael Yeah?
jan How about we take the beer sign down until our guests leave and then we can discuss it.
michael No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
jan Ok.
michael jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
jan At least he's an artist.
michael BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
jan AND I'M A CANDLEMAKER BUT YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRAGGING ABOUT IT!
michael NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
jan FOR AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY!
michael MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
jan YOU BURN IT. YOU BUY IT!
michael OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
jan AND YOU'RE HARDLY MY FIRST!
michael THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
woman I'm gonna get going.
dwight Fine. Get outta here.
jim It's getting late.
michael You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
jim Of course
dwight Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers? officer 1
 Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?
michael Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party. officer 2
 The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
michael Oh. yes. There was some screaming but. um. my girlfriend. threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma. officer 1

michael Would she get into trouble?
officer Yes. She'd be charged.

jan Michael! Michael. What are you doing to him? officer 1

dwight michael can come home with me.
michael Jim? Pam?
