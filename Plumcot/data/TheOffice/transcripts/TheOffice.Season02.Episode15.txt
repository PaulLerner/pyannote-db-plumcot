jan_levinson So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.
pam_beesly Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.
jan_levinson Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...
michael_scott Hey, what's going on?
jan_levinson Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.
michael_scott Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
jan_levinson What are you doing?
michael_scott Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott They did this up in Albany...
jan_levinson You are not allowed in this session.
michael_scott And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
jan_levinson Now you're really not allowed in this session.
michael_scott Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...
jan_levinson I'm your boss.
michael_scott Anybody want any coffee or...
jan_levinson We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.
michael_scott Women in the workplace... yeah, translation "I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls." Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!
jan_levinson Ladies, I am so, so sorry. Can we start again? We were on such a roll. I... I... really apologize.
pam_beesly Jan.
jan_levinson Yes, Pam?
pam_beesly Michael's still at the door.
jan_levinson Michael!
jan_levinson So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?
dwight_schrute It's a terrible idea.
jim_halpert What is?
dwight_schrute Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
michael_scott Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!
michael_scott Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.
michael_scott Let's just clap. Ready? Yeah! Yeah!
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott That's what I'm talking about!
jan_levinson I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,
michael_scott Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
jan_levinson ... but it's very destructive.
michael_scott Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
jan_levinson Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?
michael_scott We have nowhere else Jan. This...
dwight_schrute We could do it in the warehouse.
jan_levinson Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.
michael_scott OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
michael_scott Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.
dwight_schrute Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
jan_levinson I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?
pam_beesly Mmmhmm.
jan_levinson Please? Thank you. very much.
michael_scott So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?
darryl_philbin My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.
michael_scott You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
roy_anderson Why?
michael_scott Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
roy_anderson I don't understand.
michael_scott Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
kevin_malone I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.
jim_halpert Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
kevin_malone I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.
michael_scott Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little "Good Will Hunting" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.
jan_levinson Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.
meredith_palmer Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.
jan_levinson Great. Phyllis?
phyllis_vance I'm good at computer stuff, emails, spreadsheets, all that.
angela_martin Really?
phyllis_vance I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...
jan_levinson No. Okay. Stop. Go on...
angela_martin I've seen some of your spreadsheets.
phyllis_vance Really? I thought they were pretty...
pam_beesly I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...
roy_anderson Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.
jim_halpert Oh, no, no. No.
roy_anderson No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?
jim_halpert Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
roy_anderson You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.
jim_halpert Yeah. I like talking to her too.
roy_anderson So, we're cool, right?
jim_halpert Yes. Yeah.
roy_anderson All right.
jim_halpert Yep. Cool, man.
roy_anderson Sweet.
kevin_malone
darryl_philbin Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.
michael_scott Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.
darryl_philbin The experience...
michael_scott Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
dwight_schrute Okay. Let's go. Step up.
michael_scott Check this out! Look at that! Look at that bwup-bwa! Hello! How are... Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.
meredith_palmer In five years, I'd like to be... five years sober.
jan_levinson That is an excellent goal.
meredith_palmer Four and a half.
kelly_kapoor I'll tell you one thing. I am not going to be one of those women schlepping her kids around in a minivan.
jan_levinson Great! Uh-huh?
kelly_kapoor I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.
Women#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode15
jan_levinson Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
dwight_schrute Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
jim_halpert Ponies.
dwight_schrute No.
ryan_howard How about rainbows?
dwight_schrute No.
jim_halpert Flowers.
darryl_philbin It's dangerous, Michael. Come on, get off this.
michael_scott Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.
darryl_philbin Mike.
michael_scott Stand clear.
darryl_philbin Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.
michael_scott I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
darryl_philbin Look, would ya... look.
michael_scott Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up.
darryl_philbin We're the ones that got to clean that up!
lonny Dammit, Michael!
michael_scott We ought to have this thing serviced.
michael_scott So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...
madge Hey, do you want me to go?
michael_scott No, why? Why would I... ? You could...
madge I'll go.
michael_scott Stay or...
phyllis_vance ...and a big walk-in closet.
meredith_palmer Oh, that's part of my dream too.
kelly_kapoor Oh, me too.
jan_levinson Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?
pam_beesly Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.
phyllis_vance She's real good.
pam_beesly Thanks.
jan_levinson You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.
pam_beesly Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...
jan_levinson Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.
pam_beesly Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...
jan_levinson There are always a million reasons not to do something.
michael_scott Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?
darryl_philbin My priority is safety.
michael_scott OK.
darryl_philbin So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.
michael_scott OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
darryl_philbin Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.
michael_scott I... That was just...
darryl_philbin That bothers me too.
michael_scott I was breathing.
roy_anderson Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.
michael_scott I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
lonny You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?
michael_scott OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
jan_levinson All right. Let's talk about clothing.
phyllis_vance I'm excited about today. I love girl talk.
jan_levinson Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.
angela_martin I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.
roy_anderson I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like "When are we going to go on a date-date?"
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode15 I hate that too!
darryl_philbin I hate that too.
kevin_malone That sucks so much.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode15 It totally sucks.
dwight_schrute Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas ain't free!"
lonny Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.
michael_scott I feel you.
darryl_philbin No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
dwight_schrute Not literally.
darryl_philbin You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.
michael_scott Yes.
darryl_philbin We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder
michael_scott Ah, you do. So...
darryl_philbin But we get paid a lot less.
dwight_schrute Word.
roy_anderson Like next to no benefits.
michael_scott I know. God! What is that?
roy_anderson Exactly.
michael_scott It blows. It blows, man. Gah...
darryl_philbin You know this would not happen if we had a union.
roy_anderson That's what I'm talking about.
michael_scott No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
roy_anderson Absolutely.
darryl_philbin That's what we need.
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode15 You know you're right.
darryl_philbin Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.
michael_scott You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
darryl_philbin It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?
roy_anderson In my truck.
michael_scott Dockworker's?
darryl_philbin Man, hook you up.
Men#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode15
Guy#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode15 Come on, man.
michael_scott Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
darryl_philbin Union! Union, yeah.
michael_scott The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
darryl_philbin Are you with us Mike?
michael_scott Yeah-es.
darryl_philbin Welcome to the warehouse.
all@ chant Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi...
jan_levinson Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...
michael_scott This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...
jan_levinson What? A union! What...
michael_scott Don't get hysterical.
jan_levinson I'm not...
michael_scott Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.
michael_scott Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?
jan_levinson The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?
michael_scott Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
jan_levinson You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.
michael_scott But we're bonding down there!
jan_levinson That's too bad.
michael_scott I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
jan_levinson I don't want to...
michael_scott Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
jan_levinson Michael! Michael! Michael!
michael_scott We have a history...
jan_levinson Michael.
michael_scott ...between us.
jan_levinson Don't say another word.
michael_scott I won't
jan_levinson Get yourself down stairs.
michael_scott I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
ryan_howard You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.
stanley_hudson This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.
jan_levinson Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...
phyllis_vance Mistake.
meredith_palmer Slip.
jan_levinson Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.
kelly_kapoor What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?
jan_levinson Excuse me?
kelly_kapoor I mean that's a baseball term, right?
jan_levinson I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.
kelly_kapoor ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.
jan_levinson Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.
kelly_kapoor He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey!
pam_beesly How's it going down there?
jim_halpert It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
pam_beesly Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.
jim_halpert Did you really?
pam_beesly No.
jim_halpert Oh.
pam_beesly Almost.
jim_halpert Good.
pam_beesly Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.
jim_halpert Nice. Well, what's it all about?
pam_beesly Um...
jim_halpert I think you should do it. That's great!
pam_beesly It's really cool.
michael_scott Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?
angela_martin Are you married?
jan_levinson I'm divorced.
phyllis_vance That must have been hard.
jan_levinson It was. Yes.
kelly_kapoor You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.
jan_levinson I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.
phyllis_vance Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.
angela_martin At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.
jan_levinson Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.
kelly_kapoor How can someone so beautiful be so sad?
michael_scott Hi.
jan_levinson Did you take care of the situation?
michael_scott Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
jan_levinson Excuse me.
michael_scott I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...
jan_levinson Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.
pam_beesly Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.
jim_halpert So you're not doing it.
pam_beesly How did you know?
jim_halpert Why not?
pam_beesly Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.
jim_halpert Come on.
pam_beesly Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.
jim_halpert Roy said that.
pam_beesly What? You have something you want to say?
jim_halpert You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
pam_beesly Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!
jim_halpert You are?
pam_beesly Yeah.
pam_beesly It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .
michael_scott I'm just going to put this over there.
darryl_philbin This is not a good idea right here.
michael_scott You did uh... okay.
michael_scott Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?
michael_scott Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.
all@ the Men Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.
michael_scott Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
michael_scott Thank you to our hosts.
darryl_philbin Hey Michael. This ain't over.
michael_scott Ahhh! Excellent.
michael_scott Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.
