dwight Where is my desk?
jim That is weird.
dwight This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.
jim Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.
dwight I didn't lose my desk.
jim Okay, calm down. Where was the last place you saw it?
dwight Okay, who moved my desk?
jim I think you should retrace your steps.
dwight Ok, I am going to tell michael and this entire office will be punished!
jim Colder. warmer. little warmer. there you go, ooh, warmer. warmer. warmer. warmer. warmer . cold, cold, cold, back up. ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot.
dwight dwight Schrute.
jim Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
dwight Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
jim I know.
dwight It's by the ream?
jim Uh, yeah, ream.
dwight . now, $9. 78, signs and discounts 7%.
jim Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
dwight Wash your hands, Kevin.
jim Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second.
dwight Sensei, hello it's Sempai.
jim Umm.
dwight Dwight.
jim You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.
dwight Yes, I just had a ques-. Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
jim Was that your mom?
dwight No, that was my Sensei.
jim Oh, I thought it was your mom.
dwight I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
jim Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
dwight Assistant Sensei.
jim Ok.
dwight I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
stanley I don't want to stay until seven again this year.
pam I don't really have any control over that Stanley.
pam michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.
michael I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.
ryan Did you ask me here for any specific reason?
michael Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
ryan Why is that secret?
michael Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
pam Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.
michael Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
pam It's just last year you.
michael Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
pam Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.
michael Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
ryan Updating emergency contacts.
pam Well, is that really a priority?
michael Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because pam said it wasn't a priority. " Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
ryan Catch-22.
michael Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?
jim Uh, Larissa Halpert.
ryan What's her address?
jim 117 Mount Bergin St.
ryan Hello?
michael Hey Ryan. This is michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
ryan Do you mean Neverland?
michael This is Tito.
ryan What?
michael Calling from.
pam You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.
jim You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
pam I am just following the website.
jim Well, at least I don't have cavities.
pam Yes, you have very nice teeth.
jim Thanks.
ryan Who is your emergency contact?
kevin Stacy.
ryan 
michael Pick up.
ryan Hello?
michael This is Mike Tyson.
jim Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
dwight Impossible. The way they're programmed. You're mocking me.
jim No I'm not.
dwight Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
jim Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is
this umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it.
dwight Ok, give that back to me.
jim Ok, say please.
dwight No. That is not a toy.
jim Please?
dwight Please?
jim Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
dwight Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
michael And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
pam Could you practice on the forms?
dwight No women or children, unless provoked.
jim Ok, Roy?
dwight Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
jim Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
michael Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
dwight Because we're friends.
michael Because I would kick his ass.
jim Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so.
michael So? I've beaten up black belts.
jim Uh, how did you know they were black belts?
michael They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.
ryan Is your wife still your contact?
toby Um, ex-wife. Yeah. Um, her last name is 'Becker' now.
ryan 'Kay.
toby You don't need to write 'ex'.
michael And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.
jim Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way, right?
michael You were a Jet?
angela Have you signed the expense reports yet?
michael Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
dwight Argggg!
michael I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.
michael Just hit me. You'll see.
jim I can't. I just got a manicure.
michael Oh, queer. eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
jim Just have dwight punch you.
michael Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
jim You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
dwight What belt are they?
michael Look, dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'.
dwight No!
michael . he cried at the end of it. He did.
dwight Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
michael Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
dwight Ok, I'll punch you.
michael Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
dwight Kiyah!
michael Fuuuaaaahhhhh. oohhhhh! . push;
dwight Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
jim Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
michael Yeah. Thank you.
dwight I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
jim Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.
pam I don't know.
jim Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.
pam French Onion?
jim Obviously.
pam Ok.
jim Yes.
dwight Take this pen and stab me with it.
michael Go away.
pam I just have a quick question.
michael I haven't signed them, ok?
pam No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?
michael Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.
pam He's a purple belt. That's really high.
michael Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
pam It's just out there, you.
michael Oh, so that's what they are saying?
pam Yeah.
michael Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
jim Uh, Kitchen.
michael Ok.
kelly Hi-yah!
dwight Good.
kelly Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
dwight Now watch, let me take you from behind.
kelly What?
michael Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
dwight I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
michael No, Really?
dwight In case you remember, I was defending my honor. like a samurai.
michael Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
dwight Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
michael Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two
punches me punching you and you hitting the floor.
dwight No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
michael Really?
dwight Yeah.
michael You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
jim Ooh, what about, uh, Dwight's dojo?
michael No, they must have class.
dwight No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
michael Look.
dwight I've got the key.
toby Michael.
michael Hey, Toby.
toby Any word on those time cards?
michael I've got an
idea why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
jim Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight. Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight.
michael I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.
ira Uh, no, it's not.
michael I think it is. A guy told me about that.
ira Actually, it's a symbol for eternal discipline.
michael Oh.
jim Wow, that is really interesting.
pam What?
jim Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.
pam Well, look closer.
jim Oh, ok.
pam Once point for me.
jim Tied up.
pam Oh, you're dead.
jim What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.
pam Hey, put me down. Put me down. Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey.
ira Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?
dwight Yes, Sensei!
michael Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
ira Shi mate!
dwight Hiii!
michael Hey!
ira Alright, break.
michael What the hell was that?
dwight Yes!
ira dwight - awarded a point.
michael No.
dwight Eat it!
michael Alright, that's the way you want it.
dwight Two more.
michael Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
kevin Sweep the leg.
michael I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
dwight No.
michael I got his pants.
dwight It was my pants.
ira No points for pants.
michael Dwight, you have. No, you have something. God, you look like such an idiot!
ira Clean single kick, gentlemen.
michael Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
ira Ok, break. Break.
dwight No holding.
michael You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. Eight points. Nine points.
dwight No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
michael Open your mouth.
dwight No, Michael!
michael You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? "Raging Bull. " Pacino. Oh, I want that footage. I want it. I need it. Ah, I have to get back to work. I have lots of work. Oh, oh check this out. Come here. There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. Oh, we're playing phone tag. Ryan's
voicemail Seven new messages. First New Message. "Hi, Ryan. This is Saddam Hussein. " Next new message. "Hi, Ryan. This is your girlfriend. and I'm mad!"
michael My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?
ryan Fudge?
michael Yeah. uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
dwight I need to change my emergency contact information from michael Scott.
ryan Ok, to what?
dwight Just put "The Hospital. " Contact
number just put 9-1-1.
michael He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
kevin Later Jim.
jim Later, Kev. Have a good weekend.
pam Yeah, you too.
michael Yeah.
ryan I have the emergency contacts.
michael Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
ryan Uh, hanging out with some friends, probably.
michael If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
ryan Yeah, alright, I'll um, see you Monday.
michael Alright, bye.
michael Dwight?
angela Michael, did you finish yet?
michael This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
dwight I'm busy.
michael Well, busier. Making the time.
stanley Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
toby We want to go home.
michael Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
pam The shipping place closes in a half hour.
michael I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
angela This is illegal.
stanley I don't care.
michael I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
dwight Of course.
michael And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
dwight Michael, I don't know.
michael I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
dwight I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
michael No, no, title change only.
dwight I'll have pam send out a memo.
michael No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
dwight Just a formality.
michael Absolutely but not really.
dwight Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
michael Yes you do.
dwight Thank you, Sensei.
michael And, ditto.
michael I told dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
