kevin_malone Uh oh. She's doing it again.
pam_beesly Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey. Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
clark It's p0rn.
pam_beesly Yeah.
dwight_schrute Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
phyllis_vance Why?
darryl_philbin Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
pam_beesly Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
meredith_palmer Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
all@ Ugh. Ew.
andy_bernard What?
dwight_schrute Phyllis is m*st*rb*t*ng. In the office right now as we speak.
angela_martin Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
toby_flenderson He- he can't do that. Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal. It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
all@ No!
oscar_martinez Toby, how do you propose that we-
andy_bernard Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
pam_beesly She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
andy_bernard Well there you go. That's muy caliente.
dwight_schrute OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this.
phyllis_vance What the hell?!
dwight_schrute It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.
andy_bernard Excuse me, dirty birdie
phyllis_vance Wait, what?
andy_bernard You can have this back at the end of the day. Oh!!
dwight_schrute Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
clark What's her name?
dwight_schrute Esther Ruger.
clark Sweet.
dwight_schrute Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
clark Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
dwight_schrute Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
clark Oh.
dwight_schrute What do you think?
clark The same thing that you think.
dwight_schrute A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
clark God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
angela_martin Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
angela_martin Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther. She's coming here this afternoon with her father. Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart!
pam_beesly Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
jim_halpert Oh man.
pam_beesly I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
jim_halpert Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
pam_beesly Um.
jim_halpert What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
pam_beesly You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
jim_halpert Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
pam_beesly Oh, oh OK.
jim_halpert Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
pam_beesly Um, Ok. Well?
jim_halpert Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
pam_beesly Yeah, sounds good. Ok.
jim_halpert Ok great.
pam_beesly Ok.
jim_halpert Bye.
pam_beesly Bye.
kevin_malone What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
oscar_martinez There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
phyllis_vance Play it again.
Promo#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode18 Voice The boss. The workers. The lives. The loves. The people. The paper. The Office An American Workplace. Coming soon on WVIA.
kevin_malone Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
kevin_malone This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
kevin_malone Did you see this?
angela_martin Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
clark Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
pam_beesly Uh huh.
clark Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? Yikes. That is awful.
pam_beesly It wasn't so bad.
andy_bernard Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. "Banjo at 0 19 is aight" Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy. I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
jim_halpert Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.
tractor_salesman Howard Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh.
darryl_philbin Hey, man. Darryl.
tractor_salesman Howard Hey there, Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. Eat Fresh.
jim_halpert Let's go to the conference room.
dwight_schrute Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
angela_martin I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
dwight_schrute Did I tell you about her teeth?
erin_hannon Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
angela_martin Yes.
dwight_schrute Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
mr_bruegger Ruger Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.
dwight_schrute Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
esther Thank you.
angela_martin I guess men find Esther attractive. I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
pam_beesly Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
stanley_hudson We've all changed.
jim_halpert With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
darryl_philbin And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
tractor_salesman Howard I look at these actors on TV and I think "C'mon, I can do that."
jim_halpert Right?
tractor_salesman Howard Watch this Eat Fresh. Now what does that make you think of?
darryl_philbin Subway sandwiches.
jim_halpert Yep.
tractor_salesman Howard How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext.
jim_halpert Wow.
tractor_salesman Howard I actually wrote a screenplay, it's called "The Big Piece"
jim_halpert Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
tractor_salesman Howard Half biopic and half superhero movie. A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard-
jim_halpert OK
tractor_salesman Howard -hits a home run into outer space. Ball comes back with space dust on it, which transforms him into The Big Piece.
darryl_philbin The space dust does it.
jim_halpert Space dust.
darryl_philbin Yeah.
tractor_salesman Howard I actually brought a- some copies of my script if you guys wanna read it together.
jim_halpert Sure, yeah. Hollywood. Alright.
darryl_philbin Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
jim_halpert Ok, great.
kevin_malone Andy, are there documentary groupies?
andy_bernard Of course there are!
kevin_malone Of course.
toby_flenderson A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
nellie_bertram Oh, I don't care.
oscar_martinez Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
pam_beesly Oh my god!
Promo#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode18 Announcer
kevin_malone What was that word they said when they showed me "Skrald mand"? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy?
oscar_martinez Dumpster Man.
kevin_malone Cool. Superhero.
angela_martin What about me? "Klokken tre pige"
oscar_martinez "Three PM Girl"
angela_martin What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
oscar_martinez It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
phyllis_vance Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
angela_martin Oh my god.
angela_martin There was much more secret filming than I expected. But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
oscar_martinez Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
meredith_palmer I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? Boob sauce!
all@ No!
oscar_martinez Meredith!
angela_martin Come on!
nellie_bertram Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
oscar_martinez Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
erin_hannon Hey.
angela_martin Oscar.
oscar_martinez I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
oscar_martinez I have been very honest with you guys. In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine. You're not going to use any of that, are you?
andy_bernard People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says "You guys are killing it!" I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
angela_martin I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
stanley_hudson Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea.
oscar_martinez Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
angela_martin We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
erin_hannon I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar. Did they film that?
nellie_bertram My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
pete_miller Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
pam_beesly Brian?
pete_miller Yeah.
pam_beesly Yeah, I guess I could.
stanley_hudson Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
phyllis_vance I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
stanley_hudson She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
all@ Oh!
meredith_palmer Wow.
clark Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
Ruger#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode18 Sister 1 That manipulates the secondary shaft.
clark Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga!
Salesmen#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode18 The lift capacity's up at two thousand pounds. That's a lot of beets.
mr_bruegger Ruger Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns.
dwight_schrute Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
mr_bruegger Ruger Esther, get in the truck.
dwight_schrute Ok ok ok, wait! You win.
colin_athlead_employee Let's get the paperwork started.
Ruger#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode18 Sister 2 We should buy an auger together.
clark Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Ruger#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode18 Sister 1 You would be a great one to buy an auger with.
stanley_hudson Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
andy_bernard Oh! Seven new comments. "The guy at 0 19 is hawt!" "Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0 19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!" "He's not hawt, he's gay." "Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again." "He is hawt!" See, thank you, that's more like it. "He is butt." God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
dwight_schrute Security deposit. That's been-
mr_bruegger Ruger Standard.
dwight_schrute Right, standard.
clark Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
dwight_schrute No.
clark One second.
dwight_schrute No.
clark One second.
dwight_schrute I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
clark Don't do it.
dwight_schrute What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
clark Dude, we're being conned.
dwight_schrute Go on.
clark These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
dwight_schrute No.
clark Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
dwight_schrute What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
clark I don't even know what an auger is!
dwight_schrute No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
mr_bruegger Ruger Hey, you ready to sign?
dwight_schrute I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.
brian Oh, hey!
pam_beesly Hey!
brian Hi.
pam_beesly Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
brian No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
pam_beesly Oh my gosh, please, don't.

brian Alright, that's for you.
pam_beesly Oh, thank you.
brian Cheers.
pam_beesly Cheers.
angela_martin Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
oscar_martinez They caught us kissing on Halloween.
angela_martin Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan!
oscar_martinez Oh!
angela_martin God!
oscar_martinez Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
angela_martin Oh! Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
oscar_martinez Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
angela_martin Call him!
oscar_martinez You call him!
angela_martin Call him!
oscar_martinez Stop hitting me!
angela_martin Call him! Call him!

brian So...
pam_beesly So..
brian What brings you by?
pam_beesly Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
brian Oh yeah, that's right.
pam_beesly Yeah. It's kinda crazy.
brian Yeah, it is.
pam_beesly See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
brian Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
pam_beesly Yeah, wasn't that neat?
brian Yeah, it was cool.
pam_beesly Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
brian Um...
pam_beesly I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
brian No no, it's-
pam_beesly I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
brian No, you're not crazy.
pam_beesly Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
brian Yeah.
pam_beesly You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
brian They want to know how much what?
pam_beesly How much stuff you got.
brian Pretty much everything.
pam_beesly Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
brian They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
pam_beesly So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
brian That's not really true, I mean-
pam_beesly Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.
brian Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
pam_beesly No I think you explained it.
brian Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- Pam.
jim_halpert "Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh."
tractor_salesman Howard That'll pay for the exploding helicopter.
jim_halpert Smart.
tractor_salesman Howard "Suddenly, the evil thugs break in to the stadium. The Big Piece hits baseballs at the evil thugs."
jim_halpert "Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks."
tractor_salesman Howard Come on man, sell it!
darryl_philbin Yeah, Jim.
jim_halpert "Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!"
tractor_salesman Howard Yeah, that's better. A bunch of hot women go "Oh yeah!"
jim_halpert "Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you."
tractor_salesman Howard "They kiss. It is super emotional. Like in Toy Story."
jim_halpert Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
darryl_philbin It's so strong.
tractor_salesman Howard Keep reading then.
jim_halpert "Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack."
tractor_salesman Howard Um another thing. I'm gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader.
jim_halpert I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
darryl_philbin We can look into it.
jim_halpert We'll look into it.
tractor_salesman Howard We need Darth.
jim_halpert We gotta get him.
darryl_philbin We'll go after Darth then.
jim_halpert We're gonna go get him.
darryl_philbin That's what we gotta do.
jim_halpert We're gonna get him.
dwight_schrute Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
clark A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
dwight_schrute Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
clark Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
dwight_schrute By hand.
esther Dwight, we need to talk.
dwight_schrute I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
esther Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends.
dwight_schrute No.
esther So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back.
dwight_schrute That snake!
esther You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine.
dwight_schrute That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
esther Mmhm.
dwight_schrute So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
esther Of course. You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you?
dwight_schrute No!
clark Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?
dwight_schrute Post hole digging.
esther Stupid.
edna You've reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message.
