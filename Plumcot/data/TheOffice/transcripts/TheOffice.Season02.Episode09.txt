michael_scott It is Friday morning and it is another beautiful day in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Oh my God. Ohhh. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Oh, we have a serious problem here. Alright everybody, lock the doors, turn off the lights. Pretend you're not here.
jim_halpert Are we in danger?
michael_scott There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody.
kevin_malone Michael, should I call the... What?
michael_scott The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.
michael_scott Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...
sadiq That just means you have to enter your password.
michael_scott Oh...
sadiq What's your password, Michael?
michael_scott Oh, umm...
sadiq Oh, it's 1-2-3.
michael_scott Yes.
dwight_schrute Mi-
michael_scott AH! Guh-oood.
dwight_schrute Sorry.
michael_scott Please don't do that.
dwight_schrute Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?
michael_scott I can't tell you.
dwight_schrute You have to tell me.
michael_scott I don't have to tell you anything.
dwight_schrute Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
michael_scott Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. Brrr! That's strong!
dwight_schrute Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
michael_scott I'm not going get a brain-
dwight_schrute Or get hit by a car-
michael_scott Stop it.
dwight_schrute Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
michael_scott Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go... away?
michael_scott There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees. His salary, that would depress them. His bed, it--- And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.
michael_scott So how do you search?
sadiq By keyword phrase.
michael_scott Try "profits". No! Try "Michael Scott". "Michael" "boss" and "funny". Oh my God, wow! E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy. "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers.
oscar_martinez Hey, what's the deal, Michael? Why are you spying on our computers?
michael_scott Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot? I will destroy everything in my path-
oscar_martinez Actually, it's just-
michael_scott Beep! Bop!
oscar_martinez Ok...
michael_scott Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk. Oil can. Oil can.
oscar_martinez Tin Man. Actually we just a got a memo from IT saying you're doing e-mail surveillance.
michael_scott Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
dwight_schrute So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?
michael_scott You know what the problem is?
stanley_hudson I think I do.
michael_scott The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
kevin_malone I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.
dwight_schrute Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
angela_martin I know.
dwight_schrute Good.
pam_beesly Hey. Something just happened. Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly I know!
jim_halpert Hmm...
pam_beesly Do you think that they're like-
jim_halpert No.
pam_beesly No, right, no, no.
jim_halpert
pam_beesly Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?
pam_beesly It's like squishing a spider under a book. It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead. Sooo... If you guys see anything... ?
pam_beesly Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
dwight_schrute Nice.
pam_beesly One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?
dwight_schrute Does he have access to their medical records?
pam_beesly Ummmm...
dwight_schrute I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
michael_scott Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No.
pam_beesly Hey, Angela-
angela_martin Hi.
pam_beesly How's it going?
angela_martin It's ok.
pam_beesly Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?
angela_martin No. Are we supposed to?
pam_beesly No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.
angela_martin Hmm... Excuse me.
pam_beesly Oh.
michael_scott There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.
kevin_malone That's pretty young.
pam_beesly Yeah.
kevin_malone Are you gonna eat with us?
michael_scott Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup.
jim_halpert Uh hum.
michael_scott Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
pam_beesly The professors would go to the parties?
michael_scott Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.
jim_halpert It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up. He is very real.
pam_beesly What? Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!
dwight_schrute Question on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
jim_halpert Oh, uh, no. Could-
dwight_schrute I was wondering-
jim_halpert Could, keep that down.
dwight_schrute Why?
jim_halpert Because not everybody knows about the party.
dwight_schrute Like who? Who doesn't know?
jim_halpert Umm, Michael.
dwight_schrute Why just Michael?
jim_halpert Because it's a surprise.
dwight_schrute Is it?
jim_halpert Uh hmm.
dwight_schrute Oh, that's perfect!
jim_halpert So, don't tell.
dwight_schrute I won't.
jim_halpert Ok.
jim_halpert So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.
pam_beesly Really? That's great.
jim_halpert I know.
pam_beesly Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.
jim_halpert Oh man. Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff. So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
pam_beesly Oh, no, he can't make it.
jim_halpert Oh, ok, cool.
michael_scott Hey there.
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott Almost quittin' time.
jim_halpert Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
michael_scott One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
jim_halpert Oh, um... .I can't.
michael_scott You have plans.
jim_halpert Uh hmm, definitely.
michael_scott I do, too. I do, too.
jim_halpert You do?
michael_scott I do, yeah. Big plans.
jim_halpert Because you said "do you wanna hang out"-
michael_scott Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
jim_halpert Really?
michael_scott Yeah.
jim_halpert Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
michael_scott It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
jim_halpert Improv sounds great.
michael_scott It is. Ok.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert I think Stanley just coughed.
michael_scott Hey, Pam. Do you need me to walk to your vehicular transport?
pam_beesly No thanks.
michael_scott Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
oscar_martinez I'm on a call.
michael_scott Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to?
kevin_malone My brother is in town and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at the Scien-
michael_scott Ok, alright.
kevin_malone Oh.
michael_scott Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to?
angela_martin I'm just leaving for the day.
michael_scott Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed?
angela_martin Charity. Bake drive.
michael_scott Liar!
angela_martin No!
michael_scott You are a liar.
angela_martin No, I'm not.
michael_scott Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
dwight_schrute Battlestar Galatica.
michael_scott That's, whatever stupid show you want-
dwight_schrute I can't-
michael_scott To watch tonight
dwight_schrute Tonight.
michael_scott We're watching it.
dwight_schrute Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice.
michael_scott I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Clarinet.
michael_scott You, too, Dwight?
dwight_schrute Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. He has no idea!
jim_halpert Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
dwight_schrute Jim! You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
mark Hey, you must be Dwight!
dwight_schrute You don't work with us.
jim_halpert That's because Mark's my roommate.
mark Hey, I love the Birkenstocks.
dwight_schrute Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here.
jim_halpert Uh hmm.
dwight_schrute When is the guest of honor coming?
jim_halpert Oh, uh, later-ish.
dwight_schrute He's gonna love it!
jim_halpert Great. Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey! Just in time! You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
pam_beesly Definitely.
jim_halpert Well, the group tour is now leaving, then. Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows. I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
ryan_howard Hey, is Katy coming?
jim_halpert Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
ryan_howard Huh, is it ok if I call her?

michael_scott Think about this; what is the most exciting thing that can happen, on TV, or in movies, or in real life? Somebody has a gun. That's why I always start with a gun, because you can't top it, you just can't.

michael_scott Nothing.
stephanie Teacher Then why are his hands up? Bill?
bill He told me he couldn't show it to me, but he has a gun.
stephanie Teacher Ok, let's call it a day. Nice job, Bill.
michael_scott Good, it's good. Good work, everybody.
jim_halpert Angela, burger? Dog? Havin' fun?
angela_martin I got sap on me.
jim_halpert Chicken, hot dog, burger.
angela_martin I'm a vegetarian.
jim_halpert There is soda inside.
angela_martin Guh.
stanley_hudson I didn't think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did.
oscar_martinez Yeah, it surprised us all. I'll tell you why. Because when they---
kelly_kapoor I'm sorry guys; can we please not talk about paper? There's gotta be something else we can talk about.
angela_martin I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine.
pam_beesly Hey Phyllis, come here for a second.
phyllis_vance Sure.
pam_beesly Have you heard anything about any secret office romances?
phyllis_vance You tell me. Well, you do mean you and Jim right? Oh God. I am so sorry, I thought, you guys hang out all the time and you're talking all the time. I'm sorry!
pam_beesly That's ok. It's ok.
kevin_malone Not so fast... Fire Guy.
marybeth How do I get to Bernie's Tavern from here?
bill Oh, don't worry. We're all gonna carpool.
michael_scott So Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's? Go to Bernie's?
bill Oh sorry, we're not going as a group, it's just a private friend who just happens to know all of us from different ways is throwing a private birthday thing.
michael_scott Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it.
bill Ok.
michael_scott Ok, see you later. Nice job, Bill. Not.
phyllis_vance Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known...
jim_halpert Oh by the way how's your side project going?
pam_beesly Oh, yeah I gave that up.
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
pam_beesly Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.
kevin_malone Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
dwight_schrute Surprise! Everybody!
phyllis_vance Dwight...
michael_scott Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in. There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it. Here ya go Temp, take my jacket! Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine?
michael_scott Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---
michael_scott and Jim It requires a dedication, all this love we feel needs no conversation. Divided, together, uh huh. Making love with each other, uh huh.
michael_scott We're making love!
michael_scott and Jim Islands in the stream, that is what we are, no one in between, how can we be wrong? Sail away with me...
michael_scott Talk! Just talk!
marybeth I am-
michael_scott Shut up!
michael_scott Funny story the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says "Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt." And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.
