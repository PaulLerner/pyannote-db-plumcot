angela Are you swallowing them whole? You're eating them so fast, are they even touching your tongue?
kevin Yes.
dwight Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
jim So why did you come in here?
dwight To socialize. And inform.
michael Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
ryan You're taking two?
kelly Yeah, um, but one of them is for Toby.
michael Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
kelly Um, I'm just gonna hand it to him right now.
michael Heh, okay, weirdo.
jim Why is that, why is that weird?
michael She said she was going to give it to him right now.
jim She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
michael Yeah, they used to.
jim toby works here again.
michael Oh, can you imagine?
jim Oh no.
michael Uhhgh.
jim You don't know.
michael I don't know. What?
jim You should probably just meander back there; take a look. See if he's, see if he's back.
michael Hmmm, dare I? You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake. Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex.
toby Hi, Micha-
michael NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
michael Look at him. With his stupid face. Stupid. tan. No.
dwight He looks great.
michael No.
dwight Well rested.
michael He looks worse.
david Michael, is everyone okay?
michael Uh, well I'm afraid not. toby Flenderson, of H. R, has made a sudden reappearance.
david I don't understand, is anyone hurt?
michael Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
david Michael, you texted me, 911 CALL ME.
michael Yes.
david All in caps. Do you know what 911 means?
michael I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls. Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.
david Now what I'm curious about is how you were able to go an entire a week without knowing a member of your staff was there.
michael I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
dwight Also, it's icky back there.
michael That's true. People say it's icky.
david Okay, I have to go.
michael David, wait.
david No.
michael Is there no way we can get rid of him?
david Not without cause, Michael.
michael I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.
david You have to get along with Toby.
michael No.
david Yep.
michael I don't.
david Goodbye, Michael.
michael Don't do that.
pam Oh, come on! Do you see this? Disgusting.
andy So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?
jim Yeah, I am. Wait, how do you know that? I didn't tell you that.
andy Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk. I saw some email. I got peepers of an eagle.
jim That's really not cool.
andy Kaaw!
kevin So Jim, you're gonna live in the same house that you used to pee the bed in?
jim Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
jim Today's a big day. Today's the day that I show pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom. It's got shag carpets. I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's. And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. She's gonna love it. Right?
jim Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?
andy Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle? You're in for a spanking my friend. Myself and my lady? - no secrets.
phyllis Jim, don't listen to Andy. I think it's so romantic.
jim Oh thanks, Phyllis.
phyllis Where's your place?
jim Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave? By the quarry?
phyllis Ohhh.
creed Cool beans, man, I live by the quarry. We should hang out by the quarry and throw things down there.
jim Definitely we should.
oscar "To whoever made the microwave
mess the microwave is a shared kitchen appliance. By not cleaning it up you are basically telling whoever follows that their time is less valuable, as they will have to scrub out your disgusting splatter. Sincerely, disappointed. "
andy That is just obnoxious.
oscar No kidding.
pam Yeah. Wait, what, the mess or the note?
oscar The note. So "holier than thou".
angela Hmm, I liked it.
pam Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?
andy No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.
meredith Sincerely, disappointed? Get off your high horse, Richie.
pam Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.
meredith Yeh, they're rich.
michael You want to see some really high caliber acting? Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. Hey Toby, great to have you back, man. Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.
toby Well thanks Michael.
michael You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.
toby Well that's sweet, I missed you guys too.
michael So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.
toby Well, um, it was amazing. It really was, thanks for asking. Um the beaches were pristine.
michael Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
toby . and, yeah, the whole thing was incredibly cathartic.
michael Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?
toby It was actually kind of hard to meet people I found.
michael I bet, for you.
toby And uh, yeah, plus it was hot.
michael Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
toby Are you all right, Michael?
michael Yeah, I am. I am.
michael I tried, I tried. I tried to talk to toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil. snail. I feel like I'm dying inside. I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II. She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends. I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.
michael Okay, just summarize.
dwight Okay, fireable offenses
include workplace violence and sexual harassment.
michael That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
dwight I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.
michael Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.
dwight Okay
michael What are you doing?
dwight I am the bait.
michael For what?
dwight Men find me desirable.
michael No, no, no.
dwight Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
michael You're the bait for Toby?
dwight Mmhmm.
michael No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.
dwight Men find me desirable.
michael Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
pam When it comes down to it, it's a health issue. I should have written that.
jim Mmhmm, yeah.
pam Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?
jim Oh totally. Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
pam Are you inching away from me?
jim No.
pam Reach your arms out.
jim I'm always this close.
michael Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. jim may I have a moment with pam please.
jim Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so.
michael Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
pam What do you need, Michael?
michael Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?
michael Good. N-no no no, don't.
pam "Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle. I'm too shy to tell you that I love you. "
michael Pam. Pam, you gave me your word.
ryan You did that for me?
kelly Mmhmm.
ryan Are you happy you did?
toby Hey guys that's really inappropriate.
ryan What's up?
michael Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
ryan Yeah, yeah I'll see them.
michael toby can I see those? Ooh. What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?
dwight Those are fighting words.
michael You mad? You mad at me?
dwight I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
michael Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
dwight Hmmm?
michael Huh? He might do it.
kelly Punch him, Toby!
michael I dare you to. Come on.
dwight Come on. Baaah!
michael What's the matter. haaaww!
dwight Hit him! Hit him, Chicken.
ryan Yeah, punch him.
michael Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
dwight Ryan. Come on, man?
michael No do it, do it. I dare you.
dwight Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
michael Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon.
toby I'm not going to punch you, Michael.
dwight Are you really not going to punch him?
toby No, why would I punch you?
michael Son of a bitch.
ryan You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man. . push;
dwight I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
michael Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.
dwight There's still one thing we could do to get toby fired.
michael What's that?
dwight Frame him, for using drugs.
michael Frame him?
dwight Yeah, it's illegal, but. everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
michael I've never framed a man before, have you?
dwight Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
michael Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
michael Hello. I've seen you guys around. I'm michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. How you doing? Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here? I need to purchase something. Vance Refrigeration
guy A fridge?
michael No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some. Vance Refrigeration
guy What?
michael Grass, weed?
leo What makes you think we'd have weed?
michael I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt. Vance Refrigeration
guy Hey, just hold on one second.
michael I'm not wearing a wire, so.
leo Why would you even say that? Vance Refrigeration
guy Hey, that's gonna be 500 dollars.
michael How much? How many pounds is it? Vance Refrigeration
guy It's- it's two pounds. I'm losing money on this man just, give me the money. Alright, walk away.
leo Walk away. Vance Refrigeration
guy Walk away.
ryan Hey, Pam? I just wanted to let you know; I'm totally on your side with the whole microwave situation.
pam Thank you.
ryan I was just back there, to make some cup-o-soup; the thing is still a huge mess.
pam I know, can you believe it?
ryan Yeah, it's crazy. But, I guess the thing is at some point, notes or no notes, someone's gonna have to just get there and clean it up.
pam I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?
ryan Ah ha ha, oh no, trust me. I would just make it worse.
pam How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?
ryan I--- I would find a way.
pam You've seen things cleaned before though, right?
ryan I--- Pam, I am hopeless at that stuff I. I, uh.
kelly Hi, Michael.
michael Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot. I forgot.
dwight Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is toby Flenderson and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon. Police Officer 1
 Hi, we received a call?
pam I don't know anything about that. Police Officer 1
 We were tipped off about a possible narcotics situation.

dwight Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
toby Hey, what is this?
dwight Search his things. Police Officer 2
 Sir, can you step away from your desk please?
toby Why? Police Officer 2
 Sir, please step away from your desk.
toby Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this.
dwight They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
toby Hey, hey what are- why are you doing this?
michael Uh, you know what? I think that this. uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
toby Don't search my stuff. Police Officer 1
 Sir?
toby I have a reasonable right to privacy.
dwight Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
toby Michael!
michael Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay? Police Officer 1
 Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?
toby Oh my God!
michael No, no no no. No, no.
toby That was. I went to Costa Rica for a few months. What is going on?
michael No, that was. that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate. Police Officer 1

toby That is not mine. I have never seen that before.
michael No, no no no no. Police Officer 1
 Turn around.

dwight So wait a minute, there's no drugs? Police Officer 2
 No.
dwight Gahh, dammit! Come on! Police Officer 1
 We got a fake tip.
dwight Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him? Police Officer 1
 No.
dwight You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?
michael You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
toby I didn't put caprese salad in my drawer, Michael.
michael Hmm.
toby Did you?
michael Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad. anywhere.
toby You know but the police could have been out there you know, catching real criminals instead of here searching my stuff.
michael Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're. you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
michael You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us. So.
toby I did leave.
michael Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of. history.
toby Well, I don't see it that way.
michael Do you want to hear a lie?
toby What?
michael I think you're great. You're my best friend.
ryan I can't do this.
kelly Can't do what?
ryan It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me.
kelly Wait, what are you saying? I broke up with Darryl so I could be with you.
ryan That was your choice; don't put that on me. I'm just going on a little trip.
kelly Oh, can I come?
ryan It's not that kind of trip. I'm going to Thailand with some friends from high school, well, a high school. And if I don't do it now I'll never get to go. And I'll always resent you for it. you don't want me to resent you, do you?
kelly So you're dumping me?
ryan Let's be adults about this. Let's have s*x one more time. And if you have any extra cash, that would be amazing.
kelly Okay?
jim Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?
pam Sure.
jim Cool.
pam What are we doing at your parent's house?
jim I have a surprise for you. All right, ready? Close your eyes and now open your eyes. Tadah!
pam I don't get it.
jim I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so.
jim So I'm still in the process of converting the garage. It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect for an art studio. Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that. And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---
pam I love it.
jim You do?
pam Yeah, I love it!
jim Really?
pam I mean, you bought me a house!
jim Oh my God.
pam You bought me a house!
jim Yeah, I did.
pam Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?
jim No, No, we'll just board that up. It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
pam And the clown?
jim Yeah, I can't. really can't move him.
dwight What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets
interesting I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.
