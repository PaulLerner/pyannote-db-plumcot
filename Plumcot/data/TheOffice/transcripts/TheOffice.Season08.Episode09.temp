dwight Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
dwight Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
dwight Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.
creed No. No. No. You're way off on that one.
dwight Oh yeah?
oscar Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
jim Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?
dwight That's right Jim.
darryl Hey man.
dwight Hey.
darryl Taking a load off huh?
dwight No. Putting a load on more like it.
darryl Good luck with that.
dwight Last thing I need is luck.
dwight Thank you so much.
jim What are you up to? Oops look out!
dwight What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
jim Prank!
dwight Oh that's real creative.
jim You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
dwight I could, but I just don't feel like it loser.
jim Because you're sitting?
dwight Standing.
jim Ok.
dwight Don't!
jim Because you're sitting?
dwight Standing.
jim You know I have to do this.
dwight I know.
andy Andrew. Baines. Bernard.
jim I think you could just do andy Bernard.
andy Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers.
robert In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
andy What was that?
jim I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.
ryan That's why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They're not going to know what hit them.
robert Everyone. I'd like to introduce my wife Mrs. robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.
susan Hello. Oh call me susan please.
robert Last night at dinner susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she's here today to see if there's a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is andy Bernard the regional manager.
susan Hello nice to meet you.
andy Hey there. It's a pleasure.
robert andy would you be so kind as to show susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she'll shine.
andy I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100 percent staffed up.
robert Andy. Let's see if there's a good fit first. Then we'll talk.
andy Alright.
dwight Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
darryl You don't have to say it if you're doing it.
dwight Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
darryl Uh weight lifting yeah.
dwight Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
darryl I'll take a look.
dwight Your path from obesity begins right here!
darryl I've been meaning to join a gym. For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
dwight Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
andy Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
susan Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
ryan Actually Ryan.
susan Oh, Ryan.
ryan Bitttch!
andy We will start here at Erinville.
susan Hi.
erin Hoo-hoo!
andy Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
erin Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
andy I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
robert Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn't you agree Andy?
andy I'll explore exploring it.
robert Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I'll just duck out and run the company for a while.
andy Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place?
jim Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
dwight Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
andy Jim?
jim Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.
dwight It's the second easiest job in the world. Being a mom.
susan I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
dwight That is true.
andy You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. dwight Schrute.
dwight That's me.
andy dwight why don't you tell susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
dwight Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale .
susan Well make that a red wine and I'll tell you my animal rankings .
andy Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? . The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.
dwight Ready? What do you think?
darryl Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
dwight You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month.
darryl Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
dwight Darryl.
darryl Make a real gym.
susan I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
andy But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
susan Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
andy Those are fully staffed as well.
robert Are you telling me that there's no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
andy Yes.
robert I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
andy Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
susan robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there's no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don't we just let it go.
robert No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
andy There are lots of considerations.
robert I would be eternally grateful. It's not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
andy Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
susan So what happens next?
andy We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. Hang on. Hello?
robert Say hello grandma.
andy Hi gam-gam.
robert Hold one finger up to Susan. You'll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, "are you taking your medicine?"
andy Are you taking your med-meds?
robert Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it.
susan You didn't say goodbye to your grandma.
andy We promised we'd never say goodbye.
dwight Attention! I am now accepting memberships for dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
oscar All I need is another gym. As if I don't have enough drama.
phyllis We have a gym at home. It's called the bedroom.
oscar Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner. That's Bruce's. Jeremy says.
angela Enough Oscar, enough.
dwight Kelly?
kelly I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
dwight That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time. . push;
toby Did you bring your passport with you?
susan Who walks around with their passport?
toby Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.
susan Have you had any?
toby No.
andy Hey, uh, guys. So robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
oscar Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her? Andy/
oscar it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
kevin How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
angela This is all pathetic.
andy I am not asking, I am ordering.
oscar How mean are we talking about?
andy It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
erin Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
erin Here you go.
susan Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
erin Well that's a sales desk.
kevin Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
jim No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
oscar That's Gerald.
jim Oh, wow. So cute.
susan Oh, that is so cute-
phyllis Aw. He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
oscar Yeah, he's in a ladle.
erin That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
oscar He did it himself.
phyllis Is that ladle stainless or.
oscar Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
susan Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup.
oscar It's not that kind of ladle.
jim Very cute.
susan Aw, let me see-
oscar Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
susan I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
susan Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
robert Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.
andy What is going on?
robert Please. Andrew, my wife. has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
andy Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?
susan Do you not want me here?
andy Why would you say that?
susan It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
andy It's not that, exactly.
susan But it is something.
andy Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
susan Why would you not want me working here?
andy I don't know.
susan I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
andy Yes! The dude is an enigma.
susan Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
andy Ah.
susan Got it.
dwight What do you think you're doing?
darryl Getting my sweat on.
dwight I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
darryl I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
dwight I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
darryl No.
dwight Eight minutes!
darryl Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
dwight Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
darryl It's Lejon Brames.
dwight That's what I said.
darryl You know, get it right.
dwight I know.
andy Cameras.
robert Oh, still here. Terrific.
susan andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
robert Well that's a shame.
andy It just was one of those things-
susan Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
robert Where did this come from? Did andy say that?
susan No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
robert What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.
susan You sure about that?
robert Absolutely.
susan No games?
robert No games.
susan Because andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
robert Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.
susan Andy?
andy Yes?
susan Why do you keep looking at my husband?
robert Andy, just answer the question.
andy No games?
robert No games.
andy Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. robert storms in and he says, "in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. "
robert You lying son of a bitch!
robert Tell my wife you're lying.
andy I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
susan That's not true, is it?
andy No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. jim knows. He was there.
robert This is preposterous.
susan Robert.
robert Let's get jim in here. Where's Jim?
erin He just rolled out and crawled out.
robert Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
jim Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open. uh, okay.
robert That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.
jim Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. Creed. I was never here, all right?
creed Okay. What about your friend?
jim Oh boy.
dwight This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
darryl Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
dwight First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
darryl Okay, I'm not doing that.
dwight Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
gabe I didn't know darryl joined.
darryl Looks that way.
gabe Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.
robert Hello Jim.
andy No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
robert So I think you know what we want to know.
jim Do I?
robert Yes.
jim I know, I do.
andy Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.
jim I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can.
susan For God's sake, did robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
jim That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's
something I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
andy I think we've got ourselves an answer.
robert No.
andy That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
jim Perfect!
susan Jim.
jim Yes?
susan Answer the question, please.
jim I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
robert All right. Thanks.
jim Yes. All right. Great.
andy Uh.
robert Yeah.
andy Yep.
susan Thank you.
robert Heh.
susan Andy.
andy Hey, Mrs. California.
susan Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
andy You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
susan Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
andy Yeah.
susan Well, different circumstances.
andy Yeah.
susan Who knows?
andy Who knows?
susan Maybe after all this settles down.
andy Totally.
susan It's a date.
andy Hmm?
dwight You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
darryl This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
dwight Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
darryl Dwight, come back and spot me.
dwight All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
darryl To push this bar up.
dwight No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
darryl Help me!
dwight What do you want!?!
darryl To look good for Val!
dwight Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow. I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
