pam This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
kevin Nice.
pam There's this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it's not -- it doesn't sound cool. You just have to see it.
pam Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal.
jim Wow. It's the end of an era.
pam Did a good job, Buddy. Now it's time to come home.
oscar I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
kevin When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
ryan How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin?
kevin I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, "Look, a balloon. "
dwight My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
meredith My kid didn't have a face tattoo.
darryl I was still thinking of going back to school.
jim And I was still just a paper salesman.
dwight Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here.
all Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon.
jim Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
kevin oooh
darryl Me.
phyllis Yeah.
dwight Right here.
nellie Allow me to solve your problem, then.
jim nellie
nellie Mmm. Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
jim What brings you to town?
nellie Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
dwight What?
dwight How could robert transfer nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
toby robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
nellie Mm.
pam What?
toby I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
pam You messed up saying your name?
toby It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
nellie That one looks empty.
jim No, that's Andy's office.
nellie Oh, is it?
nellie I have one simple philosophy in
business if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
erin Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
alonzo Good morning Erin.
erin How are you? How's your family doing?
erin Bye.
erin Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. Listen to me, bragging away.
robert Nellie.
nellie Robert.
robert How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
nellie So far, so good.
robert Good.
nellie Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
robert Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?
nellie Mm-hm.
robert Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?
nellie Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
robert We have a manager.
nellie Do you really? Because it is 10
 00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
robert Excuse me, has anyone seen andy this morning?
kevin Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
andy Hello.
robert Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?
andy Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
robert I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately.
andy Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the.
andy . Florida Flu.
robert He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
andy I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
robert Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
jim Can't you do something about this?
robert Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.
jim -Right.
jim What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
irene Erin, you got a package.
erin I'm in the bathroom.
glenn Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label.
irene Did you wash your hands?
erin Yes. erin and
irene 
andy Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
erin Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
andy Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
irene Where's the ring?
andy Hm?
irene Where's the ring, Lancelot?
erin Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
erin Um, Andy. I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
glenn Why won't she go with him?
irene I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome.
erin Hey. don't listen.
nellie So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it. chumbo?
jim I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
nellie So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. But why, m'lady? Because I am your new manager.
pam Robert, is nellie our new manager?
robert This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
robert We live in this world of routines and rhythms. kevin ate someone's lunch. phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
nellie I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
kevin Hot tub party?
nellie Performance reviews.
pam How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
nellie On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
glenn Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.
erin Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
irene So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?
andy Well, we're not really dating anymore, so. basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
erin So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
irene I think you should leave, young man.
andy all right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
erin You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
jim Any luck?
pam No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
andy Please leave a message for andy Bernard, include your na-
erin Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there.
irene You should take it. It's probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.
andy Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
irene You really wouldn't feel those kinds of results after one session.
andy I don't know. Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
irene You could put it on silent.
andy I don't think it does that.
irene Just go to preferences, then click â€“
glenn Proctology.
jim Andy?
andy Jim?
jim Andy, where are you?
andy I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
irene He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.
jim What? You're in Florida? Andy, nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
andy What do you mean, take my job?
jim Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
andy Okay. Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later. . push;
jim Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
angela Trust you? The way pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
pam I like working here.
jim Dwight, should she be our manager?
dwight I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
dwight Those who can't farm, farm celery.
jim And when was the last time dwight and I agreed on anything ever?
nellie all right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
phyllis Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
nellie Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
dwight I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
nellie Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
dwight What?
nellie Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
dwight There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
nellie Then you accept it?
dwight Five percent. No less.
nellie Absolutely not. Seven percent.
dwight Six percent, I know my worth.
jim The raise isn't real.
dwight Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
nellie So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
pam Phyllis.
phyllis Pam.
nellie So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
phyllis Really?
nellie Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there. all very impressive.
jim Um. are you aware that nellie is giving out raises?
robert I am not. Huh.
jim Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
robert Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?
jim Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
robert Jim, I told andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
jim Yes.
robert Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
jim Oh, god, nature, please.
robert When two animals are having s*x, one of them.
jim 
robert . is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
jim Was that not the--
robert all life is s*x. And all s*x is competition.
jim Mm-hm.
robert And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?
jim Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
robert My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
jim No. I would've said no.
nellie Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
kelly Oh, great.
jim I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
dwight No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
darryl No.
dwight Yes.
darryl No.
dwight Yes.
darryl No.
dwight Yes.
darryl No.
dwight Yes.
darryl No.
dwight Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
dwight Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
dwight Well fought. I accept the outcome.
creed Touch me and I'll sue.
erin I've heard that's amazing when it works.
andy Yeah, if I had my own--
erin Andy, I care about you and I think--
andy --sorry, you go.
erin No, go ahead.
andy Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
erin Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
andy You broke my heart too.
erin You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
andy I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
erin I know.
andy 
nellie So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
pam Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
nellie That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
pam Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
nellie Does jim have to breastfeed? Did jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does jim really get up in the night?
pam Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
nellie You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
pam No.
nellie Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
pam I think. you're a witch.
nellie I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say
it "I'm amazing. "
pam I'm amazing.
irene Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. andy is a nice boy.
erin Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
irene I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink--
erin Irene, what would you do without me?
irene We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot.
erin Why?
irene He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
nellie Jim, time for your review.
jim No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
nellie Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
jim Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
nellie Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
jim Yes.
nellie I'm Tinkerbell.
jim No.
nellie Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
stanley And we are grateful.
nellie But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
jim She dies.
nellie She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
jim Let's see it. Show of hands.
kevin I do. Come on everyone.
jim all right, guys, stop.
meredith I already spent the money.
jim How?
kevin Come on Jim, you're killing her!
all We believe! We believe!
robert Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe.
andy That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
erin andy wait! Andy! andy wait! Don't go! andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I'm sorry.
andy Erin!
erin Andy.
erin Let's get out of here.
andy Okay.
erin Let's go.
andy Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
erin No, I don't have any stuff.
andy Like your toothbrush and stuff.
erin I don't have one.
andy You don't have a toothbrush?
erin No.
andy How do you not have a toothbrush?
erin I just. there's always one around.
andy You just use whichever one is sitting there?
erin I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
andy Of course. I own my toothbrush.
nellie I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
