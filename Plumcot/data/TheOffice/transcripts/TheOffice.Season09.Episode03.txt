creed_bratton Jim Morning, Dwight
dwight_schrute Who are you?
creed_bratton Jim Who am I? I'm Jim. We've been working together for twelve years. Ha, Weird joke, Dwight.
dwight_schrute You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
creed_bratton Jim You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race.
dwight_schrute Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
creed_bratton Jim Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me.

Voicemail#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode03 You have one new message.
dwight_schrute How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
creed_bratton Jim Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work.
dwight_schrute You don't work here! You're not Jim!
pam_beesly Jim, I got us that dinner reservation. Grico's at 7 30.
creed_bratton Jim Oh great, can't wait.
pam_beesly Jim's at the dentist this morning. And Steve is an actor friend of ours.
dwight_schrute I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
dwight_schrute Oh my—! Oh d—! Oh, how did—? Huhhhhh!
erin_hannon Heyyy! Study buddies!
darryl_philbin Oh, ok.
erin_hannon Getting things done. Awesome!
darryl_philbin It's all about finding ways to make yourself more efficient. Life hacking, baby. This morning, I brushed my teeth in the shower. Saved my self 90 seconds. Which I just used to explain this to you. Damn it!
darryl_philbin Since Andy promoted me to assistant regional manager, I've been trying to step my game up, you know, be more productive. In fact, you know what? Let's knock out a few more of these sound bites while we're here. Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
erin_hannon S"il vous plait...dites-Moi...Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
dwight_schrute Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
erin_hannon I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
dwight_schrute You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
dwight_schrute Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
dwight_schrute I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
erin_hannon Yeah! Let's do it!
dwight_schrute Atherozar!
erin_hannon Oh!
dwight_schrute It means "excellent". And we have begun.
pam_beesly . Is everything okay?
nellie_bertram Hmm? Oh—oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine. Fine, fine, fine. I'm mean, I d—I just don't wanna—burden you with my massive stress freak outs!
pam_beesly Great.
nellie_bertram It's just that I am taking my driver's license test in two days, and I need to practice with an experienced driver in the car. But I've had no time to do that, thanks to "Demandy".... I just want to hit the open road and drive, man! But...in who's car?
andy_bernard Nellie! Get your wrinkly old balls in here.
nellie_bertram
pam_beesly Nellie, I could practice with you in my car at lunchtime.
nellie_bertram Oh, Pam, thank you! You are my savior!
nellie_bertram and Pam ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!
pam_beesly I'm sorry, I'm leaving you alone for lunch.
jim_halpert Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
nellie_bertram This is my research into how we might produce child-proof paper that doesn't give you paper cuts. We can't. And here is a print out of your genealogy from thisisyourfamilytree.com
andy_bernard Executive-summary me. Hit the highlights.
nellie_bertram Well, it turns out, you are a distant blood relative of Michelle Obama!
andy_bernard As in...
nellie_bertram Wife of Barack, loves gardening, wants to wipe out fat children.
andy_bernard Wow!
andy_bernard This is super-flattering. She's the most popular person in America. This is a big day for both of us.
andy_bernard My fellow Americans, I have a feeling my approval rating is about to go through the roof. Turns out, I am related to Michelle Obama.
erin_hannon I was intimidated by Andy's family before. And now I have to see the First Lady at holidays? She's gonna be like, "What's your stance on politics?" Or, "What is the best war to do?" And, I will just be like, "Duhhhh!"
andy_bernard Alright! We gotta get rid of all this junk food. Get fit, America! Not sure if the buzz has reached the annex yet, but uh...I'm related to Michelle Obama.
pete_miller Yeah we noticed early on, Andy really appreciates enthusiasm.
clark So we decided the best way to get ahead here is to be his cheerleaders.
clark Oooohhhhhhhh!
clark It's starting to have this reverse effect, though, where I really do think the stuff he does is awesome.
pete_miller Yeah, me too. It's weird. Hard to remember what's real at this point.
clark Just clap through it, man.
darryl_philbin You log in sales at ten different times. If you log ‘em all at once, you save a lot of time. It's called batching.
jim_halpert That was really good, Darryl.
darryl_philbin Life hacking, man.
andy_bernard There he is!
jim_halpert Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me—.
andy_bernard Ahhhthathathathathta. Right now I need canned tuna, okay? Darryl, guess which talented individual, who also has a killer singing voice, is related to the First Lady?
darryl_philbin Tracee Ellis Ross. Daughter of the First Lady of Motown, Diana Ross.
andy_bernard It's me! I am related to Michelle Obama.
darryl_philbin What?! Really?
andy_bernard I mean, it's distant, but...
darryl_philbin Huh ha! That's cool, man.
andy_bernard Right?
andy_bernard Darryl said, "Cool, man." He called me as cool man.
pam_beesly You know, I really do think it would be worth it to pull over and just take ten minutes to eat.
nellie_bertram Mmmm—the thing is Pam, I'm gonna be eating while I'm driving, so, I might as well get good at it.
pam_beesly Brake lights. Break lights! Break lights! Break lights!!!
nellie_bertram Whhooooo!
oscar_martinez I'm just saying, what does it imply in this country when a white person shares an ancestor with a black person?
phyllis_vance You think that Andy's family owned slaves?
stanley_hudson Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
dwight_schrute I throat-rip.
erin_hannon Foth aggendak!
dwight_schrute You throat-rip.
erin_hannon Foth aggendi!
dwight_schrute He/she/it throat rips.
erin_hannon Foth aggenda!
dwight_schrute More of a, barbaric growl.
erin_hannon Forth aggenda!
dwight_schrute Louder! You're shouting it from the back of a horse!
erin_hannon Wah!! Aggenda!!
pam_beesly Pretty crazy about Andy and Michelle Obama, huh?
nellie_bertram Yeeeeahhhh! It's almost unbelievable!
pam_beesly What?
nellie_bertram Well, you know how Andy has been really salting my onions, lately.
pam_beesly Sure.
nellie_bertram Well, when he asked me to look up his ancestry online, I remembered that news story about Michelle Obama having white relatives, and I just knew he would eat that up!
pam_beesly So he's not related to Michelle Obama?
nellie_bertram Pam, I barely know how to turn on my computer.
pam_beesly
pam_beesly Nellie's pretty fearless. And I think she might be maybe even almost sort of fun.
nellie_bertram Pam! .
pam_beesly
oscar_martinez Well, if there's another explanation, I don't really see what it could possibly be. I—
andy_bernard What's going on here? I'm related to the first lady, okay? Get over it. I still need weekly status reports from most of you, sooooo, can we get back to work, please? Get back to work! .
oscar_martinez Andy! Andy! No! I would be very polite today.
andy_bernard Why? Is it employee's day or something? I cannot keep track of these BS holidays.
oscar_martinez Your connection. To Michelle Obama has certain... negative connotations. Most likely, your family were—slave owners.
andy_bernard Does anyone else think it's possible that I come from slave owners?
darryl_philbin Whoa! That person has really gotten him or herself into quite a predicament.
andy_bernard Hey mom, it's Andy. Give me a call when you get a chance gotta quick question for you, uhhhh no big deal just about America's national shame, thanks, Bye. Where were we? Uhhhh, yes. Okay. Your...productivity thing.
darryl_philbin Yes, yes, yes.
andy_bernard Great. Ooo! Spreadsheets! Yum, yum!
darryl_philbin I included some time saving ideas...
andy_bernard Huh huh huh. Look, I'm not gonna lie to ya, I'm a teensy bit distracted right now.
darryl_philbin Look, Andy, even if your ancestors did own slaves, it wouldn't be your fault. This is only weird if you make it weird.
andy_bernard Right on, brotha. Wurddd.
erin_hannon Addor!
dwight_schrute Daraas!
erin_hannon Qazer!
dwight_schrute Daraas! Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?
pete_miller Hey Erin!
erin_hannon Azem choma! Chomakka-attun!
pete_miller Oh—okay. Sorry.
nellie_bertram Oh, still, it must great to have something else going on outside of work.
pam_beesly Yeah—turn signal. It's exciting to be painting again—those are the wipers. So—the—its—just. There you go! Yeah. Yeah, things get so busy with the kids—red light—that it's nice to have that creative outlet—red light! Red light! Red! Red!
nellie_bertram That is brilliant, Pam. I would love to see some of your work.
pam_beesly Well, since we're stopped at a light, uhhh, here is...the mural I did for Angela's baby.
nellie_bertram That's amazing, Pam! Oh, I love the lion in the tuxedo!
pam_beesly Angela insisted that all the animals be fully clothed.
andy_bernard . Heyyy, has anyone turned in their status reports up here?
erin_hannon Vos!
andy_bernard So, no? You think maybe you could remind people? I'm trying to down play the whole bossy boss thing today.
erin_hannon Because of your slaves.
andy_bernard Not my slaves, my ancestors'. Maybe. Probably not.
erin_hannon Well, if it makes you feel any better, the dothraki word for "slave master", "attafrauk!", is a term of respect. I'm learning how to speak dothraki! Color you impressed?
andy_bernard That you're learning a made-up language from HBO's Game of Thrones? I have a lot going on today...but this was a great nerd-out!
erin_hannon Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
dwight_schrute People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
andy_bernard Hi guys.
phyllis_vance Hey boss! I am so thirsty. Could I have a scoop of water?
andy_bernard Yeah. You don't have to ask me.
andy_bernard Ha ha! Okay. Great. Very funny. I get it. Just because my ancestors happen to be—. Very funny, Kevin. Changed my ringtone. Very funny. I liked the original song on my ringtone, which, you may remember, was "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes" by Paul Simon, featurinnnngg Lady Smith—African American—Mambazo.
pam_beesly Good. Very good. Oh—no! Here. It's, uh, a text from Andy. "New special proj. Need fam tree for evbody. Really dig up dirt A.S.A.P." And then in parentheses, he wrote out "as soon as possible."
nellie_bertram Mm. Ugh, looks like its pretend-y time again. Write back, "looking for dirt."
pam_beesly Oh, can I help? We could say someone is related to, uhm, Tonya Harding.
nellie_bertram Pam, I'm related to Tonya Harding.
pam_beesly Oh—gee—I'm—
nellie_bertram No! I'm just practicing my lyyiiinggg! I love it.
pam_beesly Brilliant!
nellie_bertram What should we say about Jim?
pam_beesly Ummm. Oh! I'll say he's related to Richard Nixon. It's an inside joke. He looks really Nixon-y when he wakes up.
nellie_bertram My ex behaved like Nixon. All of the lying. None of the sexual charisma. I just made a joke there.
pam_beesly I'm sorry. It's just, uhm, I actually do have this weird feeling that there's something Jim isn't telling me.
nellie_bertram Oh no! Oh! An affair! It is always an affair!
pam_beesly Jim? No.
nellie_bertram . How can you be sure?
pam_beesly Because he just loves me too much.
nellie_bertram You're a cocky little thing, aren't you, Pam?
andy_bernard I've done a little genealogy research of my own. Turn out I'm not the only one with a few skeletons in the ol' family closet. For example, Phyllis's great-great grandmother was responsible for spreading cholera to the United States.
angela_martin Ew.
andy_bernard Kevin is related to both John Wayne Gacy and John Wayne Bobbitt.
kevin_malone And John Wayne?
andy_bernard No. Not that I see here.
kevin_malone Wayne Johnson? The Rock?
andy_bernard You mean Dwayne? And no. What about Jim Halpert? Uh oh! Turns out, distant relative of the reviled, Richard Nixon!
jim_halpert Pam always says I look like Nixon. That's crazy, right? I mean there's nothing there. True— Oh no.
andy_bernard Dwight's grandfather was a—.
dwight_schrute Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So...
andy_bernard I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
dwight_schrute Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
andy_bernard And Meredith is a blood relative of Lizzie Borden.
meredith_palmer Cool! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
angela_martin Stop it! Stop it! You're frightening me!
phyllis_vance Andy, did you call this meeting just to talk junk about our families?
kevin_malone Yeah, that—you're being really mean, Andy.
dwight_schrute Yeah, Andy.
andy_bernard No, I'm proving a point, okay? We all have ancestors who may have done horrible things in the past. But it's in the past and it's not our fault. So we don't have to talk about it.
oscar_martinez The difference is, Andy, that you're the only be here still benefitting from the terrible things that your ancestors did.
andy_bernard Might've done. And how... do you figure?
oscar_martinez Your family's rich! I have to believe that a big part of the Bernard fortune was earned on the backs of slaves.
andy_bernard You know, there's nothing wrong with being successful in America, Oscar! I'm not gonna apologize for my family's wealth. That wealth, could one day benefit society...if capital gains are ever taxed as the same rate as earned income.
andy_bernard Okay, Kevin did that. I do not wish I was in Dixie.
andy_bernard Hey mom, how are ya? Did any Bernards ever own a plantation in the south?
andy_bernard She said no! Take that!
andy_bernard Follow up question. Did any Bernards, ever, make money, in an unsavory way?
andy_bernard I just asked you! Why didn't you just say that?
andy_bernard Oh, stop! Stop! Stop talking! Stop taking! That's—no! I don't wanna know that. Ok. You're interrupting a meeting I have to go. Love you. Bye.
andy_bernard Well, turns out the Bernard's of yore did not own slaves.
oscar_martinez Really?
andy_bernard We merely transported them. Which at worst, makes us amoral middlemen.
andy_bernard Yo, d-dog. I need your help. I'm trying to think of things I can say that make it sound like I had a more difficult childhood than I actually had.
darryl_philbin You're gonna po' mouth
andy_bernard Exactly. Help me po' mouth, Darryl.
darryl_philbin Actually, Andy, you promised me five minutes to talk about productivity suggestions—
andy_bernard What if I said that my dad beat me. And, I just left out the croquet of it all. Or, I could just go all the way and just say I grew up in an apartment. Or is that too crazy?
darryl_philbin That could work.
andy_bernard You now, Darryl, this is textbook assistant regional manager stuff here, and I feel like I'm doing all the heavy lifting. I'm coming up with all the ideas here.
darryl_philbin I'm going for a walk.
andy_bernard Okay.
pam_beesly Good. Good. And—
jim_halpert You doing alright, man?
darryl_philbin I'm done. I gotta get out of here.
jim_halpert Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
darryl_philbin It's not just today, it's everyday. It seems like the better title I have, the stupider my job gets.
jim_halpert Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
darryl_philbin Hmm. Yeah right
jim_halpert No, I'm serious. There's always something better.
darryl_philbin Like what?
jim_halpert Like hypothetically... if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
darryl_philbin What kind of job?
jim_halpert Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
darryl_philbin Hell yeah!
jim_halpert Right?
darryl_philbin That sounds awesome!
jim_halpert Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
darryl_philbin I love Philly!
jim_halpert Right?
darryl_philbin It's not even a thought—
jim_halpert Not even a thought! It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
darryl_philbin What? Wait, wait, wait? So what? This happening?
jim_halpert Oh, it's happening! Let's just keep it between you and me for right now.
darryl_philbin Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. for sure. Man! And Pam's into it?
jim_halpert We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she's—I think she understands... what this is.
darryl_philbin Oh, come on, man. I thought you had something real.
jim_halpert What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
darryl_philbin It's not real... until your wife is on board.
pam_beesly So what did you want to show me?
nellie_bertram That is quite an ugly wall, isn't it?
pam_beesly Yeah. It's really ugly
nellie_bertram Needs something, doesn't it? I'm thinking...a mural.
pam_beesly You mean me?
nellie_bertram Yes! You! You are soo talented! It's going to be my next special project. Hiring Scranton's most dangerous young muralist to paint the warehouse wall.
pam_beesly Oh my god! I love it! Uh, I—Nellie, this is brilliant! Hey!
jim_halpert Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
nellie_bertram Anything you have to say to her, you can say to me. She never loved you!
pam_beesly What?! No! I-I got this. Okay?
nellie_bertram This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
nellie_bertram And Filipino. But we'll break that to her later.
nellie_bertram You know what this is all about.
darryl_philbin Yeah. You too, huh?
nellie_bertram Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
darryl_philbin Hey! He deserves this. And he said I could get in on it too. Yeah.
nellie_bertram Ohhh, Pam, nooo! Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
jim_halpert I don't know what I was so worried about. I have the best wife in the world.
pam_beesly I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
pam_beesly I was helping Nellie drive—
stanley_hudson Do not care.
pete_miller Fonas chek!
erin_hannon Dothraas! chek!
andy_bernard I like that guy. We should hook him up with Meredith.
erin_hannon Hmmm!
