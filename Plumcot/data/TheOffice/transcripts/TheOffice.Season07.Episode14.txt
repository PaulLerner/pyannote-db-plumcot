kelly_kapoor Everybody, can I please have your attention? Ryan and I have a huge announcement.
erin_hannon Oh my gosh!
phyllis_vance Wow.
kelly_kapoor Over the weekend, Ryan Bailey Howard and I got divorced.
meredith_palmer Sweet! Free Ring!
andy_bernard Divorced?
ryan_howard Just so you know, it's totally amicable. We're fine. We don't need people here to take sides.
kelly_kapoor The last thing that we want is any kind of drama.
pam_beesly Wait. Can you back up? What's the story?
kelly_kapoor We were having a beautiful weekend in the Poconos. We were making love, constantly. We saw the sunrise. Ryan was crying a lot.
ryan_howard It's not irrelevant. Details
kelly_kapoor And in the morning we walked by a chapel and we stopped, suddenly, and Ryan said...
ryan_howard and Kelly I don't think I should be married to you anymore.
kevin_malone What?
andy_bernard Sorry, when did you get married?
kelly_kapoor Ummm, like a week ago, we got really wasted and it just felt right.
andy_bernard And you didn't invite any of us?
ryan_howard We are getting divorced, Andy! This is such a raw time.
kelly_kapoor God baby, you know, people's reactions to this... maybe we made a mistake.
ryan_howard No, with the messed up laws in this country, I don't want to be married until everyone can be married.
oscar_martinez You know what Ryan, I talked to the other gay guys, and we're ok with it. We agree it's fine if you got married.
ryan_howard No Oscar, Not, not until everyone can!
kelly_kapoor Ryan, I changed my mind.
ryan_howard Ok fine, you know what, this actually isn't amicable at all and we actually do need people to take sides. Who is on my side?
kelly_kapoor And who is on my side?
jim_halpert All right. Bye.
pam_beesly Bye.
jim_halpert Let's Go!
michael_scott Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
holly_flax For what?
michael_scott You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
holly_flax Don't you have a sales call to go on?
michael_scott I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
holly_flax We don't know that.
michael_scott Sure we do.
holly_flax Why is it such a certainty that we are supposed to be together?
michael_scott Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
holly_flax Michael, I can't keep getting into a situation where I date whoever I'm working with. Well, you can understand that.
michael_scott Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.
holly_flax Well you don't have to agree.
michael_scott Yes I do.
holly_flax No you don't.
michael_scott Yes I do.
holly_flax No, you can have your own opinion.
michael_scott I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
jim_halpert He's going to be a lot of fun to drive around in a car with.
pam_beesly Aw you'll get through it hon. Just make a game out of it. A funny "Jim" game.
jim_halpert That's it? That's all I get? Even after all the hard work I put into celebrating your talent today?
pam_beesly All right, what'd you do?
jim_halpert Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art.
pam_beesly Where'd you put it?
jim_halpert Where'd I put what?
michael_scott Let's go.
jim_halpert Oh, sorry gotta go.
pam_beesly Say it. Where?
jim_halpert Ok fine, three hints. One! When you are getting colder, you're really getting warmer.
pam_beesly The fridge.
jim_halpert Two! You have a better chance, if you think Bob Vance.
pam_beesly The fridge, got it.
jim_halpert And the final clue...
michael_scott Let's go!
jim_halpert You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine.
pam_beesly Bye.
erin_hannon Holly is ruining Michael's life. He thinks she is so special. And she's so not. Her personality is like a 3. Her sense of humor is a 2. Her ears are like a 7and a 4. Add it all up and what do you get? 16. And he treats her like she's a perfect 40. It's nuts.
jim_halpert Cheer up. We made a sale.
michael_scott Just drive faster. I want to get back.
jim_halpert Well, I'm going the speed limit. So...
michael_scott Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
jim_halpert Someone's in a bad mood.
michael_scott No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is s*x different after the baby, Jim?
jim_halpert Alright, let me turn on some music.
michael_scott I need to pee.
jim_halpert No you don't.
michael_scott Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
jim_halpert Alright. Well we'll be there in ten minutes.
michael_scott What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
jim_halpert Alright, Well if I see a gas station, I'll pull over.
michael_scott Well I hope I make it.
jim_halpert Hello?
helene_beesly Hi Jim, it's Helen.
jim_halpert Hey Helen. Is everything ok?
helene_beesly Everything is fine. Baby's fine. She has a tiny fever. I'm taking her for a check up. Nothing to worry about.
jim_halpert Ok...
helene_beesly A tiny thing. I locked her in the car.
jim_halpert What?
helene_beesly She's smiling. She's happy.
jim_halpert Oh my God.
helene_beesly Jim, I don't have a spare key.
jim_halpert Just stay there. I'll be there in one second. Michael! Michael! Excuse me, sir there is a guy in the bathroom. He's coming out but I have to go because it's an emergency. Will you just tell him call the office. Just call the office! Thank you. Please?
jumpsuit_guy Hello?
pam_beesly This is Pam.
jim_halpert Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.
pam_beesly What's wrong?
jim_halpert Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
pam_beesly Jim, what?
jim_halpert Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car.
pam_beesly Oh God! What?!
jim_halpert No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra.
pam_beesly Ok. She's ok?
jim_halpert Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.
pam_beesly Understood.
jim_halpert And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.
pam_beesly Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a "Ask Pam Beasley". ... Did the phone cut off?
jim_halpert Nope.
pam_beesly Alright, just call me after the doctor.
jim_halpert Ok. Bye.
pam_beesly Bye.
michael_scott I know, I know you have a phone policy. I understand. But this is an emergency because my friend isn't here and I am worried that he has been abducted.
gas_station_attendant No, he ditched you man. I saw him drive away.
michael_scott There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
gas_station_attendant Just make it quick.
michael_scott Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick. And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
gas_station_attendant You don't know it.
michael_scott You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.
gas_station_attendant He left you here on purpose. All right? I saw it. He just drove away.
michael_scott Actually this is good. I am going to take this opportunity to go walk-about. Good. Good. Nope, get away. No, that's enough. Ok.
holly_flax It's the gas station on Benet Street?
pam_beesly Yeah.
holly_flax Ok.
erin_hannon You know what? Why don't you stay and I'll go?
holly_flax Oh no no no. I'll be fine.
erin_hannon It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
dwight_schrute Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
pam_beesly Cute. Very funny, everyone. Who wrote captions under my doodle? I'm not even kidding. They're pretty good.
oscar_martinez Which on in particular?
andy_bernard Yeah, which one?
pam_beesly Well the first one has a surprise factor. "I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!"
andy_bernard Boo-yea!
gabe_lewis No no. No no no.
pam_beesly But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.
oscar_martinez You suppose?
darryl_philbin What's it say?
oscar_martinez "I'm suppose to be wearing red gloves but my color cartridge portal, got jammed again."
gabe_lewis Ok. No no no.
kevin_malone Red gloves.
darryl_philbin Keep it real.
pam_beesly You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.
darryl_philbin And I will take you all down.
andy_bernard You?
darryl_philbin I've been reading the comics to my daughter since she was three years old. Not once I have used the real captions to Family Circus. That crazy family is hilarious to her for one reason me.
andy_bernard Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.
pam_beesly Yes. You guys, I have the perfect idea. Ok, it will just take me ten minutes.
andy_bernard Woo-hoo.
kevin_malone I can't wait.
dwight_schrute Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type marsupial.
erin_hannon He answers to Michal. Michal G. Scott. Michael J. Fox. Mr. Fox. The Incredible Mr. Fox.
gas_station_attendant Yeah, he just left.
holly_flax Which way did he go?
dwight_schrute Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
holly_flax Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
gas_station_attendant She's right. He went that way.
dwight_schrute Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. Let's ride.
michael_scott Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? I'm being serious. Seriously.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
dwight_schrute Has Michael checked in?
pam_beesly Oh, hey Dwight.
dwight_schrute I asked you a question.
pam_beesly No, he hasn't.
dwight_schrute Goodbye.
pam_beesly No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
dwight_schrute Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
erin_hannon No.
dwight_schrute This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
pam_beesly Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
dwight_schrute Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
pam_beesly Ok, well it wasn't obvious so...
dwight_schrute No word from Michael.
holly_flax Oh.
pam_beesly Ta-da!
kevin_malone Ok, it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island.
oscar_martinez Ok. I got one.
pam_beesly Yeah?
oscar_martinez Yes!
gabe_lewis Ok, I'm sorry but I am going to have to shut this down.
Office#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode14 Boo!
meredith_palmer Why?
gabe_lewis Unless we can all agree to some ground rules. It's either that or I can fax this to Joe and let her decide how to proceed.
darryl_philbin Gabe, tell us your stupid rules so we can start the game.
gabe_lewis Number one, and this should be obvious, no captions that insult the company we work for.
oscar_martinez Irony is such a critical...
gabe_lewis Number two no pop culture references.
pam_beesly Seriously?
oscar_martinez Wow.
gabe_lewis I think we can all agree that they tend to alienate those who don't get the reference, making them feel like the other.
darryl_philbin Wrap it up, Gabe.
gabe_lewis Ok final thing, and this is a fun one Instead of writing the caption directly under the picture, let's all try using Sticky Quips. All right? New, from Dunder Mifflin Sabre.
gabe_lewis Sticky Quips are fun. They are safe. They are handy. I like to use Sticky Quips as regular Post-It notes when I am in a fun mood. Not every day.
gabe_lewis Go get 'em. Start quipin'.
oscar_martinez Pam, I think I'm going to send you an IM.
pam_beesly Oh! Ok.
darryl_philbin Send me one too.
andy_bernard Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.
phyllis_vance C.C
kevin_malone Ditto.
michael_scott Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.
joe_the_hot_dog_vendor Dog Guy I'm not a pawn shop.
michael_scott Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
joe_the_hot_dog_vendor Dog Guy Wow.
michael_scott With that I can buy... half the menu.
joe_the_hot_dog_vendor Dog Guy I can't just go giving away hot dogs.
michael_scott All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
joe_the_hot_dog_vendor Dog Guy Throw 'em away.
michael_scott Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?
joe_the_hot_dog_vendor Dog Guy No.
michael_scott Okay. You've just lost my business.
dwight_schrute Hey.
erin_hannon Hey, you were in there forever.
dwight_schrute There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
erin_hannon She wandered off like an idiot.
dwight_schrute Hey!
holly_flax Hey.
dwight_schrute What are you doing?
holly_flax Oh, just changing my cell phone plan. Okay. Okay. Here you go. I'll take my free stress ball too now.
cellphones_pos_attendant Phone Sales Person Sure thing. Here you go, Miss... Okay, Fanny Smellmore. Real original.
holly_flax What?
cellphones_pos_attendant Phone Sales Person You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me.
dwight_schrute Tootenbacher.
erin_hannon Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
dwight_schrute and Erin farts popcorn.
dwight_schrute Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
holly_flax Are their egg rolls really that big?
michael_scott Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?
chinese_restaurant_waiter No problem.
michael_scott Okay. I'll be right back. . Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
chinese_restaurant_waiter So you can't pay for your food?
michael_scott Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
chinese_restaurant_waiter You did not. You have no money. And you dined so much.
michael_scott Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
chinese_restaurant_waiter Mr. Chu!
joe_the_hot_dog_vendor Okay, all right. You know what?
chinese_restaurant_waiter You were trying to steal food from us?
michael_scott I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
chinese_restaurant_waiter You can't. We'll stop you.
michael_scott Well, I think I can get through the door.
dwight_schrute Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
erin_hannon It's Michael!
chinese_restaurant_waiter He just left.
erin_hannon You knew.
holly_flax What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
dwight_schrute Uncanny. Put a pin in that. Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
chinese_restaurant_waiter I think he was heading downtown.
dwight_schrute He's heading downtown.
gabe_lewis So what, no one's even gonna try?
pam_beesly Guess not.
gabe_lewis Oh, come on. My rules could not possibly have been that oppressive.
darryl_philbin You crushed our spirits, Gabe. Congrats. You're a big man, huh? Take a lot to destroy the creativity of a whole group of people.
gabe_lewis Hey...
stanley_hudson Click the "x"
phyllis_vance I'm clicking!
stanley_hudson In the box.
phyllis_vance I am clicking.
stanley_hudson Woman, you've had a computer for years!
andy_bernard Phyllis!
gabe_lewis Too late! Oh. Ha. An IM chat. Very clever. I'll just print that out. Come on guys. Grow up. I don't want to be your babysitter.
andy_bernard Oooohhh.
gabe_lewis "Darn it Bob. I told you not to buy a Sabre brand lifeboat."
kevin_malone Nice!
gabe_lewis No, not nice. Terrible. Doesn't even include the fact that they're dogs.
andy_bernard Do the next one.
gabe_lewis "Wake up, Fred. The power cord on your Sabre printer shocked you into a coma, and you're dreaming you're a dog on a desert island.'
darryl_philbin Dreaming he's a dog on a island.
gabe_lewis Uh, excuse me, excuse me. How does the speaker know what the guy in the coma is dreaming?
phyllis_vance Well, if you think it's so easy, Gabe, why don't you try it?
gabe_lewis Umm... "You don't have to sniff my rear end anymore, Bob, I'm the only one here." Ha.
oscar_martinez That's tasteless, Gabe.
gabe_lewis Tasteless?
oscar_martinez Tasteless.
gabe_lewis More tasteless than this..."is that a palm tree or did Gabe get skinnier? Either way, let's pee on it."
pam_beesly Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.
phyllis_vance Yes.
kevin_malone Yes, well done!
oscar_martinez Who's is it? Who wrote that?
phyllis_vance Yeah, who wrote it?
angela_martin Please. It was easy once I decided I wanted the dog to piss on Gabe.
erin_hannon Where did he go, Holly?
holly_flax I have no idea.
dwight_schrute Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, "this way, this way"?
holly_flax I don't know.
dwight_schrute Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
holly_flax Will you stop! There has been a few coincidences, that's all.
dwight_schrute All right then. Someone propose a plan.
erin_hannon Okay. We fan out...
dwight_schrute Not you, Erin.
holly_flax Stop looking at me like that. Okay, let's just go up somewhere high and see if we could spot him on the street below.
dwight_schrute That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
holly_flax Look, I'm not playing. I'm gonna go look for him.
erin_hannon Good. We don't need her.
dwight_schrute Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling.
holly_flax Michael?
michael_scott Hi. How did you know I was up here?
holly_flax What are you doing up here?
michael_scott I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
holly_flax Dunder Mifflin.
michael_scott Yeah. Wow. I just miss you so much.
holly_flax I missed you too.
michael_scott Really?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott Can I kiss you?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott Okay.
phyllis_vance Maybe that's not the best one. Keep reading.
gabe_lewis Uh, it was.
meredith_palmer Maybe it wasn't.
gabe_lewis "Oh, thank God. I had a horrible nightmare that I was stuck in America with Gabe."
andy_bernard Oh!
phyllis_vance No, that's not the one I was thinking of. Keep going.
gabe_lewis "I know what it smells like but I didn't roll in anything. It's from listening to all of Gabe's bull. "Isn't this the perfect romantic getaway, Erin? Sitting on a deserted island wearing dog costumes? I'm Gabe and I'm a weirdo."
andy_bernard
gabe_lewis "Gabe's mom... hmm... Gabe's mom? Wait. Tall woman? Looks like Gabe? Yeah, I banged her."
phyllis_vance Yeah, there you go.
