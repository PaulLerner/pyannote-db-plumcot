michael_scott Buenos dias, Erin.
erin_hannon Buenos dias, Miguel. Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
michael_scott No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
michael_scott I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
michael_scott Buenos dias, Jaime.
jim_halpert Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
michael_scott Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Guten tag, Herr Michael.
dwight_schrute I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
michael_scott La telefona.
oscar_martinez El telefono.
oscar_martinez Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... I should have been more specific.
oscar_martinez Your office is full of genitalia.
michael_scott Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
oscar_martinez "That's what he says?"
michael_scott Damn it. Ah, Angelo.
angela_martin Angela. Michael.
michael_scott Yo soy Cancun.
angela_martin Uhh!
jim_halpert All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
pam_beesly You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee."
jim_halpert Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
michael_scott Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
dwight_schrute You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
michael_scott I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
dwight_schrute If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
jim_halpert That's a good point.
pam_beesly This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
jim_halpert Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
pam_beesly We have good give and take. I give, he takes.
jim_halpert I don't even know who you are anymore.
pam_beesly Yee.
donna Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.
jim_halpert Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
donna Hi!
jim_halpert How are you?
michael_scott Did somebody order a hooker over here?
donna Oh, stop that.
michael_scott Hi. How are you?
michael_scott There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
michael_scott Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
donna You look exactly alike.
pam_beesly Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
donna I have a sense about these things.
jim_halpert All right.
donna You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
angela_martin I knew it. You should see their baby.
jim_halpert So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate So it's a tradeoff.
michael_scott Hi.
jim_halpert Hold on one second.
michael_scott Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
jim_halpert What?
michael_scott Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
jim_halpert None of this is time sensitive.
michael_scott Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
donna Oh, yeah, thank you.
michael_scott Okay, I have more of them.
gabe_lewis You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
darryl_philbin Sounds all right.
dwight_schrute What is this?
gabe_lewis Oh, this is "Print in All Colors," Sabre's minority executive training program.
dwight_schrute It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
darryl_philbin I didn't say "a'ight."
dwight_schrute How do I apply?
gabe_lewis You have to be a minority.
dwight_schrute Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
gabe_lewis Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
dwight_schrute Come here. Come here.
gabe_lewis Hmm?
dwight_schrute Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
gabe_lewis Well...
darryl_philbin I like the sound of this. Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
dwight_schrute One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
kelly_kapoor This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
dwight_schrute Oh, man. White people, right?
kelly_kapoor I don't know if she was white.
dwight_schrute Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
kelly_kapoor Yeah.
dwight_schrute I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
kelly_kapoor Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
dwight_schrute I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
kelly_kapoor Never thought of myself as an executive before.
dwight_schrute I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
kelly_kapoor I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
dwight_schrute You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
kelly_kapoor I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
dwight_schrute That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
michael_scott I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
donna Mm-hmm.
michael_scott And that would be a display of the crisp, gorgeous black.
donna Yeah.
michael_scott It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
michael_scott This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
donna Who took the photo?
michael_scott Ryan.
donna Oh.
michael_scott And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
donna Not bad.
michael_scott Oh, thanks. You're not bad, either.
donna Thank you. Hmm.
michael_scott Hmm.
donna Oh my God.
michael_scott Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
michael_scott You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
jim_halpert No.
pam_beesly I'll have one.
jim_halpert Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
michael_scott Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
jim_halpert Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
pam_beesly Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
donna Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
michael_scott Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
pam_beesly What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
jim_halpert What?
jim_halpert What was that?
pam_beesly Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
jim_halpert Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
pam_beesly Who cares? It's not that huge a sale.
jim_halpert Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
pam_beesly Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. Good luck, wingman.
dwight_schrute How as being a minority affected you?
kelly_kapoor Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
dwight_schrute Oh, good, and you resent this because...
kelly_kapoor Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
dwight_schrute Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
kelly_kapoor Just put it in your pocket.
michael_scott and Donna
kevin_malone Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
phyllis_vance You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
creed_bratton You ever notice you can ooze two things sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
phyllis_vance She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
pam_beesly Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
kevin_malone Like that?
donna Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
jim_halpert Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
donna Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
jim_halpert What's that?
michael_scott Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
jim_halpert I don't... I don't think so.
michael_scott I think we could.
oscar_martinez I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
michael_scott Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
oscar_martinez Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
michael_scott Why don't you run them again?
jim_halpert What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
michael_scott If she is, it's working.
kevin_malone Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says "no," then she is not interested.
jim_halpert She does not like him.
pam_beesly You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
jim_halpert 'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
pam_beesly I was after your money.
jim_halpert Well, the joke was on you.
pam_beesly Yes, it was.
kelly_kapoor Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
ryan_howard Okay...
dwight_schrute Hey... what are you guys doing?
kelly_kapoor This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
ryan_howard Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
kelly_kapoor Oh, that is so good.
dwight_schrute You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
kelly_kapoor Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
dwight_schrute Ryan? What does he know?
ryan_howard It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
kelly_kapoor Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
dwight_schrute "We?"
kelly_kapoor When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
ryan_howard And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
dwight_schrute Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
michael_scott So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
donna Mm-hmm.
michael_scott Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. Just kidding. Do you like mints?
donna Yes.
michael_scott I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
donna Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
michael_scott They're good
donna You want one?
michael_scott Sure.
donna It's like cool... "certified cool." I like how they say "certified." Like there's some consortium of... Michael!
michael_scott I can't stop myself from kissing her.
kevin_malone Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
andy_bernard Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
kevin_malone Well, why don't you shut up!
michael_scott Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
jim_halpert It is totally insane.
oscar_martinez Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
michael_scott Okay. What do you think?
kevin_malone I think it's over, man.
michael_scott Andy?
andy_bernard Ehh.
michael_scott Okay, some for, some against.
jim_halpert Nobody's for.
michael_scott Pam?
pam_beesly Hmm?
michael_scott What do you think?
pam_beesly Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.
jim_halpert Okay.
pam_beesly Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
michael_scott I'm going with Pam's group.
jim_halpert Wait.
michael_scott Here we go.
jim_halpert Michael. Michael.
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert Michael.
michael_scott No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
dwight_schrute Kelly is disqualified!
gabe_lewis What?
dwight_schrute You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
gabe_lewis Yeah, but she's not white, though.
dwight_schrute Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
gabe_lewis Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
darryl_philbin I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
dwight_schrute Kelly is the only applicant.
gabe_lewis Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
kelly_kapoor Namaste.
dwight_schrute Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
kelly_kapoor Hello.
gabe_lewis That's very nice. I never noticed that before.
kelly_kapoor Sometimes my bangs cover it.
gabe_lewis Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
kelly_kapoor I do find that offensive, actually.
michael_scott We should have your contract done by Thursday.
donna Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
michael_scott Okay.
donna And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
michael_scott Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
donna Thank you. Did I... get everything?
michael_scott I don't know. I think so.
donna Yeah, I think so.
michael_scott Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
donna Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
donna No, it's just in the lot, so...
michael_scott Thank you so much.
donna You're welcome. You're... welcome.
michael_scott Mmm.
donna Bye.
michael_scott Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
donna I don't have, uh, any other questions. I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
michael_scott All right. All right. Bye.
donna Bye-bye!
michael_scott And have a good elevator ride.
donna Okay.
michael_scott Oh, what's that out there?
kevin_malone Michael, how did it go?
dwight_schrute How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
erin_hannon Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
dwight_schrute I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
erin_hannon I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
dwight_schrute What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
stanley_hudson Dwight, I know these programs. "Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow."
dwight_schrute Yes.
stanley_hudson I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
erin_hannon Mm!
dwight_schrute Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
oscar_martinez Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
dwight_schrute I can protect you from Kelly. Will you get out of here? Seriously.
kelly_kapoor For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
dwight_schrute Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program "print in all colors" initiative.
kelly_kapoor Dwight What are you doing?
dwight_schrute Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
kelly_kapoor God, I hate you so much!
dwight_schrute Caucasians, am I right? Have a seat. I'll translate.
hidetoshi_hasagawa Why? I don't need translator.
dwight_schrute You don't know what you need. Just...
gabe_lewis Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
hidetoshi_hasagawa In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand.
pam_beesly Hey, Michael. How you doing?
michael_scott I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
pam_beesly You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
michael_scott She suckered you too.
pam_beesly Mm-hmm.
michael_scott Was it the cleavage?
pam_beesly Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
michael_scott Yep.
phyllis_vance Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
andy_bernard You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
erin_hannon Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
michael_scott God. She left this here?
erin_hannon Yeah.
michael_scott Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
jim_halpert What?
all@ No.
michael_scott Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
oscar_martinez It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
pam_beesly Michael...
michael_scott Well...
pam_beesly She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
michael_scott Yeah, I know. I know.
pam_beesly I'm sorry.
michael_scott I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
pam_beesly Michael!
michael_scott
donna Michael!
michael_scott Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
gabe_lewis Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. All right.
gabe_lewis They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
kelly_kapoor And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
erin_hannon Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
kelly_kapoor Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
erin_hannon Great.
dwight_schrute Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it.
kelly_kapoor Thank you, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Oh.
kelly_kapoor I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
dwight_schrute Gosh. He he.
kelly_kapoor Because I never forget anything.
dwight_schrute Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
michael_scott You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
donna No, y-you were... right.
michael_scott Who?
donna You were right.
michael_scott About what?
donna You were right. I'm sorry.
michael_scott No, no. No.
donna I'm sor...
michael_scott No...
michael_scott What happened?
erin_hannon Kelly got into the minority training program.
michael_scott Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! I kissed. We kissed.
kevin_malone Ooh.
phyllis_vance Oh, Michael.
michael_scott No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
michael_scott You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. I did do it!
