michael All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
jim Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So.
michael So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
jim Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
michael All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
michael Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. That was a woman I was talking to, so. She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so. So that's the way it's done.
michael I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here. See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! pam Beesly. pam has been with us for. forever. Right, Pam?
pam Well. I don't know.
michael If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
pam What?
michael Any messages?
pam Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
michael Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
pam You haven't told me.
michael It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
michael People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious. " "And you get the best out of us. " I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
dwight Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum
jim My job is to speak to clients on the phone about. uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And. I'm boring myself just talking about this.
michael Whassup!
jim Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
michael Whassup!
dwight Whassup!
michael Whass. up!
dwight Whassup.
michael What?
jim Nothing.
michael OK. All right. See you later.
jim All right. Take care.
michael Back to work.
jan Just before lunch. That would be great.
michael Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. jan Levinson Gould. Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because. well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um. Yeah.
jan Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
michael Um. Me no get an agenda.
jan What? I'm sorry?
michael I didn't get any agenda.
jan Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
michael Really? I didn't. Did we get a fax this morning?
pam Uh, yeah, the one.
michael Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
pam You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
michael Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and. It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
jan Do you want to look at mine?
michael Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
jan OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
michael OK.
jan Michael, don't panic.
michael No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
jan No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made. We haven't decided.
michael All the alarm bells are kind of going. ringie-dingie-ding!
jan I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
michael OK. No problem.
jan This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
michael Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
michael Question. How long do we have to. Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
jan Go ahead.
michel Packman. Todd
packer Hey, you big queen.
michael Oh, that's not appropriate. Todd
packer Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
michael Uh, I don't know what you mean. Todd
packer I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
michael Oh, my God! Oh! That's. horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
jan So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
michael No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. Like that.
phyllis So what does downsizing actually mean?
stanley Well.
oscar You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.
angela I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.
kevin Yeah, it'll be you.
pam I have an important question for you.
jim Yes?
pam Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?
jim Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
michael Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.
michael Hey.
ryan Hey.
pam This is Mr. Scott.
michael Guilty! Guilty as charged!
ryan ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
michael Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
ryan Yup.
michael Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler.
pam I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might. I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um. Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, jim thinks they're good.
pam Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.
jim Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
dwight What?
jim What are you doing?
dwight Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
jim It's not on your desk.
dwight It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
dwight You can't do that.
jim Why not?
dwight Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
jim We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
dwight Downsizing?
dwight Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
pam You just still have these messages from yesterday.
michael Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.
pam What?
michael Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
pam Don't we all?
michael I'm sorry?
pam Nothing.
michael If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.
michael I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.
michael People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope. Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable. . push;
michael Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
dwight I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
michael Assistant to the Regional Manager.
dwight OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
michael I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
oscar Can't you just tell us.
dwight Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
michael You don't know what it is.
dwight OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
michael I don't need your permission.
dwight Go ahead.
michael Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
ryan I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.
oscar Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
michael Not gonna happen.
stanley It could be out of your hands Michael.
michael It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
stanley Can you promise that?
dwight On his mother's grave.
michael No.
phyllis What?
michael Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
stanley It's just that we need to know.
michael I know. Hold on a second. I think pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
pam I was in the meeting with jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
man Are you sure about that?
michael Well, pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
dwight Pam, information is power.
stanley You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
michael No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
jim If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.
pam jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um.
michael Watch out for this guy. dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
ryan What's up? Nice to meet you.
michael Introduce yourself. Be polite.
dwight dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
michael Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
dwight Uh. yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1, 200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
michael That's his profit.
dwight New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
dwight Damn it! Jim!
michael OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
dwight He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
pam 
dwight That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
dwight It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
michael What is that?
dwight That is my stapler.
michael No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
dwight OK you know what, you can be a witness. Can you reprimand him?
jim How do you know it was me?
dwight It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
michael Discipline. Kinky! All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
dwight Yeah.
michael And yeah, jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
jim OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
michael Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
ryan You should've put him in custardy.
michael Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
dwight OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
michael Pudding. Pudding. I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
jim Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?
pam Yeah.
jim That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
pam So when are we going out?
jim Tonight, hopefully.
pam OK. Yeah.
roy Hey, man.
jim What's going on?
roy Hey, baby.
pam Hey.
pam Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.
pam Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?
roy No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.
pam OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.
jim You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
roy It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.
jim Yeah, yeah.
jim Um. What's in the bag?
roy Just tell her I'll talk to her later.
jim No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
jim Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding?
michael So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second. and probably an entertainer third. Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
ryan Yeah.
michael You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
ryan All right.
michael Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to.
pam You got a fax.
michael Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
pam What? Why?
michael Why? Well, theft and stealing.
pam Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
michael Post-it Notes.
pam Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
michael 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit. margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
pam Are you serious?
michael Yeah. I am.
pam I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
michael But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and. Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
michael You been X'd punk! Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you. God, we totally got you.
pam You're a jerk.
michael I don't know about that.
michael What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, "Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.
pam Hey.
jim Hey.
jim How are things?
pam Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with.
jim Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
pam It's better, thanks.
jim Good. Good.
pam Yeah.
jim That's great
pam Is. ?
jim Yeah?
pam Um. Are you.
jim Am I walking out?
pam Yes.
jim Yes, I. Do you want to.
pam Yeah.
jim Great. Let me just.
jim Oh, Roy.
pam Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.
jim Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. You know what, just come here.
