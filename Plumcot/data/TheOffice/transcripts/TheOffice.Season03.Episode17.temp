michael Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
kevin My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
michael Huh?
kevin I almost died. I. I went into this skid---
michael Pop quiz.
kevin . What?
michael Why is today a special day?
kevin I almost died.
michael Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a. visiting. professor, special lecturer, emeritus. how did you, how did you.
ryan You will be a guest speaker. in my Emerging Enterprises class.
michael In business school, Kevin. Business school.
kevin Wow.
ryan If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So. I'd be stupid not to do it, right?
michael A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um. and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. . Really ruined eighth grade for us.
michael Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our. A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
dwight "Don't be an idiot. " Changed my life.
dwight Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.
michael Will they throw their hats, you think?
ryan What?
michael A lot of times, at a. school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
ryan Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
michael Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for
that "May your hats fly as high as your dreams. " . That was a pretty good line.
ryan . It doesn't apply.
michael I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! Whoa, hey!
ryan Quit it!
michael We have fun.
roy I can't for your art show tonight.
pam Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
roy I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
pam Thanks.
pam I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. . Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
roy Love ya.
pam You too.
jim Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.

kelly Oh my God. You're so in love now.
pam Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
kelly Oh, art show!
pam I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
kelly . Oh. yeah. Definitely. I'll be there. For sure.
michael Campus. Brings back so many memories. . That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? Whoo! College
student . . Dude.
dwight . Oh my God. Animal stool.
pam Dwight, what are you doing?
dwight Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
karen Oh my God!
dwight BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
stanley Goooood bye.
angela . Please don't let that stupid thing near me.
michael Okay, this is it. ryan is doing my intro right now.
ryan . Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off.
michael I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
dwight We have. a bat. in the office.
toby The simple solution would be to open a window. if we had. windows that could open.
angela Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
jim Okay. Thanks. Animal control will be here at six.
dwight At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
jim I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd.
dwight What? What's so wierd?
jim The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so. tingly. so strangely powerful. Oh well.
ryan And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, michael Scott.
michael Hello everyone, I am michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have. a book. that is worth its weight in gold. I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of
business Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
dwight This is your job, Halpert.
jim Ow!
karen Oh, what happened?
jim That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
karen But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
jim What? . No. It burned me. I. bizarre.
dwight No. no. One crisis at a time.
dwight If a vampire bat was in the U. S, it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania. " Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
michael So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be. a. thingamajig. Or a. a whosi-whatsi. Or. a Whatchamacallit . Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay . And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand . Satisfied?
toby Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. . Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
pam Oh! No, you should go.
toby Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
michael Okay, I'm seeing some confused. faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
ryan Michael.
michael . And products!
ryan What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
michael Well. okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up. Business student #1
 Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
michael We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.
karen Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
jim Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
karen What glare?
jim The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding. . push;
dwight I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
dwight Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
creed Sure.
dwight --to use sudden violence.
creed Okay.
dwight Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
creed What size? Business student #2
 What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
michael . I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back. Business student #2
 Has anyone ever come back?
michael . We don't want them back, 'cause they're. stupid. Business student #3
 How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
michael Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index? Business student #3
 . What?
michael Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here? Business student #1
 By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
michael . Wait, ryan said that?
kelly What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
creed Animals can't feel pain.
kelly Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
dwight Flush him towards the door. On my go. NOW!
kelly AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
kevin I. am a hero!
michael Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay. Business student #2
 But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
michael David will always beat Goliath. Business student #1
 But there's five Goliaths, there's. Staples, Officemax.
michael Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators. mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school? Business student #1
 But in the big picture.
michael Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan. has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. SO SUCK ON THAT!
ryan . It wasn't personal.
michael Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
ryan Pack my--?
michael You heard me, pack your things.
meredith I really want to come out!
creed Good night, Mary Beth!
jim So. you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
dwight Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
jim Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades. there's just so much sun in here. bye Dwight.
dwight Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
dwight jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
pam . And it's all from the same series.
woman Oh.
pam Called 'Impressions. '
woman Oh.
pam Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
woman Maybe one day.
pam I hope so.

pam Hey, Kenny.
kenny Hey Pam.
roy How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's. pretty cool, huh?

meredith Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!

pam Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.
roy To my place?
pam Maybe, I'm a little tired.
roy Your art. was the prettiest art of. all art.
pam Thank you.
ryan Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and. of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
michael Fire you? No, no no. You are moving. to the annex.
ryan To the annex? Where. kelly is?
michael A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. . People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
oscar You're the one who said we needed more culture.
gil This is culture to you?
oscar It's her first try.
gil Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.
oscar Meaning what?
gil Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.
oscar Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
gil Yeah, exactly. That's why this is. motel art.
artist Thanks for coming.
michael Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
pam Oh, Michael.

michael Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my. window, and there's my car! That your car?
pam Uh-huh.

pam . Thank you.
michael What?
pam Do you have something in your pocket?
michael . Chunky. Do you want half?
pam No thank you.
michael Okay.
michael It is. a message. It is an inspiration, it is. a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
kelly Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
ryan It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
kelly I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't.
