michael_scott Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. Do you know who that is?
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
jim_halpert Is he you?
michael_scott I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
jim_halpert Where did you take that?
michael_scott In my condo complex.
jim_halpert Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
michael_scott I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
jim_halpert Sure. That they should do one.
michael_scott Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
jim_halpert Who's that?
michael_scott Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
jim_halpert John Dillinger.
michael_scott No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
jim_halpert Captain Crunch.
michael_scott Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
jim_halpert At the Yankees game. Yeah.
michael_scott Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
jim_halpert I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
michael_scott I know, I know.
jim_halpert ...in your condo complex.
michael_scott I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
jim_halpert M. Night Shulman?
michael_scott First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
stanley_hudson When are we getting to sales topics?
dwight_schrute Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
michael_scott Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. No, no, meeting's not over.
phyllis_vance But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
michael_scott No sales topic per se.
andy_bernard Well then no Andy Bernard per se.
michael_scott Dwight?
dwight_schrute Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
michael_scott I would like your undivided attention, please.
dwight_schrute You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
michael_scott Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
dwight_schrute Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute When I was asking about the leads.
michael_scott M-hmm.
dwight_schrute ... is there any news on the leads?
michael_scott Is that all you have to say to me?
dwight_schrute Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! Alright, Dwight out!
dwight_schrute Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
angela_martin Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
phyllis_vance Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
michael_scott Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque.
jim_halpert Oh, sorry, wait one second.
michael_scott Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
jim_halpert This is actually a big potential sale, so...
michael_scott You writing your memoirs over there?
jim_halpert You writing your name over there?
michael_scott Well, it's a pretty big check.
jim_halpert That's good. You know, with the kid.
michael_scott Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
jim_halpert Alright, here we go. Michael...
michael_scott I'm just saying, that -
jim_halpert Michael - Great.
andy_bernard Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... I'm making a sale. Sales.
darryl_philbin There's other pencil's in this office.
andy_bernard Give me that
michael_scott Honey and jelly sandwich time.
darryl_philbin Michael.
michael_scott Oh, you got to be kidding me. Look at that. That's -
darryl_philbin I know who did that.
michael_scott You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
darryl_philbin Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
michael_scott The sales department smashed my sandwich.
darryl_philbin Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
michael_scott You don't get it.
darryl_philbin You need to get back on top.
michael_scott That's what she said.
darryl_philbin Yeah.
michael_scott Yeah.
erin_hannon Something came for you, Michael.
michael_scott Thank you very much.
jim_halpert What'd you get?
michael_scott Ah, just the stupid leads.
jim_halpert Alright!
stanley_hudson About time.
andy_bernard Me likey!
phyllis_vance Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
michael_scott Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you.
stanley_hudson We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
gabe_lewis Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
michael_scott Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
gabe_lewis Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
michael_scott They act like I have no power.
gabe_lewis But you do. You are in charge -
michael_scott Thank you.
gabe_lewis - of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
michael_scott Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
gabe_lewis Okay, good.
michael_scott Exactly that.
gabe_lewis Good.
michael_scott Exactly that.
gabe_lewis Why do you keep repeating -
michael_scott Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed!
phyllis_vance What are you -
michael_scott - and to King Meredith!
stanley_hudson They aren't salespeople!
michael_scott And to King Angela! Because today we are all kings. And queens .
phyllis_vance What the hell do you think you're doing?
michael_scott I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott Hey.
jim_halpert So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
michael_scott Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
michael_scott Okay.
jim_halpert Hey, alright.
michael_scott Alright.
jim_halpert Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
michael_scott Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
jim_halpert I don't think you understand -
michael_scott I do understand it.
jim_halpert This one's a map.
michael_scott Or is it?
angela_martin Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
phyllis_vance Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
angela_martin I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work
phyllis_vance What are these for?
angela_martin It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
kelly_kapoor I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
ryan_howard It's my -
stanley_hudson The Kardashians is a good show.
ryan_howard No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
kelly_kapoor It's about a family. A real-life family.
ryan_howard No, Stanley, do you -
pam_beesly Hey baby, what's up?
jim_halpert I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
pam_beesly Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
jim_halpert Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
jim_halpert Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies - that's just unfair.
jim_halpert How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
pam_beesly He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
jim_halpert I love you.
michael_scott Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing Some people shouldn't be in this business.
andy_bernard Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
erin_hannon Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. I hid the leads.
andy_bernard Where?
erin_hannon Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
andy_bernard Are you...
erin_hannon Lower.
andy_bernard Are you sure?
erin_hannon Lower
dwight_schrute What are you doing, idiot?
jim_halpert Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
dwight_schrute Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
jim_halpert Lincoln.
dwight_schrute The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
jim_halpert It involves you too.
dwight_schrute The leads are in?
dwight_schrute Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
michael_scott Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
dwight_schrute Kevin! Damnit Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
kevin_malone You are never going to find them.
dwight_schrute Really.
kevin_malone I'm going to enjoy this.
dwight_schrute Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
kevin_malone I'm still enjoying it.
dwight_schrute Where are they?
kevin_malone Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
dwight_schrute Turn the trash It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
meredith_palmer Okey-dokey.
kevin_malone No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
meredith_palmer It's coming off anyway.
dwight_schrute Clean sack.
kevin_malone What -
erin_hannon I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
toby_flenderson If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
dwight_schrute It's empty!
michael_scott Wait. What day is today?
kevin_malone Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
michael_scott Oh my god. Oh my god oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey wait, wait!
michael_scott Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -
phyllis_vance Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
michael_scott Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump."
stanley_hudson Not your staff, Michael. You.
michael_scott Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
toby_flenderson Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
michael_scott Really?
angela_martin I'm not going. You did this, not us.
michael_scott Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit Complicit. You were all successories!
darryl_philbin That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
michael_scott You can.
darryl_philbin I can't. You know that.
michael_scott Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
dwight_schrute I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
dwight_schrute This place has gone to hell.
michael_scott You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
dwight_schrute Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
michael_scott Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
kelly_kapoor You're adorable. You need to go for it. I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
jim_halpert Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
kelly_kapoor Why?
jim_halpert Just all the - drama.
kelly_kapoor What drama?
jim_halpert Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
kelly_kapoor So unnecessary.
jim_halpert Oh, good, phew, thank god you said that.
kelly_kapoor I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
jim_halpert I have new baby pictures.
kelly_kapoor Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
jim_halpert She's wearing a onesie
stanley_hudson If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
jim_halpert Didn't we kind of start it?
phyllis_vance I think you're remembering that wrong?
andy_bernard Yeah.
phyllis_vance I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
jim_halpert Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
andy_bernard All those who agree, say aye All those opposed -
jim_halpert I don't think we need opposed.
michael_scott You've changed, man.
dwight_schrute Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
michael_scott Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
dwight_schrute Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
michael_scott No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
dwight_schrute When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
michael_scott Assistant to the managed him -
dwight_schrute Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
michael_scott You think you would have done better without me? Really?
dwight_schrute I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
michael_scott Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
dwight_schrute Kung-fu movies!
michael_scott You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
dwight_schrute Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
michael_scott That's my wife you're talking about, man.
dwight_schrute Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? You watch it!
michael_scott If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
dwight_schrute Don't do it
michael_scott No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. No, time out, time out. Time in!
dwight_schrute No!
michael_scott Don't even think about that
dwight_schrute Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
phyllis_vance What's the least we can do to make this okay?
jim_halpert I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
andy_bernard And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
phyllis_vance I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
stanley_hudson That is a dangerous precedent.
jim_halpert Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
phyllis_vance Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
jim_halpert Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
phyllis_vance Okay, fine. Cash it is.
andy_bernard Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches".
michael_scott Okay, Dwight. Here we go oh god.
dwight_schrute Oh
michael_scott We're never going to find those leads, are we?
dwight_schrute Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
phyllis_vance So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
jim_halpert No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay Hey everybody!
meredith_palmer Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
jim_halpert No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is really sorry.
andy_bernard Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
phyllis_vance Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...
oscar_martinez Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
kevin_malone Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
angela_martin Do you have any pastries without fruit?
jim_halpert Yes! We do. Eclairs.
stanley_hudson Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
jim_halpert - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
phyllis_vance Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
stanley_hudson This is - nice! All of us back together.
michael_scott This Why would somebody throw that out?
dwight_schrute Hey You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
michael_scott Yeah, she does - she loves purple. Does it stink?
dwight_schrute Yeah
michael_scott Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read
dwight_schrute Hope - grows.
michael_scott In the dump.
dwight_schrute Woo hoo!
stanley_hudson Good news that you found our leads?
michael_scott No! Better!
dwight_schrute We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.
phyllis_vance Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
dwight_schrute Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only
andy_bernard It's freezing out here.
erin_hannon Go on. I have warm blood.
andy_bernard Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met.
