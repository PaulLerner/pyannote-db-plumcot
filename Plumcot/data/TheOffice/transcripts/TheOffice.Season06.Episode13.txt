dwight_schrute Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
jim_halpert Too loud.
dwight_schrute --the party planning committee...
jim_halpert Too, too loud. Too Loud.
dwight_schrute But effective, look! On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
all@ Merry Christmas.
dwight_schrute Merry Christmas. Good.
dwight_schrute My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
dwight_schrute It is time to unveil the tree.
oscar_martinez Hey, Rockefeller Center!
jim_halpert Yeah.
ryan_howard Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
jim_halpert This is all we have.
ryan_howard Ugh.
jim_halpert No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie.
dwight_schrute It is warm feelings.
meredith_palmer Why don't we talk more about it instead of doing it?
dwight_schrute Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!
jim_halpert Why would you start so high?
dwight_schrute Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
jim_halpert Three, two, one!
phyllis_vance Ooh.
pam_beesly Ah!
phyllis_vance You didn't decorate it?
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Exactly.
jim_halpert We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
dwight_schrute Everyone.
andy_bernard Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?
pam_beesly Is it, is it fake?
jim_halpert Pam!
dwight_schrute Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
jim_halpert Yes.
dwight_schrute Like the spirit of Christmas!
stanley_hudson We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
dwight_schrute This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
erin_hannon Hello. Sorry guys. Sorry guys. I'm not sure I've earned the right to make announcements yet. But whoever is giving me the Twelve Days of Christmas? As my Secret Santa? Please stop. I can't take it anymore. My cat killed a turtledove; the French hens have started pulling out my hair to make a nest. Please. Stop.
kelly_kapoor What psycho would send that as a gift?
andy_bernard I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds?
phyllis_vance Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas boys and girls! It's me, Santa Claus!
dwight_schrute Hey Santa!
oscar_martinez They finally let you do it!
phyllis_vance Yeah!
kevin_malone Congrats Phil!
erin_hannon It's so edgy!
phyllis_vance I have been wanting to be Santa for years. I believe I have the right temperament, and the figure to do the job well. I slipped a note to Jim eleven weeks ago, and he said I could do it. It's been a long journey... but I'm Santa Claus!
pam_beesly So Santa, what can we expect from this party?
phyllis_vance It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
creed_bratton What if you've been bad?
phyllis_vance Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
creed_bratton What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
jim_halpert Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
phyllis_vance Yeah.
dwight_schrute For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
pam_beesly You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!
oscar_martinez That's funny.
pam_beesly Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. I think my water just broke!
oscar_martinez That's too funny.
pam_beesly Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!
michael_scott Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see.
pam_beesly Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
michael_scott What the hell is going on?
michael_scott Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Phyllis?
jim_halpert Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
michael_scott Take it back. That is absurd.
jim_halpert No, I'm not gonna do that.
michael_scott No? No! Jim! Come on!
jim_halpert I think she's doing a good job.
michael_scott It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
jim_halpert I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
michael_scott Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
michael_scott If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably "freedom." At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.
michael_scott Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!
all@ Okay...
michael_scott No it's not, not like penis-wise. Hello little boy, what's your name?
kevin_malone Michael it's me, Kevin. Phyllis says I'm too big for her lap.
michael_scott Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
kevin_malone When can I sit on your lap?
michael_scott Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. Oh my God.
kevin_malone That's really comfortable.
michael_scott What would you like for Christmas little boy?
kevin_malone I don't know. I didn't know you were gonna ask me that.
michael_scott What did you think was going to happen?
kevin_malone I didn't know. Nobody's ever let me sit on their lap before.
michael_scott All right, just say "some toys" please.
kevin_malone Can you give me some choices? Cause I really don't want to mess up on this list.
michael_scott Damn it Kevin, come on.
kevin_malone What about if I tell you the things I don't want?
michael_scott Okay get off, get off! Oh! Oh, God!
kevin_malone I didn't even get to tell you what I wanted!
michael_scott Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
kevin_malone Awesome.
phyllis_vance Well?
jim_halpert I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
phyllis_vance The only Santa.
jim_halpert That's what I want.
phyllis_vance You promised me this. Don't make me get Bob involved!
jim_halpert What would Bob do?
phyllis_vance Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.
andy_bernard Does it hurt?
erin_hannon It stings a lot.
andy_bernard Hmm.
erin_hannon I keep trying to figure out who's sending me these gifts.
andy_bernard I know, right?
erin_hannon So far no one will admit to it.
andy_bernard Huh!
erin_hannon Is it you?
andy_bernard Yeah! Totally! I admit it! It's me.
erin_hannon Seriously?
andy_bernard "Seriously?" Are you serious?
erin_hannon What?
andy_bernard Yeah! Totally serious! I'm your Secret Santa! Busted!
oscar_martinez There he is.
darryl_philbin Hey.
oscar_martinez Is Matt around? I got his check.
darryl_philbin Uh, Matt is on a delivery. Just leave it here, I'll take it.
oscar_martinez Ah, I'll just... wait for him.
darryl_philbin Matt's a pretty good-looking dude, don't you think?
oscar_martinez I'll just leave it here with you.
michael_scott Ryan come here!
ryan_howard Whoa, whoa.
michael_scott Come on, come on.
ryan_howard I'm doing something over here.
michael_scott Ahhh... Ho ho ho! Come on I need this. Come over here!
ryan_howard What are you talking about?
michael_scott Just sit down!
ryan_howard No no no.
jim_halpert Hey hey hey. Everything okay?
michael_scott Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
jim_halpert Can I just talk to you for a second?
michael_scott Whoop! Okay, what?
jim_halpert You can't yell out "I need this, I need this" as you pin down an employee on your lap!
michael_scott Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
jim_halpert Yup.
michael_scott Do you understand, you forced my hand?
jim_halpert Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
michael_scott Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it?
jim_halpert Great!
michael_scott Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
jim_halpert Who wants Phyllis as Santa?
michael_scott No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
kevin_malone Michael I had you. I just want to try Phyllis.
jim_halpert And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. Can I get you some punch?
michael_scott I'll get some punch. That looks delicious.
Office#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode13 Aw, Michael!
dwight_schrute Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
phyllis_vance How do you know it's a gun?
dwight_schrute What else does it look like?
stanley_hudson Not a gun.
dwight_schrute Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
stanley_hudson Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
dwight_schrute Not a gun.
phyllis_vance In the North Pole I spend many nights alone tinkering with toys. So today, let's put a twinkle in Ole Kris Kringle's eye! Let the party begin!
michael_scott I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. "Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself." That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me? Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.
michael_scott Behold! Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas. Those of you who wish to join me, that's great. I'm excited by that. And those of you who don't, I forgive you. But I never forget.
toby_flenderson Wow Michael, like this must be obvious how wrong this is.
michael_scott Oh the Anti-Christ!
toby_flenderson You can't, Ow. Look, you cannot push religion.
michael_scott Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
toby_flenderson No!
michael_scott Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
andy_bernard Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?
phyllis_vance All right sweetie, I'll tell her its Michael.
andy_bernard Okay.
kelly_kapoor and Erin I saw three ships come sailing in, on Christmas day, on Christmas day...
pam_beesly Have you talked to him?
oscar_martinez Who?
pam_beesly Matt?
oscar_martinez Is it that obvious? No- hey...
pam_beesly Mmm! Good pate, right? Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?
matt I don't think so.
pam_beesly Hey, Oscar, come here. Oscar, this is Matt, and um, Matt loves your pate.
matt I had some.
pam_beesly Oscar's pate is great. I could eat it all day, every day. Mmm. How come the good ones are never straight, right?
oscar_martinez Okay Pam.
pam_beesly Okay.
pam_beesly Yes! They're the only two gay guys I know. But they should be together.
phyllis_vance This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
dwight_schrute We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot.
michael_scott Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
phyllis_vance Ho ho ho! For Stanley! Ho ho ho! You've been very good this year -
stanley_hudson I have.
michael_scott Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?
kevin_malone He got scented candles!
michael_scott Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.
angela_martin Amen.
phyllis_vance And this brings us to you, little one.
michael_scott I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up.
angela_martin It's fabric! I really wanted this.
michael_scott That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
angela_martin Andy, is this you?
michael_scott No!
phyllis_vance It's a secret.
michael_scott Andy had Erin.
andy_bernard Nnnnya.
michael_scott What? Was I not supposed to say it? What? Turn it back on.
jim_halpert No.
david_wallace Yes Michael, what is so urgent?
michael_scott David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.
david_wallace I'm not going to guess. You can tell me or I am going to hang up.
michael_scott I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
david_wallace Michael...
michael_scott I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
david_wallace Michael-
michael_scott What?
david_wallace This is a very very bad time.
michael_scott Really? What's going on?
david_wallace Stephanie, can you hop off please?
stephanie Sure David.
michael_scott What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
erin_hannon Do you want me off the call too Michael?
michael_scott Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
david_wallace Listen, I shouldn't tell you this, but the company has a buyer. The board will have no choice to approve. They are going to clean house.
michael_scott What does that mean?
david_wallace I'll be fired.
michael_scott Well, can't Alan protect you?
david_wallace Alan will be out too. All of us.
michael_scott All of us?
david_wallace Goodbye Michael.
michael_scott Oh my God.
michael_scott Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.
michael_scott Hey. How's everybody doing?
jim_halpert Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
michael_scott That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
angela_martin Are you serious? This is so offensive.
michael_scott You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
dwight_schrute What's your pin number?
michael_scott I don't want to say. But, "it's fun to stay at the -"
michael_scott "It's fun to stay at the -"
dwight_schrute Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
michael_scott Mmm, mm mm mm.
andy_bernard I, I thought that you would like it.
erin_hannon It was a little much Andy.
andy_bernard Well it's the thought that counts.
erin_hannon What were you thinking?
andy_bernard I suppose a gentlemen might... throw in the towel, at this point. Guess what? Not gonna happen.
michael_scott You know what, Christmas isn't about Santa, or Jesus. It's about the workplace. All of you feel like my family. Ryan, you are my son. And Pam, you're my wife. And Jim. And Angela and Phyllis, you are my Grandmas. And Stanley, you're our mailman. And I can't help but look at all your wonderful beautiful faces and think, "How could they do this to us?"
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly How could we do what?
michael_scott It's not... Nevermind. Nothing.
stanley_hudson We deserve to know.
michael_scott I didn't say anything!
angela_martin If you know something Michael...
michael_scott We're going out of business!
all@ WHAT?
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute You are kidding me!
jim_halpert Wait wait wait, who said that?
michael_scott David told me on the phone. David told me.
dwight_schrute When? When did he tell you? Today?
michael_scott Earlier today.
dwight_schrute Awww!
michael_scott He said, we have been sold.
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute Aaaarrhh!
michael_scott Dwight! Jesus!
angela_martin Come on!
jim_halpert Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
michael_scott David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
jim_halpert Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
michael_scott It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
meredith_palmer No, I get it.
michael_scott I'll call him. I'll call David.
jim_halpert No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
michael_scott Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
michael_scott He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.
david_wallace Hey Sweetie, what is it?
michael_scott It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott.
david_wallace What the hell?
michael_scott Stephanie could you hop off please?
david_wallace Michael, I have never-
michael_scott David!
david_wallace Ever, ever...
michael_scott David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
dwight_schrute Hey David.
kelly_kapoor Hi David!
david_wallace Hello everyone.
michael_scott David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
david_wallace You weren't supposed to tell anyone Michael.
michael_scott Well I think we're past that now.
david_wallace I am not supposed to... Okay. Guys. I was really only talking about Alan, myself, a few other execs you don't know.
jim_halpert Oh my God, David. That's horrible.
meredith_palmer How 'bout us? It's Meredith. By the way, your wife is a very lucky woman.
david_wallace Look. They're buying the company for the distribution. You guys are the only thing about this company that works. So congratulations.
michael_scott We're not fired?
david_wallace No! No, and congratulations.
michael_scott Yeah! It's a Christmas miracle!
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott Woo hoo!
dwight_schrute I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone.
dwight_schrute It's true. We all walk alone.
kelly_kapoor Jim.... Jim!
dwight_schrute My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
toby_flenderson Wow! Cause...
ryan_howard Yeah! That was the idea.
toby_flenderson Thank you!
ryan_howard Awesome!
toby_flenderson Thanks man!
kevin_malone Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree, thy leaves are so unchanging...
michael_scott Oh! You got it? What is that?
dwight_schrute I have no idea.
michael_scott Huh. Well, maybe those will help.
dwight_schrute Michael? Please! Come on!
matt Nice to meet you Oscar.
oscar_martinez Nice to meet you Mark!
matt It's Matt.
oscar_martinez Right, Matt. I know what I'm doing, Pam.
dwight_schrute Oh man! I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
michael_scott Hi Santa.
phyllis_vance Hi Michael. Mm. 'kay.
michael_scott I'd like to make a wish.
phyllis_vance What?
michael_scott I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry.
phyllis_vance An Xbox it is. Because I've decided you're a good boy.
bob_vance Vance Scott! What in the hell is going on here?
phyllis_vance No Bob, we worked it out.
michael_scott You called Bob?
phyllis_vance I'm sorry,
michael_scott Come on! Phyllis!
phyllis_vance I'm really sorry. It was earlier today.
michael_scott Okay.
phyllis_vance Hi sweetie.
bob_vance You okay baby?
phyllis_vance I'm good baby.
michael_scott Oh God. Get a room Santas!
michael_scott Thank you Santa. Happy Holidays.
dwight_schrute It's real slippery out here.
jim_halpert Oh my God!
pam_beesly Twelve drummers drumming.
andy_bernard Merry Christmas Erin! Take it away boys!
