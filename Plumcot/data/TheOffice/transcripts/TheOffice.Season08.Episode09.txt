dwight_schrute Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
dwight_schrute Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
dwight_schrute Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.
creed_bratton No. No. No. You're way off on that one.
dwight_schrute Oh yeah?
oscar_martinez Are you really comfortable standing there? I tried one of those and I just never hit the sweet spot.
jim_halpert Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?
dwight_schrute That's right Jim.
darryl_philbin Hey man.
dwight_schrute Hey.
darryl_philbin Taking a load off huh?
dwight_schrute No. Putting a load on more like it.
darryl_philbin Good luck with that.
dwight_schrute Last thing I need is luck.
dwight_schrute Thank you so much.
jim_halpert What are you up to? Oops look out!
dwight_schrute What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
jim_halpert Prank!
dwight_schrute Oh that's real creative.
jim_halpert You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
dwight_schrute I could, but I just don't feel like it loser.
jim_halpert Because you're sitting?
dwight_schrute Standing.
jim_halpert Ok.
dwight_schrute Don't!
jim_halpert Because you're sitting?
dwight_schrute Standing.
jim_halpert You know I have to do this.
dwight_schrute I know.
andy_bernard Andrew... Baines... Bernard.
jim_halpert I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
andy_bernard Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers.
robert_california In four seconds my wife is going to be coming through that door. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen. There you are! Honey how on earth could you miss the elevator?
andy_bernard What was that?
jim_halpert I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.
ryan_howard That's why my foundation – The Dream for a Wish Foundation – is going to put them out of business. They're not going to know what hit them.
robert_california Everyone. I'd like to introduce my wife Mrs. Robert California. Mrs. California this is everyone.
mrs_california Hello. Oh call me Susan please.
robert_california Last night at dinner Susan and I were talking about her returning to work. So she's here today to see if there's a good fit. Something tells me it just might work out. This is Andy Bernard the regional manager.
mrs_california Hello nice to meet you.
andy_bernard Hey there. It's a pleasure.
robert_california Andy would you be so kind as to show Susan around the office. Show her the various departments. Find a place where she'll shine.
andy_bernard I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100 percent staffed up.
robert_california Andy. Let's see if there's a good fit first. Then we'll talk.
andy_bernard Alright.
dwight_schrute Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
darryl_philbin You don't have to say it if you're doing it.
dwight_schrute Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
darryl_philbin Uh weight lifting yeah.
dwight_schrute Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
darryl_philbin I'll take a look.
dwight_schrute Your path from obesity begins right here!
darryl_philbin I've been meaning to join a gym. For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
dwight_schrute Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
andy_bernard Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.
mrs_california Well it was really nice to meet you Brian.
ryan_howard Actually Ryan.
mrs_california Oh, Ryan.
ryan_howard Bitttch!
andy_bernard We will start here at Erinville.
mrs_california Hi.
erin_hannon Hoo-hoo!
andy_bernard Reception. Your classic one-man operation.
erin_hannon Although I was watching a movie and Merryl Streep had two secretaries.
andy_bernard I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.
robert_california Two secretaries could convey a sense of importance and success to our clients. Certainly worth exploring; wouldn't you agree Andy?
andy_bernard I'll explore exploring it.
robert_california Good. It seems like you have this under control. So I'll just duck out and run the company for a while.
andy_bernard Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. Alright have at it. Let ‘er rip. What do you hate about this place?
jim_halpert Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
dwight_schrute Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
andy_bernard Jim?
jim_halpert Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.
dwight_schrute It's the second easiest job in the world. Being a mom.
mrs_california I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
dwight_schrute That is true.
andy_bernard You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
dwight_schrute That's me.
andy_bernard Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
dwight_schrute Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale .
mrs_california Well make that a red wine and I'll tell you my animal rankings .
andy_bernard Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? . The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.
dwight_schrute Ready? What do you think?
darryl_philbin Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
dwight_schrute You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month...
darryl_philbin Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
dwight_schrute Darryl...
darryl_philbin Make a real gym.
mrs_california I was thinking accounting might be a good fit because I really clicked with Oscar and I do have some experience in bookkeeping.
andy_bernard But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.
mrs_california Uh I could work in customer service. HR even.
andy_bernard Those are fully staffed as well.
robert_california Are you telling me that there's no one in this entire office that could use an extra pair of hands?
andy_bernard Yes.
robert_california I am the CEO and I am telling an employee of mine what to do.
andy_bernard Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
mrs_california Robert this is very uncomfortable. Obviously there's no place for me here. So thank you for trying. Why don't we just let it go.
robert_california No. Absolutely not. Andrew there must be something you can do. Think.
andy_bernard There are lots of considerations.
robert_california I would be eternally grateful. It's not a bad thing to have the CEO owe you one.
andy_bernard Alright. Well then welcome aboard.
mrs_california So what happens next?
andy_bernard We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. Hang on. Hello?
robert_california Say hello grandma.
andy_bernard Hi gam-gam.
robert_california Hold one finger up to Susan. You'll just be a second. You numbskull. You were given a very simple task. I could not have been more clear with you. Now say, "are you taking your medicine?"
andy_bernard Are you taking your med-meds?
robert_california Why can you not say exactly what I tell you? Undo this. Undo it.
mrs_california You didn't say goodbye to your grandma.
andy_bernard We promised we'd never say goodbye.
dwight_schrute Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
oscar_martinez All I need is another gym. As if I don't have enough drama.
phyllis_vance We have a gym at home. It's called the bedroom.
oscar_martinez Who's spotting who? Don't use the bike in the corner. That's Bruce's. Jeremy says...
angela_martin Enough Oscar, enough.
dwight_schrute Kelly?
kelly_kapoor I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
dwight_schrute That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
toby_flenderson Did you bring your passport with you?
mrs_california Who walks around with their passport?
toby_flenderson Well, I do. Always ready for adventure.
mrs_california Have you had any?
toby_flenderson No.
andy_bernard Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.
oscar_martinez Andy, if he didn't want her working here then why did you hire her?
andy_bernard@oscar_martinez it was a mistake. But one that can be fixed by all of us being mean to her.
kevin_malone How can we do that? She's simply wonderful.
angela_martin This is all pathetic.
andy_bernard I am not asking, I am ordering.
oscar_martinez How mean are we talking about?
andy_bernard It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.
erin_hannon Got it. I know exactly which stapler to give her.
erin_hannon Here you go.
mrs_california Um, do you think it would be possible to move to that desk over there? Because this seems a bit cramped and I don't have a computer.
erin_hannon Well that's a sales desk.
kevin_malone Yeah. You need to be over here with us accountants. Just sit here and be quiet. And if you have a question, just raise your hand. But I'm gonna save you some time, sweetie, and give you the answer now. I. Don't. Know.
jim_halpert No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.
oscar_martinez That's Gerald.
jim_halpert Oh, wow. So cute.
mrs_california Oh, that is so cute-
phyllis_vance Aw... He's so tiny. Is he in a ladle?
oscar_martinez Yeah, he's in a ladle.
erin_hannon That's adorable. How on earth did you get him in a ladle?
oscar_martinez He did it himself.
phyllis_vance Is that ladle stainless or...
oscar_martinez Oh, stainless. Williams Sonoma.
mrs_california Excuse me, waiter, there's a dog in my soup.
oscar_martinez It's not that kind of ladle.
jim_halpert Very cute.
mrs_california Aw, let me see-
oscar_martinez Ah, just the battery on these things. I'm sorry, I've got to recharge this.
mrs_california I get it. Last time I had a job, I remember I hated the boss' wife. Of course, she was married to Robert.
mrs_california Your employees don't seem to be taking to me.
robert_california Andy! Andy, could you step in here, please? We'll fix this.
andy_bernard What is going on?
robert_california Please. Andrew, my wife... has brought up an issue that requires your attention. So, uh, if you'll excuse me, I should step out, get to the ATM before that homeless man sets up camp for the night.
andy_bernard Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?
mrs_california Do you not want me here?
andy_bernard Why would you say that?
mrs_california It's okay. I understand. I'm not sure how I would feel about having the boss' wife work for me either.
andy_bernard It's not that, exactly.
mrs_california But it is something.
andy_bernard Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.
mrs_california Why would you not want me working here?
andy_bernard I don't know.
mrs_california I think I understand what you're going through. My husband can be a very difficult man to read, can't he?
andy_bernard Yes! The dude is an enigma.
mrs_california Mm-hmm. So he is mixed up in this, isn't he?
andy_bernard Ah...
mrs_california Got it.
dwight_schrute What do you think you're doing?
darryl_philbin Getting my sweat on.
dwight_schrute I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
darryl_philbin I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
dwight_schrute I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
darryl_philbin No.
dwight_schrute Eight minutes!
darryl_philbin Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
dwight_schrute Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
darryl_philbin It's Lejon Brames.
dwight_schrute That's what I said.
darryl_philbin You know, get it right.
dwight_schrute I know.
andy_bernard Cameras...
robert_california Oh, still here. Terrific.
mrs_california Andy and I had a great conversation. And I just want to let you know that I am not going to be working here.
robert_california Well that's a shame.
andy_bernard It just was one of those things-
mrs_california Is it? Because we talked about it and it seems like that might be what you want. Which is fine.
robert_california Where did this come from? Did Andy say that?
mrs_california No, he did not, but I could tell he was struggling to understand what was expected of him.
robert_california What's the struggle? He made a great call, hired a great person.
mrs_california You sure about that?
robert_california Absolutely.
mrs_california No games?
robert_california No games.
mrs_california Because Andy seemed to think there was some information he was not able to share with me.
robert_california Okay, enough of this. I mean, really, enough. It's gotten way out of hand. Andrew, this is my wife. Whatever privacy you were trying to protect between us, I thank you for. But it is not welcome right now. Just be honest.
mrs_california Andy?
andy_bernard Yes?
mrs_california Why do you keep looking at my husband?
robert_california Andy, just answer the question.
andy_bernard No games?
robert_california No games.
andy_bernard Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, "in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen."
robert_california You lying son of a bitch!
robert_california Tell my wife you're lying.
andy_bernard I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.
mrs_california That's not true, is it?
andy_bernard No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.
robert_california This is preposterous.
mrs_california Robert...
robert_california Let's get Jim in here. Where's Jim?
erin_hannon He just rolled out and crawled out.
robert_california Can you call security, tell 'em to keep an eye out for him? Time to settle this.
jim_halpert Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay.
robert_california That's weird. Well, he's gotta be around here somewhere.
jim_halpert Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. Creed. I was never here, all right?
creed_bratton Okay. What about your friend?
jim_halpert Oh boy.
dwight_schrute This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
darryl_philbin Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
dwight_schrute First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
darryl_philbin Okay, I'm not doing that.
dwight_schrute Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
gabe_lewis I didn't know Darryl joined.
darryl_philbin Looks that way.
gabe_lewis Nice pelvic bowl. Deep.
robert_california Hello Jim.
andy_bernard No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!
robert_california So I think you know what we want to know.
jim_halpert Do I?
robert_california Yes.
jim_halpert I know, I do.
andy_bernard Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.
jim_halpert I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
mrs_california For God's sake, did Robert tell you that he didn't want me working here?
jim_halpert That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.
andy_bernard I think we've got ourselves an answer.
robert_california No.
andy_bernard That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.
jim_halpert Perfect!
mrs_california Jim...
jim_halpert Yes?
mrs_california Answer the question, please.
jim_halpert I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
robert_california All right. Thanks.
jim_halpert Yes. All right. Great.
andy_bernard Uh...
robert_california Yeah.
andy_bernard Yep.
mrs_california Thank you.
robert_california Heh.
mrs_california Andy.
andy_bernard Hey, Mrs. California.
mrs_california Hey. Uh, I'm sorry about the position you were put in today.
andy_bernard You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
mrs_california Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
andy_bernard Yeah.
mrs_california Well, different circumstances.
andy_bernard Yeah.
mrs_california Who knows?
andy_bernard Who knows?
mrs_california Maybe after all this settles down...
andy_bernard Totally.
mrs_california It's a date.
andy_bernard Hmm?
dwight_schrute You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
darryl_philbin This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
dwight_schrute Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
darryl_philbin Dwight, come back and spot me.
dwight_schrute All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
darryl_philbin To push this bar up.
dwight_schrute No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
darryl_philbin Help me!
dwight_schrute What do you want!?!
darryl_philbin To look good for Val!
dwight_schrute Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
