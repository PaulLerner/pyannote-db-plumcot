dwight_schrute Wow. Late every day this week.
pam_beesly We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...
dwight_schrute Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
jim_halpert Is there really?
dwight_schrute Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
dwight_schrute Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
jim_halpert Aaah!
mose Aaah!
dwight_schrute You remember my cousin Mose.
mose Welcome children.
pam_beesly Were you painting in the dark?
jim_halpert Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
dwight_schrute Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
pam_beesly I don't really think we need...
jim_halpert Oh... lets take the tour Pam.
pam_beesly Yeah.
dwight_schrute Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
jim_halpert These are actually forks and knives from the break room.
dwight_schrute Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
pam_beesly And a soy sauce packet.
dwight_schrute Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
jim_halpert Don't beat yourself up.
dwight_schrute We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
jim_halpert Who will be watching the children?
dwight_schrute No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
jim_halpert Prove it.
dwight_schrute What?
jim_halpert Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
dwight_schrute Oh no, no, no.
jim_halpert But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
dwight_schrute I promise you, that door locks!
toby_flenderson What's something that you...
michael_scott This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
michael_scott Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.
toby_flenderson Michael has been assigned six hours of mandatory counseling with a trained professional. I actually have a degree in social work. I mean, I know a lot of people would ask a few standard questions, and check off a few boxes, but I've got a chance to do some good here.
michael_scott I know what you want to ask me. "Did your mom ever see you naked?"
toby_flenderson We can do this with more privacy.
michael_scott So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
dwight_schrute Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
phyllis_vance The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
dwight_schrute All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
ryan_howard America is one big mall.
jim_halpert Did something happen Dwight?
dwight_schrute Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
andy_bernard Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
dwight_schrute You don't want to know.
toby_flenderson I'd like you to imagine a place where you feel very peaceful. For me, it's the walk from the yogurt shop to my car after I drop my daughter off on Sunday afternoons.
phyllis_vance I'm glad Michael is getting help. He as a lot of issues, and he's stupid.
pam_beesly Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.
jim_halpert Pam?
pam_beesly I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.
jim_halpert Everything is going to be ok.
pam_beesly Tell me I'm good at sales.
jim_halpert You're good... you're good at sales.
pam_beesly The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.
andy_bernard Dwight?
dwight_schrute What?
andy_bernard Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word?
dwight_schrute Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
stanley_hudson No you will not.
dwight_schrute Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists!
jim_halpert Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
pam_beesly Yeah, what happened Dwight?
jim_halpert Ok.
dwight_schrute You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
pam_beesly So what happened?
dwight_schrute I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
kelly_kapoor You know what Dwight? You need to go back there, and you need to "Pretty Woman" their asses.
creed_bratton We should start our own mall!
erin_hannon Yeah!
jim_halpert Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
kelly_kapoor What did I say?
kelly_kapoor I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out.
jim_halpert Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.
andy_bernard No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.
dwight_schrute Ok
jim_halpert Alright.
andy_bernard Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? How about now? How about now? How about now?
toby_flenderson Uh... what was your favorite flavor of...
michael_scott One hour.
toby_flenderson What?
michael_scott One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
toby_flenderson Ok, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.
michael_scott No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
toby_flenderson Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...
michael_scott You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
toby_flenderson Tell me!
toby_flenderson I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.
michael_scott Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
dwight_schrute Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
andy_bernard Pretty Woman.
dwight_schrute Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this s*x worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
jim_halpert No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
dwight_schrute Ok, Um... The s*x worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
andy_bernard Julia Roberts goes into the store, and she's like," I was in here yesterday and you wouldn't help me." And the shop girl goes, "ok". And Julia Roberts goes," You girls work on commission, right?" And the girl is like,"Yeah", and Julia Roberts goes...
kelly_kapoor "Big mistake! Huge!"
andy_bernard I was telling that... I was telling that.
stanley_hudson How many paper supplies and ink cartridges to go with that? Ok, sure.
Window#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode02 treatment guy Who can I speak to in this office about saving on window treatments?
erin_hannon I don't know.
Window#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode02 treatment guy Is one of you the office administrator?
pam_beesly I am. I am the office administrator!
Window#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode02 treatment guy Can I show you a few samples?
pam_beesly Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.
pam_beesly There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.
michael_scott Toby, can I really tell you anything?
toby_flenderson Of course.
michael_scott Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my pen1s... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
oscar_martinez Office Administrator. So when did this happen?
pam_beesly A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?
oscar_martinez Yeah, totally. Well, congrats!
pam_beesly Thanks! Yeah, so I'm just going to take care of things around the office and get paid a reasonable salary. You believe that, right?
oscar_martinez Totally, that's great.
pam_beesly I get paid $40,000 per year.
oscar_martinez Great.
pam_beesly Maybe $50,000.
oscar_martinez $50,000?
pam_beesly No, not $50,000, $41,000, I think. $41,500.
oscar_martinez That's great.
jim_halpert Before me stands your coworker, Dwight Kurt Schrute. Dwight, show them all sides. Turn around. Now, today, we need your help turning Dwight into a gentleman.
andy_bernard A gentleman who is a rich snob who will go into shopping malls and drop huge amounts of cash on clothes.
stanley_hudson Is he still doing his boycott?
jim_halpert No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
kelly_kapoor You shirt and tie are disgusto-barfo.
jim_halpert Agreed.
dwight_schrute Really?
oscar_martinez Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
dwight_schrute Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
ryan_howard The glasses are a little...
pam_beesly I liked them.
kelly_kapoor I thought they were kind of cute.
ryan_howard Yeah, I liked them too.
dwight_schrute I can't see.
darryl_philbin Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that.
dwight_schrute Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?"
darryl_philbin I'm telling you how to do this man.
andy_bernard If someone offers you a cocktail, accept, but keep your wits about you.
angela_martin Please and thank you go a long way.
dwight_schrute Copy. Thank you.
angela_martin Thank you.
dwight_schrute Please.
andy_bernard I think he's got it!
michael_scott And I was raised by wolves. I was 25 years old before I saw my first human being. Wait, is it a full moon tonight?
toby_flenderson Come on Michael. Those are all fake stories.
michael_scott Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that? Three hours. We're half way done.
toby_flenderson Oh.
pam_beesly Hey, do you have a second?
gabe_lewis Yeah.
pam_beesly Well, as I am sure you know, for the past few months, I've been the Office Administrator. Since right before you guys took over.
gabe_lewis Right, of course!
pam_beesly And, I haven't gotten paid yet. I'm not blaming you.
gabe_lewis Thank you so much.
pam_beesly I just think somebody lost the paperwork.
gabe_lewis Oh boy. Can you get every department head's signature on this so I can back this up to corporate?
pam_beesly Yes. Absolutely. Right away.
toby_flenderson You know what Michael? You're right. You win. This is pointless. We're not getting anywhere. I got a bunch of fun stuff, in case my daughter ever comes over. Why don't we just run out the clock by playing games, drawing some pictures, talking?
andy_bernard
jim_halpert We present to you for your comments and approval, Dwight K. Shrute.
phyllis_vance Go get 'em Dwight.
jim_halpert Wish us luck!
dwight_schrute Thank you.
erin_hannon Dwight
erin_hannon Disposable cameras are fun, although it does seem wasteful and you don't ever get to see your pictures. If it's an important even that you want to remember, I recommend using a real camera. But I don't care if I forget today.
toby_flenderson We can play something more complicated if you like.
michael_scott This is plenty complicated.
toby_flenderson So you have played it before?
michael_scott I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
toby_flenderson Who's Jeff?
michael_scott Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
toby_flenderson So, her husband, your stepdad?
michael_scott Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
toby_flenderson Did you guys do much stuff together?
michael_scott Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
toby_flenderson It's working. I'm doing it!
angela_martin
dwight_schrute What?
angela_martin My place tonight. Wear this.
dwight_schrute Do you have your card?
angela_martin Yes. Don't forget the pipe.
toby_flenderson Its really sad that your dog ran away. Why did it keep you from going to the park?
michael_scott I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
toby_flenderson Why?
michael_scott I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
toby_flenderson Dogs don't do that.
michael_scott Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
toby_flenderson I don't know.
michael_scott When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...
toby_flenderson It's very important for you to be liked, isn't it?
michael_scott Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
toby_flenderson I'm just trying to help you Michael.
michael_scott You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
toby_flenderson I just want to...
michael_scott You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
toby_flenderson Just fill them out any way you want.
michael_scott Ok.
toby_flenderson I'll have Erin fax them back to corporate.
michael_scott You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these and call me in the morning.
pam_beesly Hey Michael, um... about three months ago, I was talking to...
pam_beesly There are a lot of one person departments here, so, there's a lot of department heads. But I'm off to a good start. Oh, man! If I could pull this off, it will be scam of all scams. And yet very helpful to everyone.
gabe_lewis So, Corporate got your evaluations, and they want me to check, is that really how you feel about Michaels situation?
toby_flenderson Yes.
gabe_lewis That is not how it seems to me.
toby_flenderson He seems fine.
gabe_lewis You marked severe in all the categories, including at risk for homicidal behavior.
toby_flenderson Heh.
darryl_philbin I saw a TLC show on Kate Walsh's home office. All corkboard.
pam_beesly We can do that.
darryl_philbin Right in here?
pam_beesly Easily.
gabe_lewis I'm back! Ha ha. Pam, perfect. I was hoping to talk to the office administrator about a little office administration problem.
pam_beesly But of course!
gabe_lewis Great.
gabe_lewis The problem, unfortunately, is about the office administrator. I have gone through everything for the past three years. There is nothing that says you are the office administrator.
pam_beesly So weird that there is no paperwork.
gabe_lewis At all.
pam_beesly Although, like, unlikely things happen all the time. My best friend, in High School, she went to Australia, Canberra I think, and she met this guy who lived only two streets away in America.
gabe_lewis Pam, I don't want to accuse you of anything. I just want everything to be back the way it's supposed to be. Can you just admit... admit...
pam_beesly Admit what?
gabe_lewis I don't want to say it.
pam_beesly Say it.
gabe_lewis Mm-hmm.
pam_beesly Say that I'm lying or say that I have the job. Make a definitive statement, Gabe.
gabe_lewis Statements of such nature, while they have their place, are overused in a competitive business environment.
pam_beesly Great. Well, Let me know if you need a new chair, or anything that an Office Administrator can handle.
gabe_lewis Will do... Can I get one of those name plates... that says Gabe Lewis?
pam_beesly Sure. Anything else?
gabe_lewis Nope.
pam_beesly I'll get it right away.
pam_beesly The first lesson of watching World Poker Tour at 2 00 AM, you play the opponent. Not the cards.
jim_halpert Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
dwight_schrute It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
jim_halpert Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
dwight_schrute Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
jim_halpert That's it.
store_salesman Let me know if I can help you with anything.
dwight_schrute Excuse me sir.
store_salesman Yes?
dwight_schrute I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
store_salesman I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that.
dwight_schrute You work on commission, don't you?
jim_halpert Stop, stop, stop.
store_salesman No, we don't.
jim_halpert Did you just say you remember him?
store_salesman Of course, but he looks much less threatening now.
jim_halpert What does that mean?
store_salesman We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back...
dwight_schrute Good Morning!
store_salesman If he were in accordance with our dress policy.
dwight_schrute What?
store_salesman But the blood stained hands...
dwight_schrute It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
store_salesman I'm very sorry.
dwight_schrute Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
jim_halpert Lets just go.
dwight_schrute You made a big mistake. Huge!
jim_halpert There it is. Alright.
dwight_schrute Aaah!
jim_halpert That's pretty good.
andy_bernard After you.
dwight_schrute I'll take the wizard!
store_salesman Oh, ok!
michael_scott You forged them! You forged the forms!
toby_flenderson You filled them in and faxed them yourself!
michael_scott Yes.
toby_flenderson You remember that.
michael_scott Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
toby_flenderson Unless part of you made that mistake on purpose.
michael_scott You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!" Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
