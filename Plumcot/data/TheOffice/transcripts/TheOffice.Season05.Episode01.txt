michael_scott All right, everybody. This is your last meal, so eat up.
dwight_schrute From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
michael_scott This summer, corporate is sponsoring a little weight loss contest between the branches. Whichever branch loses the most weight gets three extra vacation days.
meredith_palmer What should we do with all these leftovers?
stanley_hudson I'm taking the dumplings for my wife.
dwight_schrute No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
creed_bratton I can bring these to my shelter.
stanley_hudson I'm taking my dumplings.
dwight_schrute There. Take those home to your wife.
michael_scott Dwight, Dwight!
dwight_schrute Michael, it's time.
dwight_schrute Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
darryl_philbin Don't go breaking my scale.
andy_bernard I'm excited to lose weight for the wedding, because I really want to have washboard abs the first time Angela sees me naked.
holly_flax Ex-squeeze me.
michael_scott No, I will ex-squeeze you.
michael_scott OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
dwight_schrute Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
jim_halpert Really, nothing?
darryl_philbin 2,336 pounds. Y'all need to learn some portion control.
dwight_schrute Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
michael_scott Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
dwight_schrute Family only.
darryl_philbin All right, got it. 2,210 pounds.
kevin_malone Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?
holly_flax Almost, Kevin.
pam_beesly Not almost, though, Holly. I mean, not -- not close to 200...
holly_flax Math is hard.
kevin_malone Yeah.
pam_beesly Just, we'll just keep going.
andy_bernard I'm totally gonna slaughter at the weigh-in today.
oscar_martinez All I had this weekend to eat was a chicken breast and a case of Diet Coke.
andy_bernard Really? 'Cause I haven't eaten anything since noon on Friday.
oscar_martinez OK. Stanley, come on.
stanley_hudson Oh, I forgot something in my car. I'll see you guys up there.
stanley_hudson I happen to be losing weight on my own for my own reasons. The truth is, I have lost a little of my speed, a little of my fire. Here's what I used to look like. Look at those biceps. We were fighting the power and eating whatever we wanted.
holly_flax And arch your back. And slowly bring up your head.
michael_scott Jimbo.
jim_halpert Ah, they moved the shower.
michael_scott Did you see Holly's butt?
jim_halpert No, I didn't. You know why?
michael_scott Why?
jim_halpert Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
michael_scott I know.
jim_halpert But what have you learned about her?
michael_scott I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times.
jim_halpert Nice.
michael_scott And that her butt refuses to quit!
jim_halpert Well, I tried.
michael_scott You have to agree with me. That's insane.
jim_halpert I'll just go later.
michael_scott I thought you had to pee.
dwight_schrute
oscar_martinez Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
holly_flax Oh, thanks. I should check that out.
oscar_martinez Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
holly_flax Actually, I'm a lesbian.
oscar_martinez I'm gay!
holly_flax I'm not a lesbian. I don't know why I said that... It's a joke.
oscar_martinez What's the joke?
holly_flax There is no joke. I just said it because I haven't had much luck lately and I'm not really looking to date. Maybe I should switch to women.
oscar_martinez Oh, you think it's a choice?
holly_flax Um, I'm gonna head back to my work area and just--
oscar_martinez I'm messing with you, Holly.
holly_flax I knew that. OK, bye.
oscar_martinez OK.
jim_halpert So you have the directions.
pam_beesly Yes.
jim_halpert You have a toothbrush.
pam_beesly Yes.
jim_halpert You have a cell phone charger.
pam_beesly I have everything.
pam_beesly Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. What up, 212?
dwight_schrute Fax this for me.
jim_halpert Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
dwight_schrute It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
andy_bernard Ang. Ela. Ella, ella, ella. Under my Angerela. Ella, ella, ella. Ay, ay--
angela_martin What?
andy_bernard Hey, check it out. This is The Breakers, Newport, Rhode Island. Huge, awesome gorgeous mansion overlooking the Atlantic. And my dad went to Cornell with the current groundskeeper.
andy_bernard Every little boy fantasizes about his fairy-tale wedding.
angela_martin No. No.
andy_bernard This is where my parents decided not to get divorced.
angela_martin I don't care.
andy_bernard OK. How do you feel about Maine? I'm on it. I'll see you later, love.
dwight_schrute Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
angela_martin Well, that was the last time, Dwight. I mean it.
dwight_schrute Monkey.
angela_martin No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
michael_scott Hey, hey! Pam, Pam! Hey!
jim_halpert What happened?
michael_scott I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
pam_beesly I should really get going.
michael_scott No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."
pam_beesly I'm sure it was really lovely.
michael_scott I took a lot from other poems.
jim_halpert Call me when you get in.
pam_beesly OK, bye.
jim_halpert Bye.
michael_scott All right, call--
pam_beesly No, Michael.
jim_halpert Why haven't I proposed yet? Uh, actually Pam and I talked about it. And we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. And Pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. Something in her past, I guess. I'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here...
michael_scott OK, no, no, no, no, no, no. Same places as last week.
angela_martin It doesn't matter, Michael.
michael_scott Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
holly_flax Oh, fancy meeting you here.
michael_scott All right.
darryl_philbin OK, everybody smile. Ho! You lost 31 pounds.
michael_scott All right!
jim_halpert I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
michael_scott I'm MC Mike Scott, and I am hot. She's DJ Jazzy Flax, and she is the best. All those sucker branches can suck our fat!
holly_flax Wikka wikka wikka what?
ronni Dunder Mifflin, this is Ronnie.
jim_halpert I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
professor Sorry I'm late. I accidentally switched my alarm clock setting to Zapf Chancery. Which is my terrible segue into our course, Expressive Typography in New Media.
pam_beesly I'm in the wrong class...
professor Some of you may remember from last semester I am Professor Monaghan. And looks like I'm boring someone already.
pam_beesly Oh, no. I just--
professor Please sit down.
holly_flax You're shaking. Are you all right?
kelly_kapoor Just leave me alone!
kelly_kapoor I am on the third day of my cleanse diet. All I have to do is drink maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne pepper and water for all three meals. Um, I just bought some bikinis online, size 2. So ... gonna look amazing.
ronni Hi, can I help you?
jan_levinson I need you to make me 100 copies of this on canary yellow.
kevin_malone Hi Jan.
jan_levinson Hi.
kevin_malone How's the candle game?
jan_levinson Oh, great. Yeah, Serenity by Jan is kicking ass and taking names. You remember last week when that girl went missing? Guess whose candles they used for the vigil?
kevin_malone Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
jan_levinson Oh, they found her?
michael_scott Hi, Jan. Hello, baby. How are you? Good to see you. Who's your daddy? You don't know who your daddy is, do you? No, you don't. Come on. Let's go in.
jim_halpert When Michael told us that Jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. By telling us that he was the father.
holly_flax Hey, Oscar. Who's that woman in Michael's office with the feet?
jan_levinson That's his ex.
holly_flax Oh, she's very beautiful.
oscar_martinez Yes, she is. And clinically insane.
holly_flax So, listen, I don't know if your offer still stands or whatever, but you can give your yoga teacher my number.
oscar_martinez OK.
angela_martin Listen, dummy! It's not that hard. All you have to do is take the numbers from the sales report and type them into a master spreadsheet. A G.D. monkey could do it. I do not understand why you can't do it.
holly_flax No! You do not talk to him like that!
angela_martin But he's an idiot!
kevin_malone Hey!
holly_flax He is not an idiot!
kevin_malone Thank you, Holly.
holly_flax He is mentally challenged. But he's doing a super job here.
kevin_malone Wait, back up. Do you think that I am retarded?
holly_flax Well, no. Dwight...
angela_martin Oh, Holly, that is very offensive.
holly_flax I'm sorry.
andy_bernard Hey. So, since my little lady has such particular, impossible to perceive taste, I have made nonrefundable deposits at four totally different wedding locales Hot-air balloons over Napa Valley, world-famous Walt Disney's Epcot Center, scuba-diving wedding in the Bahamas and the Wilkes-Barre Marriott Ballroom C.
angela_martin Dangerous. Tacky. Sharks. Haunted. No.
angela_martin Hurry, we have to make this fast.
dwight_schrute Let's do this thing.
angela_martin Hey!
angela_martin I have a nice comforter and several cozy pillows. I usually read a chapter of a book, and it's lights out by 8 30. That's how I sleep at night!
jim_halpert All right, I am connecting and ... you are not there. Did you install it right? How about this Go to applications--
pam_beesly I can see you!
jim_halpert All right!
pam_beesly This is so cool.
jim_halpert So what is going on, girl in the computer?
pam_beesly Lunch with a girl from my hall.
jim_halpert Uh-huh.
pam_beesly Ceramics class. Then dinner by myself. I'm gonna watch HGTV and maybe go to Bungalow 8 with John Mayer.
dwight_schrute OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
michael_scott No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello. Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
pam_beesly Can you put me down I'm getting a little nauseous?
michael_scott Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
pam_beesly The nerve.
michael_scott Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
pam_beesly They're on the supply shelf.
michael_scott Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
pam_beesly New York is so exciting. I love my classes. The city's awesome. Um, can you give me back to Jim now, please?
michael_scott OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.
darryl_philbin 2,184 pounds, for a grand total -- oh! You all gained five pounds back.
michael_scott Damn it. Come on.
oscar_martinez Oh!
kevin_malone Oh, my God!
dwight_schrute Come on, Bernard.
michael_scott Here we go. Everybody on.
dwight_schrute All right, we're set.
darryl_philbin Still good. You guys lost a pound. You lost one pound.
kelly_kapoor I was on an IV for two days at the hospital.
stanley_hudson I lost four pounds. I don't know what those other fools were doing, but I lost four pounds.
phyllis_vance Angela, you'll go to the supermarket and get the New York cheesecake. Make sure it's the generic one. It's Stanley's favorite.
phyllis_vance Yes, I've replaced Angela as head of the party planning committee. I guess I was just in the right place at the right time.
michael_scott How's it going?
phyllis_vance It's going well.
michael_scott Good.
holly_flax I have a crazy idea. What if we did, um, fruit instead of cake?
michael_scott Cake? Who suggested cake?
phyllis_vance We lost weight today. I think it's OK to reward ourselves once in a while.
michael_scott Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
michael_scott What is wrong with these people? They have no willpower. I went -- I once went 28 years without having s*x. And then again for seven years.
michael_scott Does anyone have any idea what the number one cause of death is in this country?
dwight_schrute Shotgun weddings.
jim_halpert That's not what that is.
creed_bratton Fright. Being scared to death.
michael_scott No.
holly_flax Obesity-caused illnesses.
dwight_schrute Obesity-caused illnesses.
michael_scott Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
jim_halpert I would like to lose 65 pounds.
michael_scott Yes, all right. Who else? Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
angela_martin No. My doctor wants me to gain weight.
michael_scott If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
jim_halpert Cryogenics. Beer me five.
michael_scott This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
jim_halpert All right, I'm taking off.
michael_scott Booty call.
jim_halpert Nope, just going to see Pam.
michael_scott Here.
jim_halpert Maybe put up some shelves.
michael_scott Wait a second. I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
jim_halpert OK, thank you for ... this.
michael_scott You want more?
jim_halpert No.
andy_bernard I don't know if there's any one place that has all these things.
angela_martin It's not my problem.
andy_bernard Thousand-year-old church in the continental United States. There has to be a rainbow. 24-hour veterinarian on call.
angela_martin That is very important to me, so -- I have work to do. Just do it.
andy_bernard Sweetheart. Just so you know, I don't care where we get married. I'll marry you right here in this building. I'll marry you in the parking lot. I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane in the middle of a snowstorm on top of a monsoon. All I care about is that we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
andy_bernard Hey-oh!
angela_martin I know I haven't made this easy on you.
jim_halpert Hi.
pam_beesly Hi. Mmm. 'Cause--
jim_halpert Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out.
michael_scott It's a pretty lame party.
ronni Does anyone want to dance?
jim_halpert Some girl came into Pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. So I'm in here waiting it out.
phyllis_vance Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
stanley_hudson I don't like cake anymore
andy_bernard Why not, dawg?
stanley_hudson Tastes changed. Now all I like is baklava.
dwight_schrute Michael, we have a situation.
dwight_schrute They should not be in that room.
holly_flax That's so lame they didn't invite us.
michael_scott You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
dwight_schrute Yeah!
michael_scott Let's go mini-golfing.
holly_flax Hey, could I have a rain check on the mini-golf. I, uh, actually have a date tonight.
michael_scott Uh...
holly_flax It'll probably be a total disaster, but...
michael_scott Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
dwight_schrute Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
michael_scott You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
holly_flax Really?
michael_scott Yeah.
holly_flax Oh, that's sweet. Wish me luck.
michael_scott Good luck.
michael_scott Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
dwight_schrute Party's over. You are so busted!
michael_scott OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
phyllis_vance You said fruit, Michael.
michael_scott And what is that?
phyllis_vance Cake.
michael_scott You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
dwight_schrute Happy Birthday, Stanley!
holly_flax It's kind of a good news, bad news situation. The bad news is we're not doing very well, so we really had to starve ourselves this whole week. But the good news is that all the other branches are doing just as bad as we are, so corporate upped the prize to five days. So if we stay fat long enough, we may actually get a whole month off.
kevin_malone What?
creed_bratton Oh nothing.
kelly_kapoor It's just some of us are taking this really seriously.
kelly_kapoor I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico.
creed_bratton That wasn't a tapeworm.
ryan_howard How's my favorite branch doing? All right .
michael_scott Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.
ryan_howard And you got a goatee!
michael_scott I did!
ryan_howard Did you get that after you helped me move and you saw mine?
michael_scott Yes. Gooooo-tee!
kevin_malone Firrrrre-duh guy!
ryan_howard Hey Kevin... That's really funny.
kevin_malone Yeah.
ryan_howard It's great to see you Kev.
kevin_malone You too.
ryan_howard I'm keeping a list... of everyone who wrongs me. So when I'm back on top, they'll be sorry. Kevin just made the list.
ryan_howard Jim. I wanted to apologize... for how I treated you last year. I lost sight of myself and now that I've quit the rat race I've realized there's so much more to life than being the youngest VP in the company's history. I've even started volunteering. Giving back to the community.
jim_halpert Well that's great. You're talking about your court ordered community service?
ryan_howard I don't need a judge to tell me to keep my community clean.
jim_halpert But he did, right?
ryan_howard All right.
jim_halpert All right.
ryan_howard
darryl_philbin Well you lost zero pounds. No change. On the bright side you gained zero pounds.
michael_scott Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
andy_bernard Damnit, I need these five days for my honeymoon! Who is slacking?
holly_flax Ok, let's just all try and work harder, ok?
andy_bernard NO! I want names!
andy_bernard This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life. I haven't had a very hard life.
oscar_martinez So how was your date?
holly_flax Eight point five. I got a red wine stain on my favorite shirt. But he's cute, right?
michael_scott
holly_flax What's wrong?
michael_scott Mmm--- mmm... Um...
michael_scott Close the door. This is your fault.
jim_halpert Nope.
michael_scott Your stupid friend zone.
jim_halpert Mmm.
michael_scott I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!
dwight_schrute Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
jim_halpert How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
dwight_schrute I am hardly the problem, Jim.
jim_halpert No, you're definitely the problem.
dwight_schrute This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
ryan_howard Kelly.
kelly_kapoor Oh, hello Ryan. You look well.
ryan_howard I wanted to say I'm sorry... for treating you bad the past couple years. I was in my mid twenties and I was goin' through a lot of stuff. I think I never fully processed 9/11. Um, I want you to know I've changed.
kelly_kapoor Cool.
ryan_howard We should get a drink later. Catch up. Pick me up around eight?
kelly_kapoor Oh that is so sweet. Um, but I'm dating Darryl, still, and we're like crazy in love so...
ryan_howard That--- I, um... cool. Well maybe I'll see you around.
kelly_kapoor It's a small office.
ryan_howard Yeah.
dwight_schrute Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry... about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line.
phyllis_vance Yes you were.
dwight_schrute But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested?
phyllis_vance Split the commission?
dwight_schrute Sixty - forty. Hm? I'll drive.
ryan_howard
holly_flax Dieting's only half of it.
michael_scott Mmm-hmm. Saunas.
holly_flax And exercise. Although I know everybody loves going to the gym.
michael_scott Gah, the dreadmill.
jim_halpert Probably the weirdest thing about Pam being gone would be lunch... actually. But um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people I consider... coworkers.
Friend#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode01 Oh, my God. Ok. Everybody just act normal. Don't say anything.
pam_beesly What?
Friend#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode01 My ex-girlfriend. She's right behind you. Just... hide me.
pam_beesly Really, where?
Friend#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode01 No no! Don't look!
pam_beesly Wow, was it the age difference?
Friend#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode01 Uh, actually, kind of. Yes. I just didn't like eating dinner that early.
pam_beesly Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!
phyllis_vance Are you insane?!
dwight_schrute Hey, hey!
oscar_martinez Oh my God, what happened?
phyllis_vance There was no client. Dwight drove me to an abandoned warehouse five miles away and pushed me out of the car. I had to walk home with no money and no phone.
dwight_schrute And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!
phyllis_vance You left me in a bad part of town!
dwight_schrute Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about? You look great. I can definitely see the difference.
phyllis_vance Phyllis Vance for David Wallace.
holly_flax "...or that Dunder Mifflin does not discriminate. Nor does it condone unhealthy dieting habits or extreme weight loss strategies. As was clearly stated in the official starting---"
michael_scott Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
holly_flax What are you doing?
jim_halpert Fair question.
michael_scott I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful. They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful.
michael_scott It's my sumo suit. I just didn't inflate it all the way. I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.
michael_scott Body image. We are here because there is something wrong with society.
jim_halpert See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
michael_scott If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"
kevin_malone Because you're kind of doing Michael Clump.
michael_scott How do you know Michael Clump?
oscar_martinez Because it's your making-fun-of-fat-people character.
michael_scott How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
oscar_martinez I think of him as more like... a monster? What about, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"
dwight_schrute No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"
michael_scott No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
dwight_schrute Vamping.
michael_scott Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please?
dwight_schrute Eh, I've been sitting all day.
michael_scott We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else. Hey. Hey. You shaved?
ryan_howard I did.
michael_scott Why?
ryan_howard
professor So, in the year 2000, fungus and even black mold was discovered growing in the cave. Some blame it on the new air conditioning system they installed. Some, on the high powered lights. Others feel that fungus is do to an over---
pam_beesly Nice.
professor Quiet please.
pam_beesly Sorry.
Friend#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode01 Sorry.
michael_scott Dwight, I would like you to apologize to this beautiful, beautiful woman for forcing her to walk five miles, which for her is basically a death march.
dwight_schrute She should thank me.
michael_scott Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
phyllis_vance Why should I have to thank him?
michael_scott You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok.
dwight_schrute I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
michael_scott Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat? Let's all clap at Phyllis. Ok! When Michael Clump wants to remind you that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly. Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go. Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful?
ryan_howard Everything. She's perfect.
meredith_palmer I like her nails.
michael_scott Ok, be more specific.
meredith_palmer I like her fingernails.
phyllis_vance I like her purple dress.
michael_scott What about her looks?
creed_bratton Hell of an ass.
kelly_kapoor ...what else do people like?
phyllis_vance I wonder what people like about me? ... Probably my jugs.
michael_scott Kelly, will you just agree to stop this mess and stop trying to kill yourself?
kelly_kapoor I hate dieting, I hate it so much. I hate this worm inside of me!
michael_scott I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug. Mmmmmm.
jim_halpert Summers going great. Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump. I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer. My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days. How's your summer?
michael_scott Hey Ryan, look. Shaved off my goatee. I am goateeless. We are the goateeless brothers.
ryan_howard Oh...
michael_scott Ahaha, Yep!
oscar_martinez How was Friday night?
holly_flax Oh, I had a good time, but it's been three days and no call. I even have two tickets to see Counting Crows for tonight, so...
oscar_martinez He'll call.
michael_scott Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
darryl_philbin You guys lost four pounds.
michael_scott Hey!
darryl_philbin I say we have a parade.
dwight_schrute We better.
michael_scott Excellent! Good job.
jim_halpert So as it turns out, tonight is my nephews T-ball game and I kinda missed the first three, so...
pam_beesly You've already disappointed him so much. He can't be expecting a lot from you.
jim_halpert I know. I suck.
dwight_schrute Yes, you do.
jim_halpert Dwight says "Hi."
dwight_schrute I do not! I do not say "Hi" Pam!
jim_halpert Now he is saying "Hi" louder.
pam_beesly I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
jim_halpert Umm...
pam_beesly No football games, recitals, karate tournaments.
jim_halpert Hey, can you go to IM?
pam_beesly OK.
jim_halpert OK.
jim_halpert Let's meet for lunch.
dwight_schrute What are you writing about me?
pam_beesly What -- today?
jim_halpert Yeah. C'mon we'll meet halfway. You'll be back for your 4 o'clock class.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
jim_halpert I'm gonna write you up for not working.
dwight_schrute Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
pam_beesly Where?
jim_halpert The rest stop where that soda exploded on me. Exit 17, I think. 1 o'clock.
pam_beesly Alright. See you there. ) P.S. I finally finished my summer project.
jim_halpert
michael_scott Yeah, oh, hey. Did he call?
holly_flax I just got off... Kendall? I just got off...
michael_scott No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?
holly_flax Oh, no.
david_wallace Really?
holly_flax No.
david_wallace Aach.
holly_flax And you know what? I even got two tickets to see the Counting Crows tonight as a surprise. Why do guys not call when they say they are gonna call?
michael_scott I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco.
holly_flax Thanks. That's sweet. Anyways, umm, seems like we lost to Utica by only eight pounds.
michael_scott Ugh.
holly_flax Well, at least everyone lost weight. That's all that really matters.
michael_scott Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
holly_flax So we're only eight pounds behind Utica. Now, I know it's a stretch but we could weigh ourselves again at the end of the day and maybe win this thing after all.
andy_bernard Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
andy_bernard Andy Bernard does not lose contests. He wins them... or he quits them because they are unfair.
michael_scott Hey, is that healthy food?
kelly_kapoor Nope.
michael_scott We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please?
jim_halpert Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
michael_scott Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
jim_halpert Perfect.
dwight_schrute
angela_martin I hate to even ask because you have been so accommodating about all the wedding stuff.
andy_bernard Your wish is my command.
angela_martin Is there any way our first dance can be to my favorite song, The Little Drummer Boy?
andy_bernard Of course!
angela_martin Really?
andy_bernard Yeah! I mean it's a great song. I always thought it was bigger than Christmas anyway. You know?
angela_martin Mmhmm.
andy_bernard And you know what? The guys already know it so it's easy breezy.
angela_martin The guys?
andy_bernard I didn't tell you.
angela_martin Mm-mm
andy_bernard Here Comes Treble, class of '96 was available for our big day, so, I booked 'em.
angela_martin I don't think that...
andy_bernard And, they are collectively my best man. And they are crashing with us for three weeks, so... it totally works out.
angela_martin I don't know if I want your old college a capella group to be our wedding band.
andy_bernard Ok, I hear you, sweetheart, but this is a deal breaker. But you know what? You're gonna love these guys. Carl 1, Carl 2, Broccoli Rob, Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunch Box, Boner Champ, that's me, Pubie Lewis and the News, Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich. These are the best best-man a guy could ever hope for.
angela_martin Let's talk about this later.
andy_bernard Mm-wah!
pam_beesly Hey! This is not half-way! I did the math. I had to drive way longer than you. Montclair would have been closer, so you have to buy lunch.
jim_halpert
pam_beesly What are you doing?
jim_halpert I just... couldn't wait.
pam_beesly Oh my God!
jim_halpert Pam, will you marry me?
pam_beesly Oh my God!
jim_halpert So?
pam_beesly Yes!
dwight_schrute God. Where is Jim?
holly_flax I'm calling it. I guess that's curtains for the yoga guy.
michael_scott Aww, really?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
holly_flax Yeah?
michael_scott ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
holly_flax Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
michael_scott I know. I love Counting Crows.
holly_flax Look at where my seats were.
michael_scott Wow, really?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you.
holly_flax Michael, you don't have to buy them.
michael_scott I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do.
holly_flax Ok.
michael_scott Ok?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott Alright. Alright! Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott Is that good?
holly_flax Yeah.
jim_halpert Hey, sorry everybody.
dwight_schrute What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late.
andy_bernard Wet Tuna!
jim_halpert Hey Dwight.
michael_scott OK.
jim_halpert What's up, Meredith?
meredith_palmer Nothing.
dwight_schrute Dripping on me.
michael_scott Darryl, would you do the honors?
darryl_philbin Two thousand one hundred seventy-five. Sorry guys.
michael_scott Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers.
stanley_hudson I don't know about anyone else. But it was a good summer for me. I lost seven pounds. And you know what? I'm just gonna take five days off anyway.
toby_flenderson Oh, I went zip lining my third day in Costa Rica. I guess the harness wasn't strapped in exactly right. I broke my neck. And, I've been in the hospital five weeks now. I still haven't seen the beach. It's nice to have visitors.
