New#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode11 Instant Message Stone & Son Suit Warehouse contract expired with their paper provider! Go get it! –David Wallace
dwight_schrute Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business . Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family – brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
dwight_schrute I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of "Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire".
jim_halpert Sorry, Stinky, can't do it. Too busy.
dwight_schrute Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky.
jim_halpert Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
dwight_schrute Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
phyllis_vance I have ears, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim?
jim_halpert Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now.
dwight_schrute How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
jim_halpert Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
dwight_schrute Mmm. That's a good... question. 300 times... 180... Um that comes to 25 minutes. Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
nellie_bertram Darryl, looking good!
darryl_philbin Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim's company.
pam_beesly Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?
darryl_philbin Why don't you come along and tell him yourself?
pam_beesly Ha ha. That'd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get... What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?
erin_hannon Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
pam_beesly A delivery guy will deliver a box of pens, and you just make sure everything's in order.
erin_hannon What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it's in order? I haven't been trained for this.
pam_beesly Okay, see you later.
clark Hey guys.
phyllis_vance Clark!
meredith_palmer Hey!
oscar_martinez Hey, look who's back, Dwight Junior.
kevin_malone Hey, so how was it? I mean... the s*x with Jan.
clark A gentleman doesn't discuss such matters. Especially when the feelings of a lady are involved.
clark Women reach their sexual peak at whatever age Jan was last week. I mean it was... like making love with a wild animal. But not like a cougar like you might think. It was uh... like a swarm of bees. Bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.
meredith_palmer Nothing wrong with being a gentleman. Like my mom used to say, "Talk classy, act nasty".
clark What's with the wig Meredith?
meredith_palmer What, is it on backwards?
clark Nope, you got it. You fixed it. Uh, I have a gift from Jan. It's an espresso maker! We came to be quite fond of espresso on the Amalfi Coast so... bon appetite.
phyllis_vance Ooo! 16 types of espresso! Now that's Italian.
oscar_martinez My friend has one of these. Fool-proof espresso every time.
meredith_palmer Always with the friends Oscar. Can't we just enjoy the new espresso machine?
oscar_martinez Actually, it's pronounced "espresso"... Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So...
dwight_schrute There he is! We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but...
clark If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
dwight_schrute Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh... No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
clark I loved it.
dwight_schrute How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
clark If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend.
dwight_schrute Then looks like we have a deal... Son
erin_hannon Hi guys!
pete_miller Hey, look who it is!
erin_hannon Sorry. Super-busy. Pens coming in later, just grabbing a Java before all hell breaks loose.
oscar_martinez Try this one.
erin_hannon Thank you!
erin_hannon I don't really have time to think about Pete right now. I just have a lot going on with this whole shipment of pens. And I have a lot of people trusting me, and I would feel super guilty if I broke anyone's trust. About the pens.
pam_beesly You ready for your interview?
darryl_philbin I was born ready! No, I suck at interviews. I had Andy's job in the bag until my interview.
pam_beesly Well, you shouldn't be nervous about this. This is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as Jim.
darryl_philbin Yeah, I guess...
pam_beesly Really, you can't be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he's basically Gumby with hair.
sam_stone_sr Store Father It's kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.
dwight_schrute You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy?
clark No, we sure hadn't Pop.
dwight_schrute Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?
clark He calls me Clarky ‘cause he's my Dad.
dwight_schrute Guilty!
sam_stone_sr Store Father You don't meet many hunters these days.
clark My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial killer... of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick!
dwight_schrute It was his birthday, just turned three. So...
sam_stone_sr Store Father Ahh...
oscar_martinez You guys, I kind of think I want to try them all. Is that crazy?
nellie_bertram No. Look, without a taste test, how are we supposed to know which flavors we like to reorder?
kevin_malone Taste test? I'm in!
oscar_martinez YOLO!
phyllis_vance What?
oscar_martinez It's a thing. It means "you only live once".
kevin_malone Yeah, we're aware of what it means Oscar, you just do not look cool saying it.
oscar_martinez Well...
kevin_malone Alright everybody, who's in? Angela? Don't make us come over there.
angela_martin No, I don't... no.
kevin_malone Alright, let's go.
angela_martin Can't I just agree without putting my hand in?
nellie_bertram Absolutely not!
kevin_malone No way.
angela_martin Oh, fine.
kevin_malone Ok guys, "we all drink them all".
all@ We all drink them all!
kevin_malone Yes!
oscar_martinez Yes!
nellie_bertram Whoo!
phyllis_vance Hey, where's my ring?
creed_bratton I'm sure it'll turn up.
athlead_employee Employee Yes ma'am, you want to go east on Franklin, take that all the way to Commonweath. You'll see us on the right side, you can't miss us.
dennis ...And I want to reach every demographic possible.
jim_halpert No, I hear what you're saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
dennis We're talking weeks here, not months, right?
jim_halpert Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
dennis Alright. Good.
jim_halpert Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it. Hey! How are you?
pam_beesly Good!
jim_halpert What are you doing here?
pam_beesly I just wanted to see you!
jim_halpert That's so great!
darryl_philbin Damn! Jim, you got a real Facebook energy going on here man. You Zuckerberged this place out!
jim_halpert It's pretty great, right? I mean, we're coming along... Hey, Wade, we gotta just push up Dennis's timeline
Wade#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode11 Okay
jim_halpert Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
dwight_schrute ...But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark's getting out of my car. He's a good boy, does whatever I say.
sam_stone_sr Store Father I can't relate to that, my son hates my guts.
dwight_schrute Oh... really.
sam_stone_sr Store Father Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?
dwight_schrute Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son.
clark Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but... God I missed you!
dwight_schrute What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
clark I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
dwight_schrute You're being disrespectful!
clark ...And I love you, for saying that.
dwight_schrute We don't get along.
clark Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is... our relationship is... terr-
dwight_schrute Terrible!
clark Terrible.
dwight_schrute Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
pam_beesly Wow, this place is... so great. I had no idea – on the phone, you made it sound kind of dinky.
jim_halpert Well, I mean, I don't even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so... These things go down all the time.
darryl_philbin If this company's going down, I wanna go down on it. With it. I wanna go down with it.
jim_halpert Are you cool to just hang out?
pam_beesly Sure, no problem.
jim_halpert Yeah? You ready?
darryl_philbin Yeah.
jim_halpert Let's do it!
erin_hannon The pen delivery went amazing, and now I've got all these pens just waiting to be unpacked. But Pam did not tell me to unpack the pens, and I'm not one of those people who's just like, "Uh, sure. I'll accept the pens when they come in, and then as soon as your back's turned, I unpack the pens and get all this credit as some great pen unpacker. On the other hand... they are just sitting here. Pam didn't tell me not to unpack them. Don't want to be a busybody, but I don't want to be a lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Busybody, lazybones. Ahh! My brain is ping-ponging around in my head right now, it's insane! I'm sorry, what was your question again? Oh yeah, no. I've never had an espresso before. They're good though.
nellie_bertram A-bam! My favorite is Viennese Amaretto. And the worst flavor I've tried so far is Alpine Select!
kevin_malone Yes!
angela_martin Ugh!
kevin_malone One!
angela_martin Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!
kevin_malone Two...
angela_martin Stop it!
kevin_malone Three...
oscar_martinez That's enough Kevin.
angela_martin Stop it Kevin!
kevin_malone Four!
oscar_martinez That's enough!
angela_martin Kevin!
clark So for your menswear catalogue, I think we can offer you some very competitive pricing.
sam_stone_sr Store Father I heard that before...
clark Well, I understand, but –
dwight_schrute I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
clark Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
sam_stone_sr Store Father Listen to him. He created you.
dwight_schrute Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you.
clark Women don't despise me...
dwight_schrute His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn't see it, or didn't wanna see it.
clark Alright, that's enough, ‘cause I can say some things about him too.
dwight_schrute Yeah? Like what?
clark Like the time that you got drunk and, and then... Killed those kids on their way to prom!
dwight_schrute That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught "saving treats" from the kitty litter box.
sam_stone_sr Store Father Really shameful...
clark So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
dwight_schrute Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
clark There's obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
dwight_schrute Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going "please kitty, may I have some more?" You can't make this stuff up!
clark No, I think someone could make it up. Someone with very few friends.
sam_stone_sr Store Son Hey fellas, sorry to keep you waiting.
sam_stone_sr Store Father Here he is, my son.
dwight_schrute Got cat turd collector written all over him.
sam_stone_sr Store Son ...Did you say cat turd collector?
athlead_employee Employee ...So definitely looking to expand our market, but for now we're just concentrating on athletes that are popular here in the northeast. Of course, that's not a mandate.
darryl_philbin "Mandate"- Always think of two men on a date. I have gay friends... I have one gay friend. Oscar?
jim_halpert Mm-hm
athlead_employee Employee Alright, so what makes you think you'd be a good fit here?
darryl_philbin Ummm... Alright. Obviously y'all look really busy, and uh, I don't want to waste your time anymore. Sorry, I just uhh... Obviously I'm not qualified to be here man, I'm... I'm a warehouse manager, you know...
athlead_employee Employee Darryl, I was a newspaper editor.
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode11 Athlead Employee Science teacher, volleyball coach.
3rd#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode11 Athlead Employee I work at a home shopping network.
4th#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode11 Athlead Employee I'm a laywer. I'm the only one here who can honestly help.
jim_halpert And as you know, I was a paper salesman. Hey, I find it helps if you just picture everybody naked.
darryl_philbin Cool. Hey, thanks...
athlead_employee Employee So how about we start over, hmm? Darryl, do you have any thoughts on the company?
darryl_philbin Yes, as a matter of fact, I uh... I wrote some down. There you go. Wow, this guy came prepared, it impresses me!
stanley_hudson Ah! So, this is what 2 00 P.M. looks like around here!
stanley_hudson I usually take a siesta about now.
pete_miller Stocking pens, huh? You're like the new office administrator.
erin_hannon No, I just took over the pen shipment because Pam had to leave. When I say it out loud, I know that sounds insane, but it's the truth, I swear.
kevin_malone Pam! Pam, look out! Erin's gunning for your job!
erin_hannon No, I'm not! It's not like that at all! Forget it, I'm so sorry.
kevin_malone Pam, look out!
erin_hannon Pens, you did not buy into this. I am sorry, what a day you've had.
athlead_employee Employee By the way, Jim talks about you all the time.
pam_beesly That's sweet that he talks about me.
athlead_employee Employee It's too bad he still hast to work part time in Scranton though...
pam_beesly Well, that's funny because I think of him as working part time in Philadelphia.
athlead_employee Employee We can't wait until you move here.
sam_stone_sr Store Son I'm sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?
dwight_schrute Do you mind? The men are talking.
sam_stone_sr Store Father Sons used to idolize their fathers.
dwight_schrute Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
sam_stone_sr Store Father I'd love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I'm just here for human contract.
sam_stone_sr Store Son Okay Pop...
dwight_schrute Wait, so you're the boss?
sam_stone_sr Store Son That's right.
clark Hi, I'm Clark.
sam_stone_sr Store Son Hey.
clark Let's talk.
sam_stone_sr Store Son Okay.
clark So if you look at our catalog here...
athlead_employee Employee Well, thanks for coming down Darryl.
Female#unknown#TheOffice.Season09.Episode11 Athlead Employee It was nice meeting you Darryl, I think you'd fit in great here.
darryl_philbin Yeah, yeah me too. I think it'd be like... You know what? I think it'd be like a Kevin Durant jump shot... Perfecto! Oh my god...
pam_beesly They're the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop. It's like if I put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and Cece knocks it over, I don't blame Cece.
darryl_philbin So I'm like a three year old girl in this scenario...
pam_beesly Say they don't hire you. It's not like you're out on the street. You have a great job with people who love you.
darryl_philbin And I'd only get to see Jada on the weekends. You know, I'm... I'm not so sure I'd like living in Philadelphia.
pam_beesly Right? Thank you! It's just Philly. Everyone's acting like it's New York or Paris or London.
darryl_philbin Who needs it?
pam_beesly Not us.
jim_halpert Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. They're going to make you pay for the fish, and... they wanted to know when you can start.
darryl_philbin What? How about yesterday?
pam_beesly Congratulations.
darryl_philbin Oh, thank you.
pam_beesly I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.
darryl_philbin Yes, I love Philly! Two-One-Five or die!
pam_beesly No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl... Maybe I'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him.
kevin_malone It feels really hot in here. Is it hot in here? It feels really really hot in here.
oscar_martinez It's insane! They need to have the A.C. on year round! January too!
angela_martin I don't get the point of this stupid window!
clark I mean, look, you and I both know that in paper or fashion, styles change. Check out my dad's suit. You are looking at pure acrylic. That's why his face always breaks out.
sam_stone_sr Store Son Does that suit come with a fire extinguisher?
clark You know what Dad? Maybe you should buy me a suit. I mean, I'm going to need one right? If I'm ever going to get a "real job" and move my "lazy ass" out of your "G.D. house".
sam_stone_sr Store Son He's got you there...
sam_stone_sr Store Son That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful... Although expensive.
dwight_schrute Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island.
clark Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
dwight_schrute That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
clark How do I look?
dwight_schrute Actually... You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too.
oscar_martinez Everyone! Now that we have all this energy, why don't we move the copier into the annex like we've always wanted to?
nellie_bertram Whoo!
meredith_palmer Frickin' A!
oscar_martinez Huh?
kevin_malone So long, noise!
oscar_martinez One, two, three!
nellie_bertram And we have torn up the carpet! Oh, we're going to be in so much trouble!
oscar_martinez Wait! It's beautiful. Hardwood! I always knew it was down here, I just never dreamed that I would actually see it.
meredith_palmer Tear up the carpet!
nellie_bertram Whoo!
darryl_philbin Kill their fish, and they still hire me. That's how you do that, baby. It's all good, I'm ready. Y'all ready for this?
pam_beesly Everybody dance now...
oscar_martinez Kevin, move. I can't pull up the rug if you're standing on it with your rhinoceros feet.
kevin_malone Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
angela_martin Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
nellie_bertram Oh, enough with the whining already! Why don't you just have some more coffee?
stanley_hudson It's all gone. I didn't get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
creed_bratton I saw the leaves twitch!
angela_martin Shut up!
creed_bratton You shut up!
oscar_martinez Everybody shut up and work!
phyllis_vance We don't work for you!
kevin_malone Yeah!
angela_martin Yeah!
stanley_hudson Hey, it's five o'clock.
oscar_martinez Kevin, can-
angela_martin What's going on?
dwight_schrute Yes! We did it!
clark You opened the door-
dwight_schrute And you closed it. The boys are back in town. High fives! Ha ha!
clark Hey, so all that really specific cat turd business, that was about you, right?
dwight_schrute You got me! I used to collect them!
clark Why?
dwight_schrute Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
pam_beesly Hey... What happened here?
erin_hannon You left me in charge of the pens, Pam. That's what happened. The pens happened.
pam_beesly ...Are the pens here?
