michael Hey, sport.
dwight I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?
michael Ow! God!
dwight Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
darryl I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
andy Big
idea double wedding. Me, Angela, you, Holly.
michael No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with jim and Pam.
jim Yeah, we'd never do that.
michael Yeah, so there you go.
kelly Michael, I got my bridesmaid dress.
michael Oh, wow, so quickly.
kelly Yeah, and you said I could get it in any color I wanted, so I picked white.
kevin Michael, did you tell your mom yet?
michael Nope. Nope. Not yet.
jim You wouldn't tell your mom?
kevin You love your mom.
kelly Call your mom, Michael.
michael I'll call her later.
group Call her! Call her!
michael I don't want to do that. All right. She is going to freak out!
andy Speakerphone!
michael That's -- thanks.
mother Hello?
michael Mom, I'm getting married.
mother No, you're not.
michael Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
mother Well, are you getting married?
michael No.
mother Are you--
michael I'm not, I'm not getting married. So. Psych.
kelly So I returned my bridesmaid dress, and it was on sale, so I'm out $100.
michael And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
kelly Yeah, uh, this is all of
them Jim, Dwight, Phyllis, Stanley, andy and -- oh. Oh, it's the receipt to my bridesmaid dress. What's that doing there?
michael I'll take care of that for you. Thanks.
michael kelly Kapoor is our dusky, exotic customer service rep. And once a year, she will contact our clients and find out how happy they are with our salespeople. Sort of a Kapoor's List. "Schindler's List" parody. . That's not appropriate, no.
jim Those reports affect our bonuses, which is kind of great for me, because you wouldn't know it from looking at her, but Pam's a gold-digger.
pam Hey, New York ain't free. Get back to work.
jim Aww.
pam It's the world's tiniest Bluetooth. I found it in a Japanese gadget store in the village. I got one for Jim, too. Jim, say something.
jim Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
pam We wanted to stay on the phone all day, but the company has a policy against eight-hour personal calls. So we're not telling anyone.
alex Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee? jim and
pam Sprinkle of cinnamon.
pam I should go.
michael Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
dwight Bring it on.
michael No.
dwight Sorry.
michael Wow.
dwight What does it say?
michael Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
dwight That's impossible.
michael A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
dwight I sell more paper than anyone.
michael No, no, no, no, no.
dwight Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
michael Do I look like I am joking?
dwight No, but that's sometimes part of it.
michael If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
dwight Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
michael You're not.
andy Yo, Tommy Tuna, did you get your scores yet?
jim Nope.
andy I got mine. They were really good.
pam I miss him.
jim You must be really proud.
andy Yeah, pretty psyched. Whoa! That's my mug.
jim Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
andy Right, well, it's mine, so if you could pour it out and get another one.
jim OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use uh, oh -- Snoopy.
pam Don't give him Snoopy. That's mine.
andy It is a great mug. But it's not my mug. That is my mug. So give it back.
jim How can you even be sure?
andy It has my face on it.
jim Make the face. Yeah, I don't see it.
andy Dude, that is my face!
pam What was that?
jim Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
pam Describe him exactly. What color mustard is his shirt? Yellow or Dijon?
jim It is. more of a spicy brown, actually.
dwight What are you mumbling about?
jim How was your meeting with Michael?
dwight None of your business.
jim Was it your scores?
dwight Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
jim Mm-hmm.
dwight I'm being sabotaged.
jim Of course.
dwight And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
jim Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
dwight You're an idiot.
jim There's the charm.
michael Jimbo, let's do this thang.
jim That is me. Wish me luck.
dwight No way.
pam Good luck.
jim Thanks.
dwight I didn't say anything
pam I love you.
jim I love you, too.
dwight What do you think I am saying to you?!
jim I'm not talking to you.
dwight I've caught jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
andy Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. It's really gorgeous. You guys do great work.
andy I found the best tentist on the east coast. He personally tented Giuliani's first and third weddings. And I got him. I got him!
andy Would you be able to do the same design, but with walls of gray? And a top that's gray too? Fabulous.
michael Oh, come on.
jim What?
michael You too?
jim Did my scores drop a little?
michael Jim, they are a poopy.
pam Jim? Jim?
jim Are we even sure that's my file?
michael No. Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
jim Well, there's got to be an explanation.
michael I agree.
jim Yeah.
michael So let's see what we can find out from reading. jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
jim I think you mean smug
michael Arrogance.
jim Michael, I'm just trying to --
michael And there's our smudgeness.
jim I need a decent bonus, because I'm actually in the process of buying my parents' house so that they can retire. And if history tells us anything, it's that you can't go wrong buying a house you can't afford. pam doesn't know about the house, so it's. a fun surprise. Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.
pam Maybe it's because you spent the whole year flirting with the receptionist.
jim A little bit. . Worth it.
michael Here's what's going to happen. I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale, a more micro form of management. Jim, what is that called?
jim Microgement.
michael Boom! Yes. Now, jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
dwight All right, fine. Brrring.
jim Hello?
dwight Hello, this is dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
jim Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
dwight Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
jim Wow, this is my lucky day.
michael Ask him his name.
dwight What is your name, sir?
jim I am Bill Buttlicker.
dwight Really, that's your real name?
jim How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
michael Be respectful, Dwight.
dwight Yes, Michael.
jim Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
dwight What? No, but I --
jim Hello? No, I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman. He's so dumb. Probably just gonna keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. Yeah, OK.
michael It's up to you to change his mind.
jim Sorry. That was a family emergency.
dwight Oh, no. What's wrong?
jim You know what? That's private.
michael Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
dwight Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
jim Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
michael He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
dwight OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
jim You're gonna have to talk louder.
dwight OK, our prices have never been lower.
jim Son, you have to talk louder.
dwight . never been lower!
jim Louder, son!
dwight Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
michael Stop it! Stop it!
dwight He --
michael That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
jim Now, you listen to me, sir.
michael Here we go.
jim The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
michael Give me the phone.
dwight Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
jim I'm irate right now.
michael Give me the phone.
dwight Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
michael Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
dwight I have to put you on with my boss.
jim Well, I should hope so. Who is this?
michael Hello, this is michael Scott, regional manager.
jim Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
michael Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
jim Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
dwight Yeah!
michael See how it's done? Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. See what I did?
dwight You are the master.
jim There is one condition, Michael.
michael Yes.
jim You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
dwight Don't do it, Michael.
michael . It's a million-dollar sale. . push;
andy So it's called the Shangri-La Tent. It's two stories, heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet. It's just really simple, really tasteful.
angela I don't want to be married in a tent like a hobo
andy Hobos live in trains.
angela Nana Mimi can't be in canvas that long.
andy Well, Nana Mim -- Ahh. OK, look. This tent is awesome. And it's in high demand, so I really think we should put a deposit down now.
angela OK fine you can have your tent, but only if it's in a field, a hand-plowed field
andy Done and done-er.
angela There has to be a barn that's old enough that you can see the stars through the roof slats when you lay on your back. And antique tools to look at when you roll over.
andy Do you have a specific place in mind?
angela No. But anything within a five- to eight-mile radius is acceptable.
andy On it!
jim Dwight. Dwight.
dwight Get in!
jim Are you serious?
dwight Get in!
jim OK, what are you --
dwight Shh. They might be listening to us.
jim What's that?
dwight They might be listening to us
jim Who's they?
dwight customer service might be monitoring this conversation.
jim In this car?
dwight You never know. Better safe than sorry.
jim What are you thinking?
dwight Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
jim The mob, maybe NASA.
dwight Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
jim Is there some evidence?
pam Ooh, cute shoes online.
jim How many shoes do you need?
dwight I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
jim I'm not talking to you.
dwight Who are you talking to?
jim Pam.
dwight She's not here, Jim.
jim No, she's not.
pam Na na na na na. Na na na na na na na.
andy Yes!
andy I found it. I found the perfect place. A local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm. And even better, I have an in with the owner. Oh, yeah. We work together. It's dwight Schrute. As in Schrute Farms.
customer So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um --
dwight Wait, shut up.
customer I'm sorry?
dwight Shh. Do you hear that?
customer Hear what?
dwight Breathing. Is that you?
customer Well, I am breathing, yes.
dwight Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on.
customer I need paper.
dwight Ha!
kelly Oh, my God. You scared me.
dwight Hear anything interesting?
kelly What are you talking about?
dwight I think you know.
kelly You always say that, and I almost never know.
dwight What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
kelly Are you accusing me of something?
dwight Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
jim
 OK.
dwight Ah!
jim Easy.
dwight OK.
jim Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
kelly You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
dwight The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
kelly Dwight, get out of my nook!
pam That's what she said! That's what she said! That's what she said!
jim Good one.
jim Hey. Sorry about Dwight, by the way.
kelly Yeah, he's weird.
jim Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but.
kelly OK.
jim Hey, how are you and Darryl?
kelly Um, we're cool. Bye.
jim Bye.
pam That was weird.
jim What was?
pam Have you ever had a conversation with kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?
jim No, actually.
pam Did you do something to her?
jim I don't think so.
pam Well, something's off.
jim Hey, how's things?
ryan All right.
jim Yeah?
ryan Living in the moment.
jim Do you have any reason to believe that kelly would be mad at me?
ryan I don't play the politics game anymore, Jim. Can I tell you something? I played it full on in New York. I played it high stakes. For keeps. Made it to the top. But look what it cost. Can I tell you what else I learned?
jim Wait, that's pretty weird.
ryan What?
jim Well, andy has a mug just like that.
ryan Oh, yeah, kelly gave them out as party favors. Remember? You got one.
jim No. What party?
ryan Her America's Got Talent finale party over the summer. That's crazy. It was packed. I thought everyone was there. You were there. I remember you being there.
jim I wasn't. But thank you. Do you know anything about this party?
pam Yes, I said you definitely should go, but you wanted to visit me instead.
jim Well, I can't be the only one who didn't --
jim 
jim Dwight, let me see your coffee cup.
dwight No.
jim Is that it?
dwight No. Why? No.
jim OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the
thing I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.
dwight Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
jim Probably just Kelly.
dwight Obviously. I knew it.
jim That's what I'm saying.
dwight Yeah. What?
jim You were right.
dwight I was -- I was right.
jim You were right.
dwight I was right.
jim You knew it.
dwight I knew it.
jim You knew it the whole time, buddy.
dwight I knew it the whole time, buddy!
jim Wow.
dwight Yeah! Woo-hoo!
pam Right dwight is loud.
dwight I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! Boom! kelly the whole time. Let's get her.
jim No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
kelly What's going on?
michael Why don't you tell us?
kelly Nothing's going on.
dwight Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
michael Dwight. I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
kelly What? I -- I don't know what you're talking about. This is the first I'm hearing about this.
dwight Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
jim We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
michael What's going on?
kelly I love your tie, Michael.
michael Kelly.
kelly I was raped.
michael You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
kelly OK, all right. OK, I did it. All right? I lied, whatever. Just fire me. But you know what? I did it because you guys didn't come to my party, and you said you would try to and then you didn't even show up, and so you're bad friends.
dwight We have our confession. I'm calling security.
michael Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
kelly See? I wasn't lying.
michael You were lying.
kelly I was lying.
michael Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
dwight I want to be here when you fire her ass.
michael I will call you when it is time.
michael I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
kelly No problem.
michael I think you should do that.
alex pam Beesley?
pam Hey, what are you doing here?
jim Who's that?
pam It's Alex.
alex It's Pam. Uh, I came to kidnap you. There's free wine and cheese at the Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go.
jim Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
pam Oh, I love Chuck Close and his photo-realist paintings. But I have to work.
alex Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?
pam OK.
jim That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
alex Um.
pam What's up?
alex I'm gonna take a big leap and I want to tell you that I think you should not move back to Scranton.
pam Wow.
jim I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
alex Why did you come to New York in the first place?
pam Because they have a great design program, and I wanted to see if I was any good at it. And I wanted to work on my art, too.
alex Right. And that's why I think that you should stay here. Because I mean, you -- really you just got here, you know? You can't do New York in three months. You know, it has everything. It has -- all the opportunity is here. All the -- the whole art scene is in New York. You know, it would be nuts to go back to Scranton without getting to fully experience it.
pam Jim's in Scranton.
alex I know. But all I'm saying is, if there's even a teeny, tiny part of you that really wants to be an artist, then I think you should stay here, because you don't want to wake up in 50 years and look back and wonder what could have been. And that is the end of my speech. I planned it all. Anyway . I will see you tomorrow.
pam I'll see you tomorrow.
alex OK.
dwight Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? May I?
jim Don't.
dwight Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
andy We haven't decided on anything yet. We're still reviewing some options, and it's gonna come down to the numbers.
dwight Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials?
andy Oh. Hmm.
dwight While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
andy That's very generous.
dwight While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
andy Oh, thank the good Lord. Deal!
dwight OK.
andy Um, what are we talking price wise?
dwight You already said deal.
angela Pay him whatever he wants.
andy Can't argue with that. dwight . You are going to make us so happy.
