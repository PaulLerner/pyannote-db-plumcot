ryan No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
pam Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
ryan Smokey's dead.
pam Smokey, the bear?
ryan Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
jim Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
ryan Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
jim Well, I second that emotion.
ryan Huh?
nellie I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
ryan Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, "Tracks of my Tears"?
nellie Yeah
ryan Um. God, so many, Nellie!
pam No, no, no, "Tracks of My Tears" and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
ryan Okay, I'm not. I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
pam I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
ryan Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
dwight You don't like the Beatles?
ryan That's. That's not the point!
dwight Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
ryan Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
oscar It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
ryan Okay well, that's a relief!
jim Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
pam Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
jim Tickets are 250 bucks.
pam 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
ryan Yeah. Who's opening?
jim Paul Anka.
ryan Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
jim Okay, you could just show up late though.
ryan How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
pam Tears of a clown!
ryan Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
darryl Looking good, RC!
robert Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation s*x club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
angela Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight. I'm sure it will be fine.
angela My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
dwight I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
jim Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people.
oscar What's going on?
dwight There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
erin Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
dwight That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops!
pam Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
phyllis How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
dwight I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
nellie I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
andy Hey!
erin Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
angela We think you might kill Robert.
andy What?
kevin because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
andy guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
pam Oh, great! That sounds good!
kevin Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
andy Why would that be weird?
kevin It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
erin Andy's just coming as my date.
kevin Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
nellie Come in!
darryl You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
nellie Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
darryl I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
nellie How are things in the warehouse?
darryl You could go downstairs and ask them?
nellie The warehouse isn't downstairs? Is it? Is it?
darryl Who knew, right?
nellie I.
nellie Tonight could be the night that darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
angela Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
andy Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
kevin Oh man, this is weird!
robert Andrew.
andy Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! I had you, I had you!
andy Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm. Great!
kevin Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
creed Well, I don't want to get raped Twenty-Two!
kevin No! It was my idea to not be raped!
dwight Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
kevin Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
dwight You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
kevin So dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
andy What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
jim Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
andy The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
pam Sounds like you're doing alright.
andy Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
ryan Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
senator You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
oscar my dog Gerald is my life.
senator really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9. Excuse me.
oscar This confirms three
things I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
robert I stepped in right away and start--
andy Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
robert Well.
andy You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
robert So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
andy Evil! although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
robert and the hero, who's that based on?
andy Me, I guess. We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
meredith Hey jabroni. Show some class.
stanley She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
andy You're being a Thomas Oregon!
robert Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
andy Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
robert andy you should leave. Now.
andy Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
waiter I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.
andy then I'll take a table!
waiter Okay
andy And a high five! Oh, let's do this again!
andy Oh, yes indeed. When! Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! When!
oscar I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
pam Oh my god!
oscar I know!
jim Wait, what? Come on!
oscar We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
jim Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
oscar Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
jim Okay, what was this look?
pam Whoa!
jim What happened, did he do it?
pam Are you-- Twice! For real?
jim Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
pam Life is Downton Abbey.
jim Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
dwight How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
dwight It's $475! Like candy from a baby! . push;
andy Hey. david Wallace!
david andy Bernard!
andy Hey, how are you?
david How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
andy No, got canned last week.
david Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
andy No, best thing that ever happened to me.
david That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
andy Yikes!
david Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
nellie Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers. Or Oreos. Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
darryl Tacos.
nellie What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
darryl I can go get us some tacos.
nellie Brilliant!
darryl If you loan me some money.
nellie Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20. $20? Or $25? $20?
darryl $30.
nellie $30, yes!
nellie I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
oscar So?
jim Boom!
oscar This is interesting.
pam Hm-hmm.
jim what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
pam Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
oscar He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
pam Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
jim Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
speaker Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. robert California!
robert Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
andy can you believe this guy?
robert The state senator, robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes!
andy Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
robert Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
andy I will! I will take all of those dogs!
robert Andy, that's very kind--
andy No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
robert andy why don't we discuss this at a--
andy No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
erin Oh God!
senator Mr. Bernard, right this way.
andy Okay! Hope you all learned something!
vet Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh. I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream.
andy I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
vet Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.
andy Stupid dog.
senator Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number.
meredith Thank you!
pam Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
oscar sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
oscar No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
darryl Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
nellie Oh, great! Okay, oh. Oh, these tacos!
darryl Hmhmm.
nellie Mmm! Uhh Mmmm. Oh! Hmmph!
darryl She's trying.
speaker The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is dwight Schrute!
dwight Yes! Thank you!
speaker The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is dwight Schrute!
dwight Oh yes! Yeah!
speaker A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to dwight Schrute!
dwight Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
speaker Well, I think I can save us some time, dwight Schrute has won every single item here!
dwight Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
speaker Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars!
jim Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
dwight Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing. And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you
something when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night!
senator Oscar!
oscar Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
senator It was lovely! And don't forget to call.
oscar okay
senator thanks so much for coming
oscar why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for angela
andy so it just goes on under here like this?
vet that's right!
andy Ugh, oh god!
vet Yeah, you never get used to that.
jim Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
andy I am so great!
erin He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
jim Look at that one though, he's smiling!
vet Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle.
andy This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
pam Absolutely, it's awesome--
jim Yes--
kevin I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
andy You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
vet Maybe you would think it too! I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations.
jim Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
pam Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
andy Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
jim Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
andy Yeah, I do. I have that.
jim Yeah
erin You're going to be alright
kevin No. No he's not.
andy Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
kevin You're welcome!
kevin Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
erin So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
darryl Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
kevin My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
pam What do you feed her?
kevin Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
darryl Is she sick? How are her poops?
kevin Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
pam Does she smell?
kevin She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
kevin People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
