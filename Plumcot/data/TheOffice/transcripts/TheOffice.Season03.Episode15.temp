michael Hello everyone! As you know, we are six days away from Phyllis' wedding. So get your suits to the dry cleaner and get your hair did. And Karen, um, you might want to invest in a dress or a skirt of some kind if you don't already have one. This may be Phyllis' only wedding ever. It is my job to ensure that none of you look like ragamuffins. So I am instituting prima nocta.
jim Prima nocta, I believe from the movie Braveheart, and confirmed on wikipedia, is when the king got to deflower every new bride on her wedding night. So.
michael I'm sorry. I had a very different understanding as to what prima nocta meant.
michael I'm trying to get everyone excited about Phyllis' wedding because I want her to get people excited about my wedding when the time comes. Which won't be hard, because it's going to be awesome. A lot better than hers, that's for sure. It'll probably be on a boat.
michael What's up spinsters?
angela Nothing. You know this is a luncheon shower. Girls only.

karen So I guess you have the Ben franklin wig and the costume and you figure, how can I put this to practical use?

karen Hey um, I wanted to talk to you. I know this is weird or whatever, but jim told me about you guys.
pam What do you mean?
karen Well that you kissed. And we talked it through and it's totally fine, it's not a big deal. It's just a kiss. Wait- you're not still interested in him?

franklin You know Michael, I fathered an illegitimate son.
michael Really. Ben
franklin But I kept all this from my wife Deborah. These things only serve to upset the women. They are the gentler s*x.
michael Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.
michael Stripper? Could I ask you a question about women? Um, should I tell my girlfriend that you danced up on me?
elizabeth Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone.
michael Wow. Thank you.

jan Okay.
michael I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
jan Uh when, when did, when last night?
michael No, today at work.
jan You went to a bachelor party at work?
michael Yes. I kind of arranged it.
kelly Well I don't even think the stripper was that hot. Do you guys think she was hot?
ryan kelly don't do this.
kelly Do what? I just asked you a question.
ryan You know what you're doing.
kelly Anyway, do you know who was totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam.
jim Really? Looks like I hired the right guy. I'm glad. Any real potential there Beesley?
pam Yeah, right. God, I need a boyfriend. You know ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends. Whenever.

michael That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?
jan I'll talk to you later.
michael You are. You are.
michael So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep? Ben Franklin. And elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice. Which rhymed. Really makes you wonder how Ben franklin can become president, but someone like elizabeth can't.
dwight Are you near sighted or far sighted? Ben
franklin Both. That's why I invented the bifocal.
dwight GAH!!!
