michael Hey, you ready?
michael All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent, excellent.
dwight Michael!
michael Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun. " And so I started messing around and. I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So. you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
michael Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
dwight Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
michael No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
dwight Oh, please.
michael When I let him come to my pick-up game.
dwight I apologized for that.
michael I vouched for you.
dwight Michael, I.
michael I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
dwight I can handle that.
michael Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
dwight And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
michael Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
dwight Same thing.
michael No, it's not. It's lower, so.
dwight It's close.
dwight So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be. Jim.
jim God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
phyllis Keep me out of it.
pam My fiance has plans for us this Saturday. So I really hope that dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.
michael All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.
ryan Fine, don't worry about that.
michael And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood. " Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
lonny What's up?
michael And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
darryl It's not my real name.
michael No, it's Darryl. darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
ryan darryl Rogers?
darryl darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
michael And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
ryan Yeah, yeah.
michael You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!
pam No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.
jim pam gets a little down. Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set. and that was three years ago.
michael So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.
darryl We're loading at one.
michael Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
darryl No, we got a truck going out at 115. So, that's the busy time.
michael Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way.
darryl All right, fine, you know what? One o'clock.
michael All right, see you at one.
michael Are we ready for the game?
everybody Yeah.
michael I. yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
dwight Gimli.
michael Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
dwight Just trying to be helpful.
michael Uh, "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword. "
jim That's him.
michael OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? stanley of course.
stanley I'm sorry?
michael Um, what do you play? Center?
stanley Why "of course"?
michael Uh.
stanley What's that supposed to mean?
michael Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
jim Uh, I heard it.

phyllis I'd like to play if it's just for fun. I played basketball in school.
michael Um. Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
ryan But, I'm getting paid to skip lunch?
michael Yes.
ryan OK.

michael Off the backboard!
pam Please don't throw garbage at me.
michael Oh, pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
pam I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.
jim I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and.
michael Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
pam Maybe angela would cheerlead.
michael Oh, yeah right.
phyllis I'll do it.
michael Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. . 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
michael Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
darryl Just getting a tea bag.
michael Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
darryl Why don't we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley's.
michael Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
darryl No, that's not as much fun. You know what?
michael What?
