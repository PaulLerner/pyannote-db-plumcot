Cookie#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode22 Monster Oscar, Toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I'm sitting on them.
andy_bernard This is awesome!
oscar_martinez Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Cookie#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode22 Monster What's the difference between a chimichanga, a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It's urgent.
kevin_malone This isn't funny. I don't talk like that.
phyllis_vance Say "Me eat cookie."
kevin_malone No. I won't say it.
dwight_schrute Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
ryan_howard It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
dwight_schrute Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
phyllis_vance Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute I love that show.
Cookie#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode22 Monster This is Kevin. This is Kevin.
ryan_howard Good work, buddy.
oscar_martinez Thank you.
dwight_schrute That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
oscar_martinez Yes.
kelly_kapoor Me, too Oscar.
ryan_howard C.C. me
kevin_malone Angela, this is inappropriate.
angela_martin This is my favorite day.
andy_bernard It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. . Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago. And a Stern reminder via fax at 7 00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
meredith_palmer Here you go.
erin_hannon Oh, thank you.
andy_bernard I do.
dwight_schrute
erin_hannon Thank you.
andy_bernard If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
erin_hannon Welcome back!
pam_beesly Hey, thanks.
pam_beesly It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
pam_beesly Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
jim_halpert I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
dwight_schrute Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
pam_beesly It's nice to see you again, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hello, Pam.
andy_bernard I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
michael_scott I'm going to give Erin $15.
erin_hannon I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
michael_scott A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
andy_bernard Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. .
michael_scott She's kind of a rube.
andy_bernard That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
michael_scott Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
andy_bernard She's gonna be so psyched.
michael_scott Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
erin_hannon Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
michael_scott I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
erin_hannon I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
michael_scott Ugh.
erin_hannon Just the two of us.
michael_scott Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
erin_hannon Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
michael_scott Okay, well, we'll figure something.
erin_hannon Oh.
michael_scott Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
erin_hannon Okay.
michael_scott All right.
meredith_palmer Have a cookie, Kev.
kevin_malone Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
darryl_philbin I brought those in. It's my birthday. That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
kevin_malone Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. Happy Birthday.
darryl_philbin Thank you.
darryl_philbin Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
kevin_malone They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
kevin_malone Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
gabe_lewis This is violent and offensive.
kevin_malone Thank you. It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
gabe_lewis It's awful.
kevin_malone I'm not crying.
gabe_lewis You have some food on your face.
kevin_malone Do my hands feel sweaty to you?
gabe_lewis The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
gabe_lewis Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
kevin_malone Yeah.
gabe_lewis And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
michael_scott Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
erin_hannon I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
michael_scott I don't know.
erin_hannon I would have chosen the 1490's.
michael_scott Ahhh.
erin_hannon 'Cause America was discovered.
michael_scott Right.
erin_hannon And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
michael_scott An age or month?
erin_hannon Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
michael_scott I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
erin_hannon How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
michael_scott So how are things going with Andy?
erin_hannon He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
michael_scott Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
erin_hannon Yeah I love that.
michael_scott Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
erin_hannon What?
michael_scott I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.
erin_hannon Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
michael_scott Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
waiter Here we go. Hot plate.
michael_scott Okay.
waiter And your salad, miss.
erin_hannon Why wouldn't he tell me that?
michael_scott I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having s*x with somebody else.
erin_hannon They had s*x?
michael_scott They were engaged, so... Okay, you know what, sir?
waiter Yes?
michael_scott Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
waiter Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles.
michael_scott Thank you.
erin_hannon Uhhhh, they were engaged?
michael_scott Mm-hmm. Yeah.
erin_hannon Uh-oh...
michael_scott Well...
erin_hannon
michael_scott What are you doing? What are you doing?
erin_hannon In the Foster home, my hair was my room.
michael_scott Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
erin_hannon
michael_scott I'll have what she's having!
michael_scott Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
pam_beesly Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
jim_halpert What's up?
dwight_schrute Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
jim_halpert Dwight, don't be gross.
pam_beesly No, no, he's right.
dwight_schrute Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
pam_beesly That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
dwight_schrute All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
pam_beesly You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
dwight_schrute Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
pam_beesly Mm. Meredith!
meredith_palmer I just like the way it feels.
pam_beesly What are you doing?!
meredith_palmer Just relax. Okay.
pam_beesly Relax?!
meredith_palmer This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
pam_beesly Give it back to me now.
meredith_palmer Okay, I was just warming it up.
pam_beesly It's disgusting!
meredith_palmer It's not a big deal.
pam_beesly It's not sterile!
meredith_palmer We're both girls. Who cares?
andy_bernard So... how was lunch?
erin_hannon Lunch was fine.
andy_bernard Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
erin_hannon I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
andy_bernard Well, I know. Just want... I mean...
oscar_martinez Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
erin_hannon God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
kelly_kapoor "My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant." See I did the voice.
ryan_howard That's a little derivative.
kelly_kapoor But parody is always derivative.
ryan_howard Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
pam_beesly Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
jim_halpert Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall."
gabe_lewis Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
jim_halpert "Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies."
gabe_lewis Ok.
andy_bernard Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
michael_scott You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
andy_bernard I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
michael_scott No. No. No.
andy_bernard Specific shout-out..
michael_scott Stop talking.
andy_bernard Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
erin_hannon I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
michael_scott Oh God.
andy_bernard Can we talk about this in private?
erin_hannon I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
andy_bernard Yes.
erin_hannon Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
pam_beesly No, no never.
erin_hannon Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
dwight_schrute Yeah pretty much.
erin_hannon Who are you?! I don't know you!
gabe_lewis I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
kevin_malone Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
erin_hannon Thanks.
kevin_malone So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
pam_beesly "Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful."
gabe_lewis Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
pam_beesly What? What do you mean, suspend me?
jim_halpert I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
gabe_lewis Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. Ok fine. You too Dwight.
dwight_schrute Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
gabe_lewis I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
kevin_malone "C" is for suspension.
andy_bernard Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
michael_scott Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
andy_bernard I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
michael_scott You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
andy_bernard Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
angela_martin Psst. Hey. Erin.
erin_hannon You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
angela_martin You embarrassed me earlier.
erin_hannon Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
angela_martin You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
erin_hannon I want to throw up just thinking about it.
angela_martin You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
toby_flenderson I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
pam_beesly Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
erin_hannon Really?
pam_beesly Yeah. And he worked here too.
erin_hannon It was Andy, wasn't it?
pam_beesly No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
erin_hannon I hope you find what you're looking for.
pam_beesly Thank you.
gabe_lewis So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
pam_beesly Hey Toby.
toby_flenderson I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
pam_beesly Very interesting.
toby_flenderson Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
pam_beesly Thanks Toby.
gabe_lewis Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
pam_beesly I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
jim_halpert And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
dwight_schrute Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. Gabriel, I apologize.
gabe_lewis Great.
dwight_schrute I kneel before you.
gabe_lewis Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
dwight_schrute Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
gabe_lewis Guys, to err is human.
erin_hannon Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
andy_bernard Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
erin_hannon How long were you guys together?
andy_bernard A year.
erin_hannon A year? You were together for a year?
andy_bernard Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
erin_hannon I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
andy_bernard I didn't see that movie.
gabe_lewis That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
kelly_kapoor Do they still get paid?
gabe_lewis It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
oscar_martinez Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
meredith_palmer Pathetic.
gabe_lewis Can I buy everyone coffees? "Or cookies."
dwight_schrute What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
gabe_lewis Alright.
kevin_malone Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
gabe_lewis You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
dwight_schrute "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit."
kevin_malone "Ciao" Right? "Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee."
gabe_lewis Why don't we say ciao to the impressions?
erin_hannon
michael_scott Erin?
erin_hannon Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
michael_scott No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
erin_hannon I can't trust Andy anymore.
michael_scott Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
erin_hannon It's Andy's fault.
michael_scott Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
erin_hannon Oh, I like his butt.
michael_scott You said butt.
erin_hannon You tricked me!
michael_scott Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him "Hey! Hey Scott!"
andy_bernard Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
oscar_martinez from the computer Hey Kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost.
kevin_malone I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
phyllis_vance I don't get it.
jim_halpert Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
pam_beesly Yeah. "I vant to count to ten".
kevin_malone But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
kelly_kapoor But you're an accountant too.
oscar_martinez Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
pam_beesly That would have been funny.
kevin_malone But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
michael_scott Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count." Nailed him. Nailed him. Good work Cookie Monster.
kevin_malone Thank you.
