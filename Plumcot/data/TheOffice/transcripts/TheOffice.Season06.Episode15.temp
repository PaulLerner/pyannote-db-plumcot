michael Oh, yeah. I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?
erin I got a big box, yes I do. I got a big box how 'bout you?
oscar I think you don't know what you're saying.
michael It's from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me.
michael Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses. Although david wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.
michael Oh! Wow. Awesome. For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.
dwight Here we go. Oh! Wow.
michael Cool. What next?
erin Guys, um, who's Gabe? This note says to put the box aside for gabe Lewis, who's coming tomorrow?
michael Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -
dwight Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
michael Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened.
dwight Terrible mistake.
michael And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
dwight Undistributable.
pam Well, maybe we can put the box back together.
dwight Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
oscar I think we can do it.
pam Yep, yep.
oscar Right? Mm. Did we try printer first? Shredder at an angle -
pam Yep.
oscar Fax, cable, then the scanner upside down?
pam Yes.
creed Have you tried making everything smaller?
michael And - Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves.
pam Oh, Michael.
michael Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.
pam No, don't!
michael Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
michael Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
pam What do you want us to do?
michael Why do I have to explain everything?
pam Because we're usually not on the same page.
michael Okay.
gabe Oh. Okay. And to you.
michael gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with david Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
dwight Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
michael You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
gabe Um, hi, uh, my name is gabe Lewis. I am coordinating director for merging regions.
michael Hello, Gabe. I am michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, jim Halpert.
jim Co-manager, actually.
michael In training.
jim Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So.
gabe We are very impressed with this branch and we are so excited about this merger.
michael We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
dwight So excited.
michael We have a little song prepared for you.
gabe Um, actually, if you don't mind, I would love to put this on the Sabre website.
michael Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
dwight Oh. Of course.
michael Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
andy Ok. andy &amp;
erin Hopped off the train in Scranton, PA, another cloudy gray afternoon. Jumped in the cab, here you are for the first time, look to the right see the "Electric City" sign. This is gonna be good day, for Dunder Mifflin and Sob-ray. Sab -
michael Saber.
andy Saber. Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. andy &amp;
erin Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sob-ray. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay. Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre.
andy You sure it's saber?
pam Hey.
jim Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11
 20.
pam Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.
jim Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.
pam We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.
jim Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
pam We're hoping our interview seals the deal.
jim But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
pam Okay. Okay. Yeah. Christian
slater So you've just been bought by Sabre. You've probably got a lot of questions. Hi. I'm Christian Slater. What's it like to work for Sabre? Let's find out together. Working at Sabre means taking on the challenge of the road that rises to meet you. Sabre is respecting the past, but opening a window to the future. Have you ever tasted a rainbow? At Sabre, you will. jo
bennett You'll find it easy to embrace the Sabre spirit. Welcome. We're very excited to go on this journey with you.
jim So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, "What's going on?" Well, you're not alone.
michael Wow. Really terrific.
gabe Most of our business comes from selling printers. So don't think of yourselves as paper salesmen anymore, but as printer salesmen who also sell paper.
michael Perfect.
michael No. Don't like that.
gabe At Sabre, we really encourage honest communication. You should always feel free to express your thoughts, your -
meredith Talk about vacation days!
gabe We have a policy here at Sabre where we are, uh, allowed to take two weeks.
oscar But I banked six weeks.
angela I already booked a Great Lakes cruise.
meredith Hey, who the hell's going through our stuff?
gabe Actually, that's Nick. He's your new IT guy. Uh, he's setting up a site blocker. Mostly blocking the inappropriate sites. And then there are the time-wasting sites like Twitter, YouTube. We are blocking those as well.
michael Mm, nope. Don't like that.
gabe Ok, did everyone get one? With these bottles, we eliminate the need for plastic water bottles, which are the scourge of the environment.
michael We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
gabe Little cups? Like paper or plastic or. ?
michael I don't know what they're made of.
dwight They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
gabe Ok, well, I bet you can fit 20 little cups of water in your aluminum bottle.
michael You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
stanley That's ok.
michael There is a small part of me that is actually very excited about this new company. But 70 percent of me is water, and the other part, the real part, the part that has feelings and emotions and thoughts and makes decisions and, if I can be crass, makes babies, that part thinks that all of these changes suck ba -
michael Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?
toby Oop.
michael What?
toby Looks like we kicked it.
michael I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.
michael I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.
gabe Oh, I don't get that sense at all from you, so.
michael Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.
gabe Which ones?
michael all of them.
gabe Well, I wish that I could do something, but it's kind of policy, you know? Above my pay grade. You know?
michael So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
gabe You know what? Let me see what I can do.
jim Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.
pam There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?
jim Oh. Adorable, right? I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
pam What?
jim I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
pam Who? The -
jim I don't know. I don't know.
pam The guy we're meeting with?
jim I don't know, I don't know.
andy I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.
erin Well, I saw them in there.
andy Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, "Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries. "
erin I think when andy finally asks me out he's going to try to top what he did with the drum line. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.
andy The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.
gabe First let me say that I told them everything you wanted me to say, in just the way you wanted me to say it, so.
jo Gabe, honey, I love this. I love the sound of your voice. But I really need some new information now.
gabe Ok, um, I told the story of your uncle, and I have a feeling that you would have really been proud of the way. Okay, um.
jo Wait a minute, who is it? Who's there? Is there somebody in the room with you? I want to see who it is. Turn me around.
gabe I don't - it's just.
jo Turn me around. Now. Hey, Buddy. Is it something I said?
michael Hello. No. My name's michael Scott. Hello.
jo Oh, hello, Mr. Scott. Pleased to meet you.
michael Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
jo Aw, thank you. I've been working on it since I was a little girl. To, um, to what do I owe the pleasure of this videochat?
michael Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
jo Pardon. Pardon me, Mr. Scott, but the last time I saw a company as mismanaged as Dunder Mifflin, it was my grandson's snowball company, so you'll excuse me if I prefer that you all adapt to the way that we do things.
michael Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian slater back there? Because. he knows. He'd know what to do.
jo So listen, why don't you tell gabe if by the end of the day you can't handle the changes.
michael I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
jo I would take until the end of the day if I were you. . push;
jerry pam and Jim? Hey, I'm Jerry.
pam Hi Jerry.
jim Jerry.
jerry Good to see you. Come on in. My office is right back here. This is the play room.
jim This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
jerry Oh, so you saw it already?
jim No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.
pam It's lovely.
jerry Oh. Got to take this. Sorry.
jim Do it.
jerry Okay. Hi, this is Jerry.
pam Ok, you've got to pull it together.
jim We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
pam He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.
jim What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
pam That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.
jerry Sorry about that. Right this way.
jim all right.
michael I have come here today to talk to Mr. david wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? Hey. Hi, sorry.
david Michael.
michael I hope you're not busy doing something.
david No, you kidding? Come on in. Come on.
michael You sure?
david You look great.
michael You look great too.
david You hungry? I'm just having lunch.
michael Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
david Fantastic. Teddy, look who just stopped in. teddy
wallace Huh? Hey.
michael Hey. Wow.
david Keep it up, son.
michael Really loud.
michael Wow. Oh, yummy. You have got the life, my friend.
david Yeah.
michael Can I just stay here and never go back?
david Things not going so well there?
michael Oh, man. How much time do you have?
david I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.
michael Yeah. Mrs.
wallace Hey, honey. How's your day going? Did you do anything cool?
david Uh, no, sweetie. I just sort of hung out. Mrs.
wallace Oh, 'cause I saw you had shoes on, so I didn't know if you did anything.
david No. Just hanging out, honey. You remember Michael.
michael Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see. Mrs.
wallace No problem at all. This is great. So what are you guys up to?
michael I don't know.
david Uh, but maybe, uh - actually, you know, I think maybe we'll go outside. May -maybe we'll go outside. Outside.
jim There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.
jerry That seems a bit premature, don't you think? I don't even know if I have a space for you yet, and you're already lining up your holiday plans.
jim Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.
jerry Yeah, if the time comes, we can discuss it.
pam Is this because jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?
jim What?
jerry Seriously? You told her?
jim Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.
jerry And you - you thought that might have something to do with how the meeting is going?
jim No.
pam Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.
jerry Well, you didn't consider the fact that it might not be going super well just because it might not be going super well?
pam Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.
jerry I'm being perfectly pleasant. Did you ever consider that you might not be as charming as you think you are?
jim Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
jerry It doesn't lock for the children's safety.
jim Anybody could have walked in.
jerry It was story time.
michael Sabre is changing everything. Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? david wallace would know what to do. What should I do, david Wallace?
david I don't know. I mean, what can you do?
michael Exactly. What are you thinking?
david I, I - It's a tough one.
michael It is a tough one.
david I don't have any ideas for you there.
michael Yeah. But one would be good.
david Hey, oh, okay. Wait.
michael Okay.
david I want to tell you about a business idea I have.
michael Okay.
david Ok? You know how kids leave their toys everywhere? Okay. So this is a vacuum. It's like a shop-vac type of thing. Teaches kids how to pick up their own toys. Right? Baseball gloves, hacky sacks, drumsticks. Picks it up!
michael So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
david No. No, no, no. That's the -that's the vacuum noise.
michael Oh, okay.
david You-you don't like it.
michael No, I think it is-
david No, it's ok. Another guy from Dunder Mifflin, Arnie from Research, he's gonna draw up the prototype. And, uh. It's like shop-vac. Did I say that?
michael Yep.
david It'll be ok.
andy Hey, any fun weekend plans?
erin No, you?
andy Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?
erin Nothing. It's wide open.
andy Okay.
andy That's as hard as I can hint.
david Hey, you know, if you want, I'm sure I can get Arnie on board if you wanted to join us for suck it. Work together again.
michael The what?
david Suck it. That's what it's called.
michael Oh, okay.
david Huh? Catchy. Kids'll love it.
michael Like it.
michael There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with david Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.
michael See you later.
david Oh, Michael.
michael Bye now.
david Thank you for coming.
michael Thanks for having me.
michael Well, that's not the david wallace that I remember. That is some sort of weird creature that lives in david Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.
michael Hello. Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.
michael You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.
michael Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.
everyone Yes. Yes, you are. You make a lot.
michael But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
angela That's your toast?
michael No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
phyllis Michael, this isn't a toast. You're just thinking out loud.
michael Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
kevin Just 'cause you have liquid that doesn't make it a toast.
michael Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
all To us and to Sabre.
michael Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
david Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
