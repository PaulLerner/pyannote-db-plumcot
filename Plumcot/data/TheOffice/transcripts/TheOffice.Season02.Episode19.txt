michael_scott So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
oscar_martinez Who is this guy again?
michael_scott Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
ryan_howard Who uses calling cards anymore?
michael_scott You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
oscar_martinez This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
michael_scott Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
toby_flenderson Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
michael_scott You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. Alright.
jim_halpert No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
michael_scott Alright, let me explain. Again. Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... ... I have to go make a call.
pam_beesly Happy birthday Michael.
michael_scott Oh ho ho! What?
pam_beesly I said happy birthday.
michael_scott Thank you! That's really nice.
michael_scott Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a perfect ice-breaker if I ever meet Terry Hatcher.
michael_scott What's up?
jim_halpert Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
michael_scott Ah, thank you sir.
meredith_palmer Did you hear anything yet?
kevin_malone No. I'm still waiting.
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
michael_scott Ohh, god.
dwight_schrute Birthday hug!
michael_scott No no no, no, new suit, please.
dwight_schrute That suit is amazing.
michael_scott Thank you very much. It is from Italy. Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
dwight_schrute Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
michael_scott Good luck. One of a kind.
dwight_schrute Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
michael_scott Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
dwight_schrute Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
michael_scott Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
dwight_schrute Let's get the party started.
michael_scott Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you!
phyllis_vance When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
pam_beesly One's good.
angela_martin One thirty. I'm sorry, are we boring you?
dwight_schrute Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
phyllis_vance Where do we get those?
dwight_schrute Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by.
pam_beesly Michael wants a strippergram?
dwight_schrute Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
angela_martin No. This is a closed door meeting.
michael_scott Yeah?
pam_beesly Michael, I have Jan on the line.
michael_scott Oh, great, put her through.
jan_levinson Hello, Michael.
michael_scott Hey, you.
jan_levinson I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
michael_scott It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
jan_levinson Well, today's not my birthday, so...
michael_scott Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
jan_levinson ...Happy birthday, Michael.
michael_scott Thanks.
jan_levinson Am I on camera?
michael_scott Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart.
michael_scott ...You can take a five, if you want.
michael_scott Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
stanley_hudson Mmhmm, happy birthday.
michael_scott Thanks.
jim_halpert Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
kevin_malone They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
jim_halpert Oh, okay.
kelly_kapoor Second opinion on what?
kevin_malone Um, I might have skin cancer.
kelly_kapoor Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and he had skin cancer too.
jim_halpert Kelly, you know what...
kelly_kapoor I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
toby_flenderson Who brought in donuts?
michael_scott Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
toby_flenderson Happy birthday!
michael_scott You didn't know it was my birthday.
toby_flenderson I... guess I forgot.
michael_scott Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut .
toby_flenderson Are you serious?
michael_scott Mmm.
oscar_martinez Skin cancer is treatable.
kevin_malone Right.
oscar_martinez It's going to be okay.
angela_martin You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
delivery_boy Woman Hi, delivery for Michael Scott.
michael_scott Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
delivery_boy Woman Uh... s-sure.
michael_scott Okay. I'm so nervous.
pam_beesly I can sign for it.
delivery_boy Woman Oh. Thanks.
michael_scott When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
michael_scott Stop it. Stop! What is that?
dwight_schrute It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
michael_scott Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
dwight_schrute I probably care more than she does.
michael_scott You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .
pam_beesly When does he hear?
jim_halpert Sometime today.
pam_beesly Ohh... poor Kevin.
pam_beesly If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
dwight_schrute Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on back... order... Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute Listen up everyone! It is 11 23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
michael_scott Ohhh, God.
dwight_schrute There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
michael_scott Ohhh, no.
dwight_schrute So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
oscar_martinez ...I'll do it.
michael_scott Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
dwight_schrute Creed! Come on. Stanley!
pam_beesly ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
jim_halpert Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
dwight_schrute On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute Happy birth moment, Michael.
michael_scott Thank you.
dwight_schrute One. Two. Three!
michael_scott Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
dwight_schrute Oscar...
oscar_martinez It wasn't me.
dwight_schrute Okay, that is not an eight foot sub.
delivery_boy Boy Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs.
dwight_schrute F. Alright, what's the damage?
delivery_boy Boy Uh, thirty-nine sixty.
dwight_schrute Thirty nine... sixty.
dwight_schrute Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
dwight_schrute Here they come.
michael_scott Get in here... everybody.
dwight_schrute Come and get it!
michael_scott Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
oscar_martinez What is this?
dwight_schrute Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
michael_scott The best.
stanley_hudson These are all the same?
michael_scott Yes.
angela_martin Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
michael_scott Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
angela_martin No.
michael_scott Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
angela_martin No.
michael_scott Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. And choke on it.
michael_scott When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... That was the worst birthday I think I ever had.
jim_halpert So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
pam_beesly Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
jim_halpert Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
pam_beesly And his favorite lunch.
dwight_schrute Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left .
ryan_howard Someone ate three feet of that thing?
dwight_schrute Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
angela_martin Oh. Thank you.
dwight_schrute Oh. I got it.
angela_martin What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
dwight_schrute This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
angela_martin Fine.
dwight_schrute What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
angela_martin Yes... but don't expect any cookie.
dwight_schrute But what if i'm hungry?
angela_martin No cookie.
jim_halpert ...What?
pam_beesly You use fabric softener?
jim_halpert Yeah, you don't?
pam_beesly No, I do.
jim_halpert ...Okay.
Office#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode19 Staff Happy birthday dear Michael, Happy birthday... ...tooo youuuu.
kevin_malone Hello? Hey.
michael_scott Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
kevin_malone No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. It was just Stacy.
michael_scott Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
dwight_schrute Here we go. Make a wish.
michael_scott Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...
dwight_schrute Yaoo yay!
michael_scott ... I asked for trick candles.
dwight_schrute Pam was supposed to get 'em.
michael_scott Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
angela_martin No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
michael_scott ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us .
pam_beesly We should probably head back.
jim_halpert Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
pam_beesly You dare me? How old are you?
jim_halpert Just... quit stalling.
pam_beesly Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
jim_halpert Such a dork.
pam_beesly Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
store_manager Employee Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.
pam_beesly Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
jim_halpert How old are you?
pam_beesly I hate you.
toby_flenderson Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
michael_scott There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
kevin_malone Still scary.
michael_scott Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
kevin_malone Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
michael_scott And laughter... also.
toby_flenderson I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
michael_scott Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
toby_flenderson I work here.
michael_scott Nyeh, I work here. Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
kevin_malone If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
michael_scott Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
dwight_schrute Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
jim_halpert Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
dwight_schrute Please, don't.
jim_halpert You... owe me.
michael_scott Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
stanley_hudson Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
michael_scott How dare you sir. You are gross.
michael_scott That should not be there.
dwight_schrute I'll get someone to take it down.
michael_scott No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
kelly_kapoor Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
ryan_howard Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
jim_halpert Think you can let go?
pam_beesly No.
jim_halpert Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
dwight_schrute YEAH!
pam_beesly Who is that?
jim_halpert Is that Michael?
michael_scott Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
pam_beesly I got it.
michael_scott Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
jim_halpert ...It's something to think about.
kevin_malone I can't relax about it, you know?
michael_scott Kevin. You heard anything yet?
kevin_malone No, not yet.
michael_scott Okay. Well. Live strong.
kevin_malone Okay, Michael.
michael_scott Alright.
carol_stills Michael?
michael_scott Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
carol_stills Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
michael_scott Oh, these... all your kids?
carol_stills No just the front two.
michael_scott Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
carol_stills Sure.
michael_scott Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
michael_scott Push. Good! That's great. You got it. Excuse me.
kevin_malone Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. It was negative.
michael_scott Oh... God... God! We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here .
michael_scott Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
kevin_malone This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
michael_scott Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
dwight_schrute Turn it around. Turn it around.
michael_scott Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
dwight_schrute Number one!!
michael_scott Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
pam_beesly Michael?
michael_scott Yeah.
pam_beesly This is from all of us.
michael_scott Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
pam_beesly Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
