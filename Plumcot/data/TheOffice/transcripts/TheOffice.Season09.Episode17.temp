dwight Hold it!
creed New glasses.
erin Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
dwight I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt shirley has died.
pam Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
dwight I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
dwight My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
jim My condolences.
dwight Keep them.
jim OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
dwight In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
erin What color is it?
phyllis It looks pretty black.
kevin Yep. Acidic, all right.
oscar Oh, thank god.
dwight Excuse me?
oscar I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just. have a personal training session.
dwight OK. That's not.
oscar I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight. 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
jim I'm sure. I'm sure she's in a better place.
dwight I really hope so.
jim OK. This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
dwight I miss her so much.
jim OK.
dwight You know?
mose Zeke's here.
dwight Zeke.
zeke Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'.
mose 'Hi' to Mom.
dwight Are you going?
mose Will there be ghosts there?
dwight Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
zeke You get in the sidecar.
dwight Get.
dwight What are you doing here?
oscar You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
dwight Oh, yeah.
oscar Who is that?
dwight Jeb, my brother.
oscar You have a brother?
dwight Uh-huh.
jeb I didn't really see a better parking spot. Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental. You wanna go in?
erin Oh, gosh. Todd
packer Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
clark Who's this guy?
pam . bad. Todd
packer Hi, all.
phyllis Why are you here, Todd? Todd
packer OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
kevin Packer, we accept. Todd
packer Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff. OK. Uh, where to begin. Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, this kid in a few years.
pam Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology. Todd
packer Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
pam I think it's called 'Nibbles'. Todd
packer Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? There you go.
pam Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake. German
minister We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil.
jeb Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.
dwight Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
jeb Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all.
dwight Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
jeb It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.
dwight Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
jeb Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any. German
minister Would the family care to say something?
dwight You had black hair and then gray hair.
zeke You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4", at the end you were 5'1".
oscar They're a descriptive people.
fannie I see you started without me.
dwight You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
fannie Well, I told you.
jeb Hi, Fannie.
fannie Hey.
oscar Who is that?
zeke Dwight's sister.
oscar dwight has a sister?
zeke Yeah.
oscar She's beautiful.
zeke Blugh.
dwight Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. What is this? Oh, god. Henry.
henry Dwight.
dwight I see Esther's back in town.
esther Hi Dwight.
dwight Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
esther This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.
dwight Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
fannie We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here.
dwight OK.
henry Anyone mention her height?
zeke Yep.
henry Land size? Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. OK.
dwight So, let's get it going. German
minister Would you want to do the honors?
fannie Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this.
dwight We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
oscar That's it for me.
pam I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
phyllis I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
pam We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2. 50? Is that the price of our dignity?
creed $3. 75 a cupcake, actually. $3. 67 if you buy a dozen.
creed I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
clark Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark. Todd
packer Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
clark You didn't actually say that. Todd
packer No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. Hey. I have a crazy feeling that you are really gonna like this.
stanley Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. And you did fire him.
nellie I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
pam Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
angela Do they even have a bakery anymore?
kevin They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
pam So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
andy Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
phyllis So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
meredith OK.
phyllis OK. packer can go to hell. . push; Aunt
shirley Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.
dwight Thank you. Aunt
shirley Jeb. A street pusher.
jeb After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out "worm" means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of. pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management.
dwight I can't stand the fact that jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich. Aunt
shirley We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So, here are my terms. Dwight, Fannie, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So, there, you have it.
fannie Is she crazy? Dwight?
jeb Buddy? Buddy?
fannie No, no, no.
jeb Snap out of it. Dwight?
dwight Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
fannie No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy?
dwight Of course you are.
fannie Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain. sort of sophistication.
dwight Oh my god.
fannie That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don't know. The men are just. it's almost like there's a. a willing ignorance.
fannie Yes. I, thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And, I was recently published. Which is just. maybe I have. Yep. I do. Here it is from the um, Hartford Women's Lit Quarterly. com. A Willing Ignorance by fannie Schrute.
jeb Totally. Yep. The people here are like Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart?
dwight You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
jeb Couple of nights couldn't hurt.
fannie Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt.
dwight You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
zeke Absolutely.
zeke Growing up with dwight and mose was not easy. Uh, dwight was obviously the cool one. And, mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian.
fannie That doesn't work on me.
dwight OK.
fannie By the way, that's not.
dwight 
fannie Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui.
dwight Oui.
fannie Oh my goodness.
dwight People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
fannie So, I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then, if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks. Todd
packer Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you.
meredith I'm not sorry about it. Todd
packer I am. It was my rock bottom.
angela Kevin, you can do this.
kevin You don't know that.
pam Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
angela Uh-huh.
kevin James Bond was a spy.
pam Yes. He was a good spy.
kevin Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake. Todd
packer Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care. Todd
packer I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.
pam Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. Hey!
angela What, Pam?
pam Wait!
angela He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
pam No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
andy Oh my god. I forgive him so much. Whoa, is he choking?
angela Kevin?
kevin Oh, that was fantastic.
cameron Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?
dwight Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
cameron I was just asking you something I didn't know.
dwight Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
cameron Are we gonna eat these today?
dwight If you want.
cameron Is that a guillotine?
dwight This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
cameron That's a cow?
dwight Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
cameron What are you doing now?
dwight Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
cameron I don't know.
dwight Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
cameron I don't know any of that.
dwight OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
cameron I never met him.
pam Good morning, Erin.
erin Hey.
pam Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd packer doesn't know, it's OK.
phyllis I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
pam Phyllis!
clark packer laced the cupcakes.
pam No!
meredith Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
angela Some of us got both.
pam Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
phyllis Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
nellie Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
stanley Me too.
clark I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
phyllis What did you do, Andy?
andy Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. Na, nothing really. Kevin?
kevin Why would you ask me?
andy I'm not, a. I'm just. I don't know. Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. Pretty normal night.
kevin My night was just like that. Meaning normal.
andy Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all.
kevin Nope. I did not see you either.
pam Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
kevin Ah.
pam But, kevin that's.
kevin Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
angela No. Todd
packer So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends.
darryl That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
jim Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too. Todd
packer It's OK. I'm over it.
jeb Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it.
fannie Not it.
dwight It. That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
fannie All right.
