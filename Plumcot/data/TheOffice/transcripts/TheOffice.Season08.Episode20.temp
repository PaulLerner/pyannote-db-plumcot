pam Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
jim Oh, great. "Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy. " Oh that's not good.
phyllis Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
pam It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
jim stanley doesn't have a moustache.
pam Yeah he does.
oscar Pam, hit the brakes. stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
pam Okay, phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
phyllis Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
pam Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
jim Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
angela 'Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
pam Okay, which one of these looks more right?
dwight Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
gabe Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
jim Okay, quick. Who says moustache?
dwight Yep.
jim Who says no moustache?
gabe Ah! Ha ha ha!
phyllis He does have a moustache.
dwight Yes!
pam Welcome back, Stanley.
robert "Good morning, Robert, " says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. Pam!
pam Oh!
robert Is this a video conference you're having with "Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz"?
pam Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
robert People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a. m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
nellie Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
robert Nellie, really, nine fifty?
nellie Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
robert Ah.
nellie Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
robert I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
nellie Ah ha!
robert I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
nellie Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
robert No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.
nellie Well, yes, uh. there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here? kevin &amp;
meredith Yes.
nellie Ugh! I hate that! No offense.
kevin None taken.
oscar Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
nellie oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
stanley Who's a native?
nellie Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court.
oscar What does that mean?
dwight Okay, okay.
nellie If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
robert Nellie?
nellie Yes, Robert!
robert You're clearly under a lot of. stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
nellie Yeah.
robert Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help nellie move those boxes into her new place.
dwight Why Jim?
robert The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
pam I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
jim I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
pam I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
jim Why is she here?
andy Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
erin Going to Pennsylvania.
andy On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
erin Oh. That must be nice.
andy Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
erin Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
andy Oh. Hmm.
andy Time to have a little kiss!
erin No.
andy Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
erin Yes.
andy I believe in that.
erin Yes. So do I.
andy I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
erin Important.
andy Mm-hmm.
phyllis I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
pam I know, right?
oscar She's always late, she's always rude.
phyllis It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
oscar Yeah.
phyllis On purpose.
pam Phyllis!
angela We should do it right here in the break room.
phyllis Order carrot cake.
andy . and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for erin than anything wrong with you.
erin Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
andy Consider it nailed.
erin I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
andy Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
erin What?
andy I just need you to know-
erin What is it? I didn't sleep well last night.
dwight Ugh! Ow.
jim Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
dwight Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is. "
jim That was one time-
dwight I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
nellie Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
jim Excuse me, one second. Hi.
pam Hey, what's up?
jim Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
dwight Haulin' cube!
jim That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
pam So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
jim Sounds like every other party.
pam No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
jim Oh! Hire a magician.
pam What?
jim Trust me.
pam Okay.
andy Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
lauren Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?
andy Hey, Lauren. Look at you.
lauren Well, I know. Look at me.
andy I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
lauren Aww!
andy Why is erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
lauren Oh. God.
erin So, I'm Erin. Hi.
andy Yep. This is Erin.
lauren Nice to meet you. Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here!
erin Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
andy Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
lauren Oh, Jess! Look who stopped by after his business trip!
jessica Andy! Hey!
dwight I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
jim Yes, you should.
dwight Ooh.
jim "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie. "
dwight I have to see these shoes.
jim I doubt that they're sh-
dwight Oh!
jim Whoa. Who is this guy?
dwight Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
jim Boyfriend.
dwight Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
jim Like a boyfriend?
dwight You read my mind.
jim Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
dwight Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
jim Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
nellie Oh.
jim Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just.
nellie I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
dwight Why not call.
jim Shh!
nellie God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
dwight That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
jim Dwight!
nellie I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
jim I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
dwight If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
nellie Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
jim No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or.
nellie God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician? . push;
jim You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
pam What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
jim No, that's not what I-
nellie Jim, could you give us a hand?
jim Absolutely. Yeah. Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
pam Oh, okay. Okay, I will.
angela Pam, we have a great idea.
oscar Listen to this.
angela We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
pam Or what if.
angela Okay.
pam We discuss. the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. Not mean.
angela I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
oscar We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
pam What are you talking about? Yes we can.
oscar What I mean to say is we don't want to.
phyllis Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
lauren Suck it!
erin Andy-
andy It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy pen1s?
erin No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
andy These are delicious.
erin But. they're penises.
lauren And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together.
andy Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. I don't know. I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one. Party
guests No, pop it. Pop it!
jessica Hey.
andy Hey.
jessica Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
megan Ahh!
andy Oh! Ah, Megan.
megan You are one of the good ones, nard dog.
andy Aww.
megan No, really. Where's my Andy?
jessica I dunno.
andy Oh, he's out there.
megan Aww. Are you going to sing for us?
andy Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so.
megan That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!
andy By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes.
pam Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle?
darryl Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. ryan was douche bag.
ryan Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
oscar Plus everyone would know who you meant.
ryan Yeah!
pam No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
angela Nobody's named Monday.
ryan Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
pam 'Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
kevin Shh, here she comes!
all Hey!
phyllis Welcome to your party.
creed Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long.
creed Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, "Have you heard my originals? They're terrible. " They said, "Even better. " I said, "I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie. "
erin Maybe we should just go.
andy No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
jessica Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
andy Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
jessica Uh, yeah. What is it?
andy Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
jessica You're breaking up with me?
andy Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
jessica Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
andy Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
jessica What?
andy I am gay, and I prefer men.
kenny I knew it!
andy You did not, Kenny!
kenny You invited me to go shopping with you.
andy I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
jessica Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were. together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
andy Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
jessica I can't say it doesn't make sense.
andy Well. I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
jessica Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just. I'm just upset for now.
andy Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. So. we should probably. go.
robert This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
oscar To nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
robert Cheers.
nellie Why thank you.
oscar Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
all Cheers.
angela nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if pam died.
jim Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows pam only a little bit. enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
creed We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
all We hate Pam! We hate Pam!
magician So we've established-
jim No. No.
magician -that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just. disappear?
pam Oh!
erin That was a really rough scene.
andy Right? Rough scene.
erin Yeah.
andy Oh. at least we can kiss now.
erin Oh, yeah.
andy You know, that stuff that I said about you to her. I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
erin Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah. I feel really tired.
andy Yeah.
erin Probably from seeing that turkey.
andy Oh yeah.
erin When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
magician Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?
jim Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
robert no, Nellie, she-
jim I'll do it.
magician Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for. birds. all right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is. I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is.
jim It's the four of hearts.
robert Oh, no, you-
magician Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. all right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?
robert Why is jim treating the magician poorly?
magician Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory.
jim Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
magician But I never could seem to figure out those knots.
pam That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
magician What the hell? all right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-
dwight Okay scram, wizard.
magician What?
dwight You heard me!
magician Huh!
robert Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known jim and pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
nellie Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
robert Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.
kevin You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
erin What? Why are we-
andy I just gotta do one thing.
megan Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who's here.
jessica What are you doing here?
andy Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
megan Why the hell did you come back here?
jessica Go away.
kenny Get lost!
woman Get out!
andy Okay.
lauren You're done!
andy Bye guys.
lauren Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? Yeah, run away!
kenny You're disgusting!
lauren I can't believe you're not gay!
kenny Yeah get out of here.
various Don't come back.
erin Uh-oh!
various You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!
pam Hey Hank.
hank Yes ma'am.
pam I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
hank Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open.
jim Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
hank What? That ain't right.
pam Yeah, he came and went.
hank Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? You don't think he could've used. it couldn't have been.
pam Let's just- let's go.
jim Night-night.
