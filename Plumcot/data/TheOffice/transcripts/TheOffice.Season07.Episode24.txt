creed_bratton It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. Keep it running.
creed_bratton Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
creed_bratton Find out what language this is.
creed_bratton Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
jim_halpert He never called a meeting.
creed_bratton BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first "B" stand for?
pam_beesly What are we doing?
creed_bratton We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first "B" stand for?
kevin_malone Um... Business!
creed_bratton I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! All right! The "O"...
pam_beesly We need a new manager.
jim_halpert Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
fred_henry Henry Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
jim_halpert Really?
fred_henry Yeah.
jim_halpert ...What is it?
fred_henry Nice try.
toby_flenderson I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?
fred_henry Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan.
gabe_lewis Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
fred_henry Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?
gabe_lewis How would we know that, if you don't...
jim_halpert You could just be saying it to get the job.
fred_henry I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?
jim_halpert How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
fred_henry Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
jim_halpert Okay.
fred_henry Color-code sent documents, TM.
jim_halpert Did you just trademark that...
toby_flenderson W-What?
fred_henry That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.
jim_halpert We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
stanley_hudson Good morning.
darryl_philbin Good morning.
phyllis_vance Good morning.
darryl_philbin Good morning.
phyllis_vance Did you have a nice drive in?
darryl_philbin I did.
darryl_philbin I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... bla-aaack!
andy_bernard
erin_hannon It's good. I really hope you get it!
andy_bernard The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
erin_hannon Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
andy_bernard Don't even... EEEHHHH!!!!
erin_hannon You in the boss's chair!
andy_bernard EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
andy_bernard In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
erin_hannon Did you hear anything?
phyllis_vance Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results.
phyllis_vance It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
erin_hannon So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
phyllis_vance But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
erin_hannon Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
phyllis_vance Mm.
erin_hannon But why not find out.
phyllis_vance Yeah.
pam_beesly Should you really be so blatant about that?
dwight_schrute They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
pam_beesly Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
dwight_schrute Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Warren#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode24 Buffett Can you do any better on salary?
jim_halpert Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Warren#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode24 What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.
jim_halpert Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Warren#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode24 How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?
angela_martin Okay. How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
kevin_malone The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
toby_flenderson How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
robert_california California You don't work in sales, do you.
toby_flenderson Uh... Human Resources.
robert_california You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... s*x. Everything... is s*x. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.
toby_flenderson Yes.
gabe_lewis Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. Do you, um, do you think that you are?
robert_california Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
gabe_lewis No.
jim_halpert Can you... You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
robert_california Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
jim_halpert Yes.
robert_california That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
jim_halpert Yes.
robert_california Yes. You do.
jim_halpert He creeps me out. But, I think he might be a genius.
andy_bernard Good luck, Darryl.
darryl_philbin Thank you.
darryl_philbin Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
jim_halpert Oh.
darryl_philbin So this is cool. I think we make a good fit.
gabe_lewis Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
darryl_philbin Uh... yes?! I was. Little joke!
toby_flenderson So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
darryl_philbin I thought that was your job.
toby_flenderson Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
jim_halpert Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
darryl_philbin I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions.
darryl_philbin Who's that?
jim_halpert So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
darryl_philbin I... I just thought you knew me.
jim_halpert Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. Cool?
darryl_philbin Let me... Oh. Cool.
merv_bronte Bronte Did, uh, you just interview?
robert_california Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
merv_bronte What do you mean?
robert_california That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.
merv_bronte Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job.
merv_bronte Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here.
dwight_schrute What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? What are you doing..? Stop trying to figure me out.
robert_california I just did.
dwight_schrute You can't.
robert_california It's done.
dwight_schrute No, it's not.
robert_california I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing. You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]
dwight_schrute Stop trying to figure me out. Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
robert_california I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street.
dwight_schrute Get out.
dwight_schrute I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
merv_bronte You guys pay for relocation, though, right?
toby_flenderson Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
merv_bronte Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
jim_halpert Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
merv_bronte I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there.
jim_halpert Is this a bad time to be doing this?
merv_bronte I'm having a bad time.
toby_flenderson I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
merv_bronte Wait.
merv_bronte Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.
angela_martin Thank you.
pam_beesly It's gorgeous, Angela.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
meredith_palmer Wow...
angela_martin It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
meredith_palmer Tell us the freaking story!
kevin_malone Yeah! Tell us a story.
angela_martin Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
pam_beesly Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
angela_martin Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me?
pam_beesly That's not accurate.
angela_martin Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide.
oscar_martinez Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, I'm a little excited. But overall, horrified.
jim_halpert Andy? You all set?
andy_bernard Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
phyllis_vance Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
andy_bernard Augh.
erin_hannon I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
jim_halpert So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
andy_bernard For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here...
gabe_lewis Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
andy_bernard I wasn't acc-, accusing...
gabe_lewis Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
andy_bernard Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
toby_flenderson I didn't think you were.
gabe_lewis I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
gabe_lewis How many windows are there in New York City?
andy_bernard What?
gabe_lewis Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
andy_bernard Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
gabe_lewis No... How far away is the Sun?
andy_bernard Uh, 93 million miles.
jim_halpert Is it?
andy_bernard Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
gabe_lewis Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN!
andy_bernard I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
darryl_philbin Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say "Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... Clippy.
creed_bratton First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. Saving face. Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
pam_beesly How is this on me?
pam_beesly Hang up. Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. Intel has told us there were at least seven.
creed_bratton Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
pam_beesly They're the same picture.
kelly_kapoor Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
jim_halpert Your department's just you, right?
kelly_kapoor Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
gabe_lewis Great! Um, can we just...
kelly_kapoor What was that?
gabe_lewis We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so...
kelly_kapoor Am I not a serious candidate?
gabe_lewis What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. Um, what are your weaknesses?
kelly_kapoor I don't have any, assh***.
dwight_schrute I want an interview.
dwight_schrute How's the family?
jim_halpert Good!
dwight_schrute Good. They good?
jim_halpert Yeah.
dwight_schrute What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
jim_halpert Peepa.
dwight_schrute Peepa, how is she?
jim_halpert Great.
dwight_schrute Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute Now, listen,...
jim_halpert You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
dwight_schrute Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
jim_halpert Okay. That's vivid.
dwight_schrute I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited s*x breaks for you and Pam...
jim_halpert Yikes.
dwight_schrute Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
jim_halpert Well, you know how I like taking bribes.
dwight_schrute Ha ha!
jim_halpert Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
dwight_schrute Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute Let me get that for you.
jim_halpert Thank you.
dwight_schrute Okay.
oscar_martinez Pam... I think Robert is gay.
pam_beesly The Senator? He was married before, and he has a kid.
oscar_martinez So!?
pam_beesly And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
oscar_martinez I have a very strong suspicion.
pam_beesly Did you see him at a bathhouse?
oscar_martinez What bathhouse?
pam_beesly The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
oscar_martinez What?
pam_beesly Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
oscar_martinez My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
pam_beesly You're in the gay mafia.
oscar_martinez You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. You sound ignorant.
ryan_howard You guys, um, talking Senator?
pam_beesly No.
oscar_martinez No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
ryan_howard 'Cause he's totally gay?
ryan_howard Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He "liked" my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
david_brent Brent Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. When do I start? Yeah.
phyllis_vance Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
erin_hannon I... I don't think I can do that.
phyllis_vance Bestiality. Yeah.
erin_hannon Well, that's not my personality.
phyllis_vance If my daughter were asking me...
erin_hannon Yes?
phyllis_vance I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
erin_hannon I do really want him.
darryl_philbin So, uh... here you go.
jim_halpert Great.
darryl_philbin Hope it's all right.
jim_halpert I'm sure it's fine.
darryl_philbin The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
jim_halpert Howard Cline?
darryl_philbin Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
jim_halpert Oh... Deshaun Williams.
darryl_philbin Yes. How did he do?
jim_halpert He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
darryl_philbin Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
jim_halpert Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.
nellie_bertram Bertram First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.
toby_flenderson But there aren't...
nellie_bertram Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
gabe_lewis A little un-specific.
nellie_bertram Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
jim_halpert That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
nellie_bertram Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. At least once a month, the lowest performing person... bye bye!
gabe_lewis How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
nellie_bertram Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
gabe_lewis Okay.
nellie_bertram By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
jim_halpert I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
nellie_bertram Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
jim_halpert That's very...
nellie_bertram You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
gabe_lewis Okay, that's not gonna be...
nellie_bertram Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go.
oscar_martinez Is there a front runner?
jim_halpert You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
oscar_martinez Well, there must be someone who stands out.
jim_halpert No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
oscar_martinez Well...
stanley_hudson The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
ryan_howard Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
stanley_hudson My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously.
jim_halpert Uh--
meredith_palmer You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life.
jim_halpert Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
oscar_martinez Are you?
ryan_howard Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James.
jo_bennett Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this.
gabe_lewis All right.
jo_bennett Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
jim_halpert No, was it good?
jo_bennett Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?
darryl_philbin Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
jo_bennett Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?
darryl_philbin Paper material, ma'am.
jo_bennett Paper material?
darryl_philbin Pieces of paper.
dwight_schrute Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
jo_bennett Or what? You gonna shoot me?
dwight_schrute Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
jo_bennett I'll interview you right now.
dwight_schrute Okay.
jo_bennett Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
dwight_schrute It's complicated.
jo_bennett Yeah, but see... it's not.
phyllis_vance I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
pam_beesly I'm a woman. I would want to know.
meredith_palmer Yeah, you gotta know.
kevin_malone Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
oscar_martinez You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
phyllis_vance You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
pam_beesly She does seem happy.
oscar_martinez You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
kevin_malone We don't tell her.
pam_beesly Okay.
kelly_kapoor Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
jo_bennett Okay.
kelly_kapoor Uh,... can it be in private? Don't worry, it's not about you. As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
jo_bennett Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!
creed_bratton Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant.
jordan_garfield Who is our biggest client?
pam_beesly Uh, just put him through to me.
jordan_garfield Okay.
pam_beesly Hello! This is... the client.
creed_bratton It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
pam_beesly Yes.
creed_bratton Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
pam_beesly Great.
creed_bratton All right, thank you, bye-bye.
pam_beesly Thank you, bye-bye.
erin_hannon Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
jo_bennett Huh?
erin_hannon He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
jo_bennett No, send him in. Who is this?
gabe_lewis I have no idea.
jim_halpert Oh, I know this guy. Hello! Mr. "Soo-ven-yay." Mr. "Jacques Soo-ven-yay." Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
dwight_schrute Assistant Regional Manager.
jim_halpert Assistant to the Regional Manager.
dwight_schrute Assistant Regional Manager.
jim_halpert What is it?
dwight_schrute Assistant Regional Manager.
jim_halpert Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
jo_bennett I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. If he isn't here in sixty seconds...
dwight_schrute Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... It's me. I'm Dwight.
jim_halpert No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the...
dwight_schrute Yeah.
jim_halpert Ohhhh!
gabe_lewis Very unprofessional, "Jacques." Or, should I say, Dwight.
jo_bennett Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
dwight_schrute I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
jo_bennett All that for this job.
dwight_schrute Yes.
jo_bennett That's f***ing crazy. Get outta here. What a nutjob.
jim_halpert This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, "just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear."
jo_bennett Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?
jim_halpert Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
jo_bennett Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?
gabe_lewis How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability.
jo_bennett And that's your unbiased opinion.
gabe_lewis Yes, it is.
jo_bennett So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
gabe_lewis Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
jo_bennett Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
gabe_lewis That sounds like a promotion!
jo_bennett It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
jim_halpert Um... why Kelly?
jo_bennett 'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
jim_halpert Okay.
jo_bennett How'd my girl Nellie do?
jim_halpert Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
jo_bennett She didn't mention it?
jim_halpert No.
jo_bennett Integrity move. I like it.
jim_halpert You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
jo_bennett Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
erin_hannon Ahh!
oscar_martinez Erin, what are you doing?
erin_hannon I've been turned into a puppet!
oscar_martinez Okay.
kevin_malone Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
erin_hannon I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
kevin_malone Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
erin_hannon And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
kevin_malone It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
erin_hannon I need the most special thing in the office.
dwight_schrute Silence?
erin_hannon A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard!
andy_bernard Hey, Erin.
erin_hannon Oh.
andy_bernard Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
erin_hannon I've done it all my life.
andy_bernard Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
andy_bernard Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
angela_martin Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
stanley_hudson I'll get over it.
angela_martin I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
pam_beesly That was our dream wedding.
angela_martin Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
pam_beesly I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
angela_martin Hmm.
jim_halpert All right. Name.
dwight_schrute Dwight Schrute.
jim_halpert Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. We will let you know.
dwight_schrute You have to interview me...
jim_halpert I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
dwight_schrute I demand more questions!
jim_halpert All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
dwight_schrute Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
jim_halpert Yes.
dwight_schrute What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That's a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
jim_halpert Thank you, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Thank you. You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting.
jim_halpert Well, that was quick.
kelly_kapoor Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
jim_halpert He's not a real candidate.
kelly_kapoor I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
jim_halpert You took the deal.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, it was a great deal.
jim_halpert That's not okay.
kelly_kapoor I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
toby_flenderson Well, we could try him out for a little while... and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
jim_halpert What is happening right now?
phyllis_vance Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
jim_halpert No, why would you think that?
phyllis_vance He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
jim_halpert Okay. Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
kelly_kapoor That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
jim_halpert No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
dwight_schrute Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
jim_halpert Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
andy_bernard Tuna... You're completely sane.
jim_halpert Thank you.
andy_bernard Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
jim_halpert Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
kevin_malone Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
jim_halpert I suppose I am.
kevin_malone Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. what do 'I' want?...
oscar_martinez I don't think he meant, that--
kevin_malone So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
oscar_martinez Go ahead.
kevin_malone What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... Everyone is listening to me.
oscar_martinez Can I say...?
jim_halpert Yes.
oscar_martinez I think it should be Darryl.
jim_halpert Okay.
dwight_schrute What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
oscar_martinez Kelly's on your side.
kelly_kapoor I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
andy_bernard Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
ryan_howard I want an outsider.
jim_halpert Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
ryan_howard No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
pam_beesly A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
ryan_howard No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
pam_beesly No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
ryan_howard Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
ryan_howard I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
meredith_palmer I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
jim_halpert Hey! Hey! Hey!
meredith_palmer Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny pen1s. Are you happy? Let's hire that guy!
andy_bernard She may have a point there... would a small pen1s work? Small-to-moderate.
gabe_lewis Gotta catch a plane.
pam_beesly Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
gabe_lewis Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
kelly_kapoor You are not leaving without giving me a hug. Ughh.
gabe_lewis Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
kelly_kapoor I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
gabe_lewis There are plenty of people who love touching me. I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
kevin_malone Later, man.
all@ Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.
ryan_howard Take care, man.
dwight_schrute We're gonna miss you, Gabe.
andy_bernard Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
erin_hannon I see it. I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of and facing, and I'm like...
phyllis_vance Yeah. Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point.
phyllis_vance No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day.
jim_halpert What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
angela_martin Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
toby_flenderson No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk.
kevin_malone Exactly.
darryl_philbin Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
jada Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?
darryl_philbin Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
jada I don't know if he'd be a good manager , but he's a really great dad!
darryl_philbin Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go.
phyllis_vance It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
jim_halpert What? No, no, it's not a vote.
phyllis_vance Then what was this all about?
jim_halpert I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
kelly_kapoor I don't care. They can just vote.
jim_halpert No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? What the hell happened out there?
andy_bernard Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
nellie_bertram This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
darryl_philbin Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
fred_henry No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of... Vance Refrigeration.
merv_bronte Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today.
robert_california I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.
the_fingerlakes_guy Lakes Guy I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.
dwight_schrute I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... I don't know. Something always works out.
creed_bratton You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
pam_beesly Is that right?
creed_bratton I think you two should meet.
pam_beesly Well, okay!
creed_bratton Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together.
pam_beesly as "fourth-biggest client" Hello!
pam_beesly as "ninth-biggest client" Hello!
pam_beesly as "fourth-biggest client" Hi, how are ya?
pam_beesly as "ninth-biggest client" Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!
pam_beesly as "fourth-biggest client" Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!
creed_bratton It's Kismet!
