stanley What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
erin Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon! Come on Stanley!
erin dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a. "Mageddon!"
erin Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
stanley I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they're making me climb Stair Mountain!
erin Come on!
oscar Our office has an unusually large number of. unusually large people.
stanley This is an abomination.
erin Come on. You got this. Here.
oscar So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
andy Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
oscar What?
andy I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune. com. There's a review of the documentary!
phyllis What does it say?
andy I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, "Red Alert. "
dwight Well, the alert was already set to "Red" because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to "Double Red"?
andy I think we should.
stanley 
oscar "The
office An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton's own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!"
everyone Whoo!
nellie "In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There's kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get. "
dwight What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news. thing.
nellie "andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy. "
phyllis Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that's-.
andy It's okay. The hell does he know?
nellie "A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent. "
andy I want you to print that out for me.
nellie I will.
andy Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb.
erin "Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values. "
nellie Oh! Which public figure?
erin I bet it's Katie Couric. I've been saying this for years.
phyllis No, I think they mean more like a politician.
stanley You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
dwight Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
stanley Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
dwight The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order.
stanley You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
pete Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
pam Well, we won't be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
nellie Oh, your mom's watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? Oh, um, Embassy Suites. "Do Not Disturb" sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
pam I wish.
nellie What, then?
pam Oh, nothing that exciting.
nellie Marriage counseling?
pam Hmm.
nellie Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
pam You know, Jim's kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
nellie Mmm.
pam I mean, we've having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right?
jim Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
toby Oh, sure.
jim It's a little, uh, personal.
toby Let's do it. Let's get personal.
jim I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
toby Whoa.
jim Sorry. I—no, no, no, what I meant—what I meant actually was—
toby Oh, yeah, no, it's okay. I can handle it. Um, so.
jim You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
toby 
jim Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple's counseling.
toby Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and pam aren't in couple's counseling, are you? Oh, God.
jim No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couple's counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better.
toby Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s—hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
clark My mistake.
toby Yes, it is your mistake. He's lingering. So annoying. I'm gonna kill him. How can I help? I'm here.
jim That's all right.
andy Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye.
angela Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
robert Don't worry. I've scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.
angela All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that.
dwight Andy— I need to talk to you.
andy Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up!
dwight stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
andy I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? stanley has to go. That's final.
dwight So what I'm hearing you say is, "Make stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible"?
andy Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent.
dwight Mm-hmm. Good luck.
andy Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
dwight For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts.
clark Hey, Dwight.
dwight Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
stanley Pass.
clark Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
dwight Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
stanley Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha—
dwight 
clark Holy .
stanley No, you didn't. Sick of you and your—ooh—
dwight 
stanley 
dwight It's all right. andy approved it.
meredith Man, he's really in twinkle town now.
clark Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
dwight Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do.
clark You gave him three shots.
dwight Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. Grab his feet. Let's go!
clark All right.
dwight Move it! One, two, three.
dwight He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! Oh, God. No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
clark We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
dwight Yes.
dwight Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push!
clark I am!
clark Any good weekend plans?
dwight I might see a movie.
clark Nice.
dwight What about you?
clark Uh, I don't know yet.
dwight Let's take him—
clark I was thinking about.
dwight Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
clark And then what?
dwight Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before.
clark Well, if I may, you're a natural.
dwight Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1, 000 times, but, uh.
clark That's a little weird.
dwight I know. Evel Knievel.
dwight 
clark That's about as good as that's gonna be.
dwight Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
clark Catch?
dwight Yeah.
clark I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds.
dwight You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's only—
clark Blunt?
dwight It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicine—
clark Dude, this size of my haunches—
dwight Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
clark We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
dwight You okay?
jim So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or.
toby You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
jim Mm-hmm.
toby He might start by asking each of you, "Why do you think you're here?" . push;
pam He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he shouldn't be rewarded for that.
jim If I didn't do certain things without telling Pam, she'd be married to Roy.
pam I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up.
jim If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I—this will be so huge for our family.
toby Well, what's a little while?
jim What do you mean?
toby I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end.
jim That's kind of an impossible question.
erin Oh, guys, it's starting! Hurry!
kevin Ooh, there's Angela! I work with her!
andy Huh, yeah. I mean, I'm happy Angela's the first one getting famous, but it's a little weird, no? I mean, she can't sing or act, so it's actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
phyllis Her hair looks beautiful.
andy Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin' movie star!
erin Andy!
robert I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest. I am gay.
crowd Reporter #1
 Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay? Reporter #2
 Question for the Senator's beard.
robert I'll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
pete Poor Angela.
phyllis Yeah. Poor Angela.
robert I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn't until my marriage to angela that I realized how. charmless I find the female body.
meredith Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
robert There's someone else I need to thank. His name is oscar Martinez.
andy Come on!
robert oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time—
erin oscar is with the Senator too?
kevin Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew!
oscar He knew!
kevin Yes, we did it!
oscar You did it, Kevin.
kevin Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
robert --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing. Chief of Staff Wesley Silver.
oscar What?!
creed Wesley Silver's gay?
crowd 
angela 
kevin Ohh.
creed They make a nice couple.
angela 
dwight Almost there. Almost there. Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside.
clark We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
dwight Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
clark That's actually really smart.
dwight Thank you.
clark God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
dwight Let's get him inside.
andy carla Fern is not just an actor's agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
andy Actor?
man Oh, no. Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.
andy Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
man Eh, you go through a lot of mice.
man If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.
andy Does anything go on top of the mouse?
man Yeah. Little hat.
andy Aw, that's cute.
man Yeah.
andy What's the mouse's name?
man Eh, you know, it really doesn't make sense to name the mice. They're kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You're not one of those PETA guys , are you? Oh, great.
clark Hey, wait, wait, how—how are we doing this?
dwight Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
clark Just say "arms" and "legs, " okay? That just—that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with.
dwight Fine, let's go.
clark 
dwight Hoist his shank on three.
clark Wha—What's a shank?
dwight It's by the tenderloin.
dwight Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can you—sl-slouch him into the seat. Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt.
clark All right.
dwight Got it?
clark Yeah—yup yup.
dwight Get in the back.
clark What?
dwight Get in the back.
clark Aw, come on.
dwight Get in.
clark Damn it.
dwight Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do?
stanley Helllloooo!
clark Okay. We, hey—hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
stanley Pigeons.
dwight Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be stanley Hudson.
clark Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister?
dwight New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go.
pam I'm sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
jim Well, if pam says she won't go, then— we're gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
nellie That was exhausting.
toby Blah blah blah blah. Jim.
nellie Well, they deserve each other, then.
toby They do. That they do.
nellie That is for sure.
toby That they do.
dwight And for—oh, whoopsie daisy. Mrs.
davis Stanley, what is going on here?
dwight He's fine. He gets carsick really easily.
clark Driving.
dwight It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
stanley Ooh-hoo, look at that baby.
dwight Stanley.
stanley Ohhh. Mrs.
davis That's Benji in the middle.
stanley That's Benji. Oh, he's precious. That's a healthy-looking baby. Mrs.
davis Very special little boy.
dwight Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child. Mrs.
davis Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, "eee. "
dwight Like this? Watch.
stanley Eee.
everyone Mrs.
davis Like that.
stanley A beautiful family.
dwight Right? Come on!
dwight Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
carla So, what can you do?
andy Well, what can't I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn't noticed, I've got a pretty good British accent.
carla Can you drive a car?
andy At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
carla Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45?
andy My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal's going out on.
carla Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap?
andy
 Yes. And yes.
carla Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid's party, let ‘em throw pies at ya?
andy Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. I'm all for it.
carla Well, Mr. Bernard, I'm gonna be honest with you.
andy Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
carla Uh, no. We're—we're gonna take you on as a client.
andy You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
carla We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay todd on your way out.
andy Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with carla you pay a flat rate of $5, 000 up front. And that includes headshots.
todd Uh, it doesn't include headshots.
andy It doesn't include headshots.
todd No.
andy Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
stanley So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
dwight You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell andy the good news. Oh. Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
stanley Oh, no, I'm not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
dwight Well—no, no—n—
stanley 
dwight We need a winch and a hoist.
