dwight Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR and I, dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
ryan Are you holding this chair?
dwight Yes.
ryan ‘cause I feel like I'm gonna fall off.
dwight Yes. Yes.
ryan I'm not wearing the right shoes for this.
dwight We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
erin Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
erin Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It's me Erin. dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me.
nellie Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than . what's lower than dirt?
dwight Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
nellie Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback.
jim Which Spice Girl?
nellie The black one. I never stood a chance.
jim Okay.
nellie Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
dwight Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much. Todd
packer Yep
dwight Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing – bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love ‘em. ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
ryan When people see this presentation, they're gonna in their pants.
dwight Okay.
jim Come on, man.
cathy Seriously disgusting.
dwight Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
cathy Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
dwight Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid. Todd
packer Uh.
nellie Uh. that is excellent. Todd
packer I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player.
dwight Perfect casting, right? Todd
packer Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
nellie I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E. T, candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
dwight Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!
andy Morning, everyone.
kevin Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
andy Don't care. Tell me later.
kevin Listen, it's important. You've gotta hear this.
andy What do you got?
kelly Oh, my god!
phyllis Do you have a black eye?
andy Yes, I do. Phyllis.
kevin I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
andy What?
kevin It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car.
darryl Andy, who punched you?
meredith Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office?
angela Black eye, Meredith.
kelly Will someone please explain what's going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it's like my life is buffering.
andy Here's what happened. pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam.
pam That's true.
andy They had, uh. weapons.
pam Weapons.
andy I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
pam But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
andy Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
pam Thank goodness he was there.
oscar Good job Andy.
kevin Yeah
andy I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.
dwight Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!
man Quit it.
dwight There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
erin I was ahead of you!
dwight Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids.
erin Come on. I was in line before you.
cathy So you're a blogger right?
blogger Yeah. Blogger.
cathy God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I'm trying to be a good girl for once.
erin Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing. zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
oscar How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
andy No.
angela Yes.
andy No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?
pam Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
andy And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
angela Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
andy Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
pam 1-8-5-0-5.
darryl Guys, guys. That's so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
phyllis Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police.
angela Yes.
andy Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why. toby is giving us self defense training.
toby Me?
andy Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
toby Yeah, um. I can't believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I'll go put on my cup.
andy Great.
nellie Yes!
blogger Okay.
nellie I wasn't really sure which one of you is Chuck.
jim Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
blogger Look at that guy. He's got his Sabre phone on, and he's not even using it. blogger 2
 This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.
jim Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
nellie Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
dwight Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing.
dwight Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
jim I'm very sorry.
nellie We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? "Hello. Hi sweetie. It's Jim. I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape. "
jim I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
dwight You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
dwight Point it towards the store, idiot!
dwight You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
dwight Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
erin We are closed! Come on.
toby Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So. strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it.
creed 
meredith Ow.
toby That may have been my fault.
meredith What the hell, Toby?
toby Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. "It's all about the groin. "
andy What if you're being attacked by a . smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
toby I don't think that's very common.
andy What if you're being attacked by a 4'11" man who is penisless?
oscar Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
andy Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
toby Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
andy So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
toby It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker. You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel. written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
angela Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
toby All right, well, let's try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn't everyone stand? Okay, so. you're being attacked. You've got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
everyone One, two.
andy Take that, kid. . push;
dwight Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine. lady
blogger patty Grossman. I'm a woman.
dwight But you still work for Wired, right?
patty Yes.
dwight Good! Okay. Flirt away.
ryan Sabre. It's time to come home.
jim Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think . it seemed like you were a little nervous.
ryan Yeah, no , Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
dwight Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
ryan You know what?
dwight You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
jim Dwight.
dwight I'm trying to make him feel important.
ryan God. I wish kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
dwight Um. Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
ryan You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
dwight What's a book?
ryan On my God. You're so embarrassing. My mom would say the best stuff, though.
jim You can. You can do it Ryan.
ryan And you know that I'm capable of this.
jim You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
ryan What did you think of the presentation?
jim I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
ryan Oh! "Fix" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
dwight Jim, get him a water.
ryan No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
dwight Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
toby Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you're alive.
lady Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?
andy I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
girl That's him. the guy I hit.
darryl What?
oscar You've gotta be kidding me.
kevin Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
oscar No, kevin --
lady What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?
girl There. That chubby one.
pam I just had a baby.
girl Yesterday?
pam Wow.
lady Apologize.
girl Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your "thin" girlfriend.
pam How ‘bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
lady You know what? Tiffy's going to college.
andy Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
lady God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.
kevin Bye.
kelly So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- "How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls. "
toby There's no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
kelly No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
darryl Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
andy Oh.
dwight Have you seen Erin?
stanley I'm on break.
dwight Oh God. Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
blogger When's the presentation?
dwight It's moments away. Just stay here!
ryan Hey Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife? Well, that doesn't make any sense to me.
nellie How you doing?
ryan Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry. I- I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is.
nellie Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
erin Sorry about kicking you out. It's just, we don't want our brand associated with death. Old
lady It's okay. I'll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.
erin You're not married yet? Old
lady Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away.
erin My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we're not really friends. Old
lady Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!
erin Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband. Old
lady Well.
dwight How long has he been in the bathroom?
jim About ten minutes.
dwight Jeez! What's he doing in there?
jim Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
dwight Are there any bloggers around?
jim It's Ryan. "I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home. "
nellie What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here?
dwight I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing. compared to this guy!
jim Uh.
nellie What?
dwight That's right. Will you just give us a second?
nellie You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good half-assed cock-eyed.
jim okay.
nellie That's. .
dwight jim --
jim I'm not doing the Presentation.
dwight Look at me. Look at me! Look. at. this. face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you. if you don't do this, I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim.
jim Okay, I'll do it.
dwight Oh, my God. O. Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes.
jim A costume?
dwight Of course there's a costume! Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
dwight Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
jim I've been in here for 20 seconds.
dwight Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
jim I'm not wearing eyeliner.
dwight You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
jim Time. Space. Gender. There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. No, that's --
dwight It's true.
jim This. is the future, because. This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain.
dwight Yep.
jim When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. I just wanted. to go home. This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless. will be available in 2013. You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time. and space.
crowd ahhhhhh
dwight Psst.
jim Oh.
ryan Sabre. It's time. to come home.
crowd 
jim All right. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night!
jim Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
toby Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay? We made fun of andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but. little things can be dangerous.
kevin Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
toby Okay. Good point.
angela Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
toby I don't. I don't.
oscar With all due respect we know what we're defending
against a twelve year old female bully.
kelly I was a twelve year old bully.
angela Great! I think kelly should attack Toby.
others Yeah.
kelly Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
angela Thanks.
kelly Good. Let's go.
toby I don't know if this is gonna help. Uh.
angela Let's go Kelly.
toby We should stay to maybe some more traditional models.
kelly You think you're so pretty! Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
toby Okay, this is what's called pre-violent posturing.
kelly Take that! Not so pre-violent anymore!
toby Okay, I'm at what's called "the decision point. "
andy Hey, hey, hey. kelly Kelly, Kelly. come on. . Ow! God! My good eye!
pam Oh boy. Oh no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
andy You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. pam and for Toby. I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, "Where were you when the girls came?"
andy Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. I just feel good!
dwight Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
nellie Dwight. You're the vice president.
dwight Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
nellie 
dwight Okay! Come on!
nellie aagh!
dwight Hah! Yah! Boom!
