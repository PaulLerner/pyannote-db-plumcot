pam_beesly Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
oscar_martinez No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
pam_beesly Oh.
pam_beesly Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
dwight_schrute People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
jim_halpert Oh, yikes.
pam_beesly It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
dwight_schrute It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
pam_beesly The signs will drive people inside.
dwight_schrute The warmth will lure people inside.
andy_bernard Close it.
dwight_schrute This is how business...
andy_bernard Close it.
dwight_schrute I'm not closing the door.
andy_bernard Close it.
dwight_schrute Stop it.
andy_bernard Just close it.
dwight_schrute Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
meredith_palmer Sure.
dwight_schrute Not so fast.
dwight_schrute Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
dwight_schrute I will trade you for the used candle.
meredith_palmer Forget you.
dwight_schrute Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
meredith_palmer Fine, just give it.
dwight_schrute That's how it's done.
kevin_malone Woah, I love her. How much for that?
michael_scott I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
holly_flax 10 dollars.
michael_scott Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
kevin_malone 200.
michael_scott 500.
holly_flax 20.
kevin_malone 45.
michael_scott Get lost.
kevin_malone Damn it.
michael_scott That is how you do it.
holly_flax You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
michael_scott You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
holly_flax Well we could put it in storage... in case.
michael_scott In case... in case of what?
holly_flax You know... in case if something changes.
michael_scott I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
holly_flax Nope.
old_lady How much for the slip and slide?
michael_scott Get lost.
michael_scott Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
kelly_kapoor Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
dwight_schrute Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
kelly_kapoor Screw you man. People like my stuff.
dwight_schrute People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
kelly_kapoor You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
dwight_schrute And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
andy_bernard Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
kevin_malone Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
andy_bernard Really?
kevin_malone Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
darryl_philbin We should play it.
andy_bernard Well... there's no instructions.
darryl_philbin It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
kevin_malone Yea.
andy_bernard I'm pretty good at board games.
darryl_philbin Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
andy_bernard Sure.
dwight_schrute What is this?
jim_halpert How did those get out? I'm sorry.
dwight_schrute Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
jim_halpert I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
dwight_schrute That's a common swindlers trick.
jim_halpert Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
dwight_schrute So you wanna sell me magic beans.
jim_halpert Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
dwight_schrute Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
holly_flax Michael called Dad?
Holly'sMom#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on?
holly_flax Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Holly'sDad#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 Holly?
holly_flax Hi Dad.
Holly'sDad#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 There was a program on TV about India.
holly_flax Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
Holly'sDad#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 Wanna watch it?
holly_flax I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
Holly'sDad#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 What are you doing there?
holly_flax I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Holly'sDad#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 I'll, I'll put your mother on.
holly_flax No. No... no Dad.
Holly'sMom#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 Holly?
holly_flax Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Holly'sMom#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 Don't you worry about him, he's got me.
holly_flax Well who do you have?
Holly'sMom#unknown#TheOffice.Season07.Episode18 I have your father. He's right here I'll put him on.
holly_flax No. Mom?
pam_beesly Oh, which one is decaf?
pam_beesly Michael! Michael!
michael_scott Hi.
pam_beesly Hi.. I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
michael_scott Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
pam_beesly Why do you need more gas?
michael_scott Well, I'm writing a message.
pam_beesly Is it a good message or a bad message?
michael_scott I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
pam_beesly Are you proposing!?
michael_scott Maybe.
pam_beesly Wow.
michael_scott Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
pam_beesly Yea. Yea no problem.
michael_scott Pam.
pam_beesly Yep.
erin_hannon Could you light this please?
pam_beesly Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
michael_scott I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
pam_beesly This is terrible.
michael_scott No, this is romantic.
pam_beesly You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
ryan_howard Free sample?
ryan_howard My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
dwight_schrute You got this kosher certified?
ryan_howard No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
dwight_schrute Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects.
ryan_howard Thank you. Whatcha got there?
dwight_schrute Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
dwight_schrute things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
dwight_schrute Jim, put those away.
jim_halpert I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
dwight_schrute just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
jim_halpert They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now.
pam_beesly Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
michael_scott Why?
pam_beesly You called the meeting I don't..
michael_scott I did?
michael_scott Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
pam_beesly Michael.
michael_scott Yes.
pam_beesly We are a family.
michael_scott I could not have agreed with you more.
pam_beesly And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
michael_scott Yes. Thank you.
pam_beesly So about this proposal thing...
michael_scott No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
pam_beesly Michael, she's perfect for you.
oscar_martinez She's the one.
jim_halpert She's amazing. This is very exciting.
pam_beesly So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
michael_scott I had a great idea until you ruined it.
oscar_martinez Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
andy_bernard Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
kevin_malone Nice.
andy_bernard And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
kevin_malone No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
andy_bernard Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
darryl_philbin And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
andy_bernard Oooh.
darryl_philbin Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
kevin_malone no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
darryl_philbin It was in the box.
andy_bernard Well played.
darryl_philbin Thank you.
andy_bernard We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
kevin_malone No but that's not fair.
andy_bernard Well that's Dallas.
darryl_philbin Dallas indeed.
oscar_martinez What... Ryan, where did you get this picture?
ryan_howard My mom also makes the best salsa.
holly_flax This is your moms old stuff?
phyllis_vance Yeah mostly.
holly_flax How's she doing?
phyllis_vance It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
holly_flax How do you know when its time?
phyllis_vance Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
holly_flax Let me see.
pam_beesly Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
ryan_howard Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
michael_scott How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
jim_halpert That's a guarantee.
michael_scott It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
jim_halpert Don't think you need the corpse then.
michael_scott Heres the ring.
pam_beesly Holy s*** is that real?
michael_scott Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
oscar_martinez No.
michael_scott Is she not going to like that?
pam_beesly No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
oscar_martinez Where was that.
jim_halpert At a gas station.
michael_scott At a gas station?
jim_halpert Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
michael_scott That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
pam_beesly No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
michael_scott Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
jim_halpert Totally reasonable.
michael_scott I just... it's terrifying.
pam_beesly She's not gonna say no.
michael_scott I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
jim_halpert Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
pam_beesly You were scared?
jim_halpert Yeah... it.s scary.
michael_scott Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
holly_flax Look I need to talk to you.
michael_scott Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
holly_flax I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
michael_scott Oh ok. For how long?
holly_flax I don't know.
michael_scott Is he alright?
holly_flax Yeah.
michael_scott You ok?
holly_flax Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
michael_scott Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
holly_flax And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
michael_scott Ok.
holly_flax And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
michael_scott No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
holly_flax Uh, what?
michael_scott No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
kevin_malone Hey guys it's my turn.
andy_bernard You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
kevin_malone Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
darryl_philbin I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
kevin_malone This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
darryl_philbin Yeah where is it?
kevin_malone Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
kevin_malone And that is Dallas.
ryan_howard Nice.
jim_halpert Not bad right.
ryan_howard Can't really tell the...
jim_halpert Nice.
dwight_schrute I know right... what the?
jim_halpert Oh my God.
dwight_schrute That... that's impossible.
jim_halpert It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
dwight_schrute All right, I'll take them.
jim_halpert They're probably worthless.
dwight_schrute Probably.
jim_halpert Leave the telescope.
dwight_schrute I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
michael_scott Hey, how'd we do?
holly_flax 13 dollars.
michael_scott That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
holly_flax Listen about earlier ...
michael_scott No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
holly_flax It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
michael_scott Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
michael_scott So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
holly_flax Why?
michael_scott This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
michael_scott This is where we first kissed.
holly_flax I remember.
michael_scott And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
holly_flax Michael..
michael_scott Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
holly_flax Yes.
michael_scott In-grown hair.
michael_scott Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
holly_flax Mh hmm.
michael_scott We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
holly_flax Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
michael_scott And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
michael_scott And over here..
holly_flax What happened here?
michael_scott Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do.
holly_flax Nice
michael_scott Let's go in here.
holly_flax Hi guys.
michael_scott This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
jim_halpert Holly, will you marry me?
holly_flax No.
stanley_hudson Marry me Holly.
holly_flax No.
michael_scott That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
oscar_martinez Will you marry me?
holly_flax No.
michael_scott That marriage would be a sham.
gabe_lewis Will you marry me?
holly_flax No.
michael_scott Easy no.
angela_martin Will you marry me?
holly_flax No.
michael_scott That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
ryan_howard Will you marry me Holly?
holly_flax No.
michael_scott Only one that I was kind of worried about.
michael_scott This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
holly_flax Your wife becoming me will I.
kevin_malone That's awesome!
pam_beesly Congratulations!
jim_halpert Congratulations!
michael_scott Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
kevin_malone All of us?
michael_scott Yep.
jim_halpert Wait, what?
michael_scott Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
