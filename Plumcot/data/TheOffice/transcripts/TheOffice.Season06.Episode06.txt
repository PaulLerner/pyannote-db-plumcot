michael_scott The fundamentals of business. The funda-mentals of business. "Mental" is part of the word, I have underlined it. Because you're mental, if you don't have a good time. You have to enjoy it.
toby_flenderson Well the "fun" is in it.
michael_scott Get out.
toby_flenderson Yeah, I know.
michael_scott Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk." What topics can you use for small talk?
andy_bernard Golf.
michael_scott Mmhm.
andy_bernard Stock market.
michael_scott Mmhm.
andy_bernard Dave Matthews.
michael_scott Yes, what else?
creed_bratton Uh, small things. Peas, ball bearings, dimes...
michael_scott No.
meredith_palmer The weekend!
michael_scott Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
meredith_palmer Well I caught my son taking a dump on the upper part of the toilet.
michael_scott All right...
meredith_palmer He calls it an upper decker.
michael_scott Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.
ryan_howard Then do it.
michael_scott What?
ryan_howard Write a book.
michael_scott The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...
erin_hannon Mr. Grotti, this is Michael Scott. He's the person you should talk to.
michael_scott Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
erin_hannon In your schedule it just says nine til noon is "creative space" and I thought this could be part of that.
michael_scott Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
erin_hannon You don't have anything in the afternoon. It just says "free play."
michael_scott Push free play til tomorrow morning. Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
grotti Ah.
michael_scott Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
grotti As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride.
michael_scott Mmhm.
grotti But you also got a lot of responsibility
michael_scott Yep.
grotti None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.
michael_scott Okay.
michael_scott There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.
kevin_malone Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
andy_bernard What do you think?
dwight_schrute I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
grotti God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse.
michael_scott Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
grotti Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury.
michael_scott Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
grotti You will be hearing from me Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Okay, well.
grotti I can be very very persistent.
michael_scott Do your worst.
michael_scott Oh, great.
grotti Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?
michael_scott Mmhm.
andy_bernard What happened in there?
michael_scott Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
dwight_schrute Did he threaten you?
michael_scott No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
andy_bernard Mobsters are!
michael_scott There is no such things as monsters.
andy_bernard He drives an SUV!
dwight_schrute I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
oscar_martinez Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
dwight_schrute No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
michael_scott Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
andy_bernard All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.
oscar_martinez For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
michael_scott I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
andy_bernard Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!
dwight_schrute Exactly.
michael_scott He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
oscar_martinez Uhh. All right, who else is here?
oscar_martinez Pam and Jim are on their honeymoon. So there's not the usual balance between "sane and others." Toby has mentally checked out since June. It's a very dangerous time. The "coalition for reason" is extremely weak.
toby_flenderson Oscar says I checked out huh? Huh.
michael_scott Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down. Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?
ryan_howard Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
michael_scott Okay.
ryan_howard What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
michael_scott Um it is, Grotti.
andy_bernard and Dwight Oh no. Fabulous.
oscar_martinez What? What?
andy_bernard It's John Gotti, you idiot!
oscar_martinez It's, it's a completely different name!
phyllis_vance So he won't get caught!
andy_bernard Yeah. It's pretty close.
oscar_martinez No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it.
dwight_schrute No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck."
michael_scott Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
dwight_schrute Lock your door!
michael_scott I'm not gonna lock my door.
jim_halpert Hello?
oscar_martinez Jim? It's Oscar. I'm so sorry to be calling you on your honeymoon.
jim_halpert Oscar! Uh, what is going on?
oscar_martinez It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
jim_halpert Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-
pam_beesly Hey Oscar. It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.
oscar_martinez Pam, I'm sorry--
pam_beesly Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.
oscar_martinez You're right. You're right. Oh, okay bye.
michael_scott It's Grotti. He's following up.
andy_bernard Already? This, this guy is persistent!
michael_scott "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."
dwight_schrute That's bad.
michael_scott Yeah.
dwight_schrute That's bad.
michael_scott Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
andy_bernard Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.
michael_scott Okay, I'm calling the police.
andy_bernard That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!
dwight_schrute He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
michael_scott All right.
andy_bernard Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!
michael_scott Shh!
dwight_schrute You know what?
michael_scott That's not gonna happen.
dwight_schrute That's an exaggeration.
andy_bernard That's how it works!
michael_scott What am I supposed to do here?
andy_bernard When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
michael_scott I was thinking exactly the same thing.
dwight_schrute No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
andy_bernard Dwight...
dwight_schrute The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
michael_scott I don't know, I don't know about that.
andy_bernard Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
dwight_schrute Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
andy_bernard Okay.
dwight_schrute Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
andy_bernard I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
michael_scott Hold on, hold on! Just-
andy_bernard No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.
michael_scott All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.
andy_bernard Well you're gonna have to. Dwight We'll be right beside you.
andy_bernard What?
michael_scott What are you wearing? Who's Pat?
andy_bernard Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
dwight_schrute Do you know how to use it?
andy_bernard To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.
michael_scott Let's go, come on. God!
andy_bernard Should I change?
dwight_schrute You're wearing loafers!
michael_scott Forget it! Forget it!
michael_scott Take that thing off the table! Please!
andy_bernard Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
dwight_schrute Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
andy_bernard Oh! God!
michael_scott Oh my God!
dwight_schrute You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
michael_scott Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
michael_scott Hello.
grotti Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
grotti Hi. Angelo Grotti.
andy_bernard Hi.
dwight_schrute Hello.
grotti So, you got this table?
michael_scott Yes.
grotti This is one of those half booths, can't-decide-what-it-is type of thing.
michael_scott Well.
grotti Waitress, we're gonna sit over here.
alice That's fine.
michael_scott Okay.
kevin_malone Hello.
Credit#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 card rep Hello Mr. Halpert. I'm calling from the identity theft department at Capital One. We've detected some unusual activity on your credit card.
kevin_malone Oh man, do you think it was stolen?
Rep#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 First would you mind verifying your home address?
kevin_malone Um, yes. Um, 383 Linden Ave., Scranton PA
Rep#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 And may I have the last four numbers of your Social Security Number?
kevin_malone Six-six-five-zero.
Rep#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 Well Mr. Halpert. You're obviously not in San Juan Puerto Rico.
kevin_malone Wait a minute. Yes I am.
Rep#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card.
kevin_malone No. That... I, I think that we should let the criminal use the card a little longer.
Rep#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 Very funny sir. We'll get a new card out to you right away.
kevin_malone No-
Rep#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 Have a nice day, and thank you!
kevin_malone Shoot.
grotti If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.
dwight_schrute Oh he's not that nice.
michael_scott That's not true.
andy_bernard Hmm. Very true.
michael_scott Okay shut up.
alice Have you decided?
grotti Yeah, I'll have the linguini, red sauce on the side. If the sauce does not come on the side, I will send it back. I want garlic bread, toasted, not burnt. If it comes burnt, I will send it back.
alice Okay then. And for you sir?
michael_scott I will have the gabba-gool.
alice The... what?
michael_scott The gabba-gool.
alice I don't really know what that is.
andy_bernard You know, gabba-gool.
michael_scott I don't, I don't have to have that.
dwight_schrute What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
michael_scott Guys, guys-
alice I don't really think that we have that.
michael_scott That's okay.
dwight_schrute Bring him the gabba-gool!
michael_scott Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
alice Okay.
michael_scott If the salad is on top, I send it back.
oscar_martinez Why would you cancel Jim's credit cards?
kevin_malone I usually can think quick on my feet, but they were so fast on the phone.
oscar_martinez This constitutes identity fraud.
kevin_malone Oh God. I wouldn't last in jail Oscar. I'm not like you.
oscar_martinez What's that supposed to mean?
kevin_malone Oh you don't know about jail? Oh you would love jail.
oscar_martinez Why would I love jail?
kevin_malone Because... You would love it.
michael_scott I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.
grotti Look closely Michael. I feel there's a plan here for you.
andy_bernard Maybe we have a plan for you?
grotti How about you? Maybe you can use supplemental coverage of some kind. Anybody can get hurt! You always think, it can't happen to you, and Think about it.
son Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Are you a mechanic?
andy_bernard Yeeeeah.
son My battery is dead, I've got my kid, can you please help?
andy_bernard Yes I can.
michael_scott No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.
grotti Come on! Lady in distress? Go! Go!
andy_bernard Okay!
son Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.
michael_scott Hey, do you need any help?
grotti I'm sure he can handle a simple jump-start. Now come on, sit down.
michael_scott He's a good mechanic.
grotti Where were we?
michael_scott I don't...
dwight_schrute He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
michael_scott Okay, okay okay.
dwight_schrute So we're choosing...
michael_scott Yep, all right.
dwight_schrute Check out Dental?
michael_scott Put it down.
andy_bernard Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.
Kid#unknown#TheOffice.Season06.Episode06 He seems bad at this.
andy_bernard You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. Aaaah! You got a leaky spark tube.
son What?!?
andy_bernard So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles.
grotti Now if you could just sign this letter of intent, I'll bring this back to my boss, and we can get this in motion. You okay, Pat?
andy_bernard Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.
grotti Aren't you a mechanic? Why wouldn't you put oil in the car?
andy_bernard It was before, my tech- my technical training.
dwight_schrute Don't do it!
andy_bernard Do it.
dwight_schrute Don't.
andy_bernard Just do it.
michael_scott Okay.
grotti Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?
dwight_schrute Yes.
michael_scott Okay.
dwight_schrute I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
michael_scott It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
andy_bernard You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.
michael_scott I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
dwight_schrute It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
michael_scott It was a lot of snap decisions.
dwight_schrute Do you know what "snap decision" means?
michael_scott Yes!
dwight_schrute It means like this.
michael_scott Just get in the car.
jim_halpert Hello?
michael_scott Jim?
jim_halpert Michael?
michael_scott Oh thank God.
jim_halpert How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.
michael_scott It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
jim_halpert That sounds bad.
michael_scott Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
jim_halpert I'm gonna help you through it all right?
michael_scott Okay!
jim_halpert All you're gonna need to and- it- and then go to--
michael_scott Jim? Are you?
jim_halpert And then you'll be saved.
michael_scott What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
jim_halpert Just and then you'll be saved.
michael_scott No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
jim_halpert A- ah--
michael_scott No! Oh my God!
jim_halpert And you'll be saved.
michael_scott No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!
jim_halpert I at the Bermuda Triangle. An- M- please don't call again.
michael_scott Jim?!? Oh my God.
michael_scott Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?
oscar_martinez Accounting-wise, no. But phone-wise, just call up and cancel it.
michael_scott Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
oscar_martinez Just- no. No.
michael_scott All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
dwight_schrute We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
andy_bernard He's alive. So you're welcome.
dwight_schrute Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
andy_bernard Yeah, some of that existed before.
dwight_schrute Not the living in fear, that's new.
andy_bernard You're right, that is new.
dwight_schrute Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
andy_bernard Well I don't see that happening.
dwight_schrute Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
andy_bernard Are you saying-
dwight_schrute Yeah...
andy_bernard That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?
dwight_schrute What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
andy_bernard That seems a little far-fetched.
dwight_schrute Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.
dwight_schrute Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
michael_scott No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
andy_bernard No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy. His background is perfectly clean.
dwight_schrute It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
andy_bernard Class act. Boy scout.
michael_scott But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
andy_bernard He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
dwight_schrute And he made us all look like chumps!
michael_scott
michael_scott If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.
grotti This is Grotti.
michael_scott This is Scott.
grotti Oh! Great. Michael, I'm finishing up your paperwork right now.
michael_scott Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
grotti I, I thought you'd be pleased.
michael_scott Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
grotti What?
michael_scott I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
grotti I don't get it. How was I scaring you?
michael_scott I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
andy_bernard Whoa. Okay.
michael_scott You suck!
dwight_schrute Okay that's-
michael_scott And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
dwight_schrute That's good, let's wrap it up.
michael_scott How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
grotti Look, Michael, when we all calm down here, maybe at some point in the future, you change your mind, why don't you give me a call?
michael_scott Doubt it.
dwight_schrute and Andy Oh man.
michael_scott What a tool. What?
andy_bernard Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
michael_scott No. What do you mean?
dwight_schrute We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute You successfully backed down the mob!
andy_bernard You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!
michael_scott Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
michael_scott So I looked him in the eye and I said, "Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead." I said something like that.
dwight_schrute Very close.
oscar_martinez Just to be clear, he backed down an insurance agent from Mutual of Harrisburg.
michael_scott Erin?
erin_hannon Yes?
michael_scott Coffee?
erin_hannon Okay.
michael_scott Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
erin_hannon Okay.
michael_scott Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
erin_hannon How do you return coffee?
michael_scott Go. Any questions?
pam_beesly Are you kidding me?
kevin_malone Hi Pam, is Jim there?
pam_beesly Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!
kevin_malone Okay, that sounds good. Um, I'll let you go, just -tell Jim, that I said hi.
pam_beesly Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
kevin_malone Cool. Okay. Bye.
kevin_malone They have no idea what happened.
