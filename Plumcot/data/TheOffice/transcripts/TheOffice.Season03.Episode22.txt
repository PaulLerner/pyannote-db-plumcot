michael_scott Ughh... Blech.
dwight_schrute OK, where does it hurt?
michael_scott Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
dwight_schrute No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
michael_scott Right there.
dwight_schrute "Abdomen. Menses."
michael_scott Maybe.
dwight_schrute "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."
michael_scott Not it. I don't have eggs.
pam_beesly About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
dwight_schrute Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
michael_scott That's possible.
pam_beesly Michael?
michael_scott Uh-huh?
pam_beesly David Wallace is on line one.
michael_scott The CFO? Ohh...
michael_scott OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
michael_scott To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
david_wallace Michael, I am calling---
michael_scott And Gromit. Jan? Is Jan there?
david_wallace Jan is out of town right now.
michael_scott Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
david_wallace Michael?
michael_scott ...you just gots to get your freak on.
david_wallace Michael?
michael_scott Yeah.
david_wallace Michael?
michael_scott Hmmm.
david_wallace I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
michael_scott Really?
david_wallace Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
michael_scott Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
david_wallace That's not necessary.
michael_scott May God guide you in your quest.
david_wallace Yes.
michael_scott OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
meredith_palmer Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt Oh, yeah... I packed it in my purse.
michael_scott Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
oscar_martinez I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
michael_scott Well, you can't swim in leather pants. I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally.
toby_flenderson Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
michael_scott Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
toby_flenderson It's Beach Day...
michael_scott Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
michael_scott I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
toby_flenderson Hey, want my sun screen?
pam_beesly Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
toby_flenderson Uh-huh.
pam_beesly Thanks Toby.
michael_scott Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
pam_beesly I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
michael_scott We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
michael_scott What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
pam_beesly You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
michael_scott I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
pam_beesly I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
michael_scott This way to the partay bus.
kevin_malone I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
kevin_malone And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right." You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
michael_scott Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
stanley_hudson Oh, sweet mother of God.
michael_scott If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
stanley_hudson Excuse me?
michael_scott Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
dwight_schrute Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
michael_scott Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
dwight_schrute I hope there will be management parables.
michael_scott Well, Hey Pam, did you get that down?
pam_beesly Like what?
michael_scott Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
pam_beesly Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
michael_scott Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
michael_scott Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. Watch out for snakes!
angela_martin Everyone put on sunscreen.
michael_scott Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
oscar_martinez What?
michael_scott Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
dwight_schrute Yes!
michael_scott Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
michael_scott Jim Halpert. Pros smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
dwight_schrute I choose Michael!
michael_scott I'm not playing.
dwight_schrute OK, temp.
michael_scott Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
michael_scott We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
dwight_schrute We will be called Gryffindor.
jim_halpert Really? Not Slytherin?
dwight_schrute Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
jim_halpert I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
dwight_schrute He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
jim_halpert Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
dwight_schrute OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
michael_scott Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
stanley_hudson I don't care what you call my team.
michael_scott Then I will name your team the Red team.
stanley_hudson No , the blue team.
michael_scott I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
andy_bernard We will be team U.S.A.
michael_scott Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
michael_scott Andy Bernard. Pros He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons I don't really trust him.
michael_scott It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
stanley_hudson There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
michael_scott Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!
oscar_martinez Come on Phyllis, you can do it. Ahh...
stanley_hudson Thank you so much.
andy_bernard Phyllis is out. Yes! Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good.
kelly_kapoor I don't want to hit the big rock!
andy_bernard Don't worry. You're not...
kelly_kapoor I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
andy_bernard No where near the big rock.
kelly_kapoor I just don't want to get hit by it...
andy_bernard What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
andy_bernard I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard!
jim_halpert Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
karen_filippelli Hole?
jim_halpert Yup. Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
dwight_schrute Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
ryan_howard Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
dwight_schrute What are you saying?
ryan_howard You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
dwight_schrute OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
ryan_howard That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
dwight_schrute I am trying to bring team spirit.
jim_halpert Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. Yes!
karen_filippelli Oh my God! You ass!
pam_beesly There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking.
michael_scott Pam...you're missing things.
dwight_schrute Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you b*st*rd! What the? Damn it temp!
andy_bernard Great job everyone, that was fantastic.
michael_scott Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
pam_beesly Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
michael_scott Smart as a whip! Yes! These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
pam_beesly When's the contest?
michael_scott Like umm... ten minutes?
pam_beesly How am I supposed to... get...
michael_scott Thanks a bunch.
michael_scott A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
michael_scott OK, who's hungry No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
kelly_kapoor Can I have a turkey burger?
michael_scott No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
oscar_martinez Turkey is a healthy meat.
dwight_schrute It's very good for you.
michael_scott Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
phyllis_vance Is there any mustard?
michael_scott No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
michael_scott Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
meredith_palmer What is it?
michael_scott I can't say.
jim_halpert You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
michael_scott The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
kelly_kapoor Can we just take those first two things?
michael_scott The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
dwight_schrute You're leaving?
michael_scott I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
andy_bernard I am so hungry!
stanley_hudson Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
michael_scott Word. There we go. Let's see it.
stanley_hudson I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
michael_scott Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
kelly_kapoor Team U.S.A.!
andy_bernard One came up.
michael_scott 13 hot dogs, everybody!
dwight_schrute Damn it!
creed_bratton Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
dwight_schrute Sabotage.
angela_martin What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
dwight_schrute No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
angela_martin I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
dwight_schrute If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
michael_scott It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
stanley_hudson Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
michael_scott Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.
karen_filippelli Get 'em big boy!
michael_scott Aaaaaand, go!
karen_filippelli C'mon, Jim!
stanley_hudson
jim_halpert What are you doing?
michael_scott Nice, Stanley!
stanley_hudson Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
jim_halpert Yeah. No. Good.
jim_halpert Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
oscar_martinez If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
dwight_schrute Gaaaaa....
michael_scott One. Two. Three.
dwight_schrute Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
michael_scott Excellent!
dwight_schrute Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
andy_bernard I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
dwight_schrute That's not why you lost.
andy_bernard Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
dwight_schrute Yeah, right.
andy_bernard Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon!
dwight_schrute Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
andy_bernard Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
angela_martin What, Andy? Andy, what should I tell them?
andy_bernard Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!
angela_martin I don't understand what you want from me.
andy_bernard Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
angela_martin Sorry! Bye, Andy!
andy_bernard Angela!
michael_scott I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
pam_beesly I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
michael_scott Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
pam_beesly I really doubt it, Michael.
michael_scott Please just check.
jim_halpert Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
karen_filippelli Hello? Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
jim_halpert In well?
karen_filippelli As well.
jim_halpert How would that work in well? I just want to know.
karen_filippelli Yes. uh, huh.
jim_halpert Wait a minute.
karen_filippelli That would be fine.
jim_halpert If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
karen_filippelli Cut it out!
jim_halpert I don't!
michael_scott What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
stanley_hudson How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
michael_scott Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
michael_scott Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
kevin_malone Are you going to try it?
angela_martin I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
kevin_malone Angela, it is a million degrees.
pam_beesly I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
michael_scott No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
pam_beesly I'd like to try it.
michael_scott Pointless.
pam_beesly But I'm not kidding. I really want to do it.
michael_scott Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
jim_halpert Nope.
michael_scott Ji.. why not? C'mon.
jim_halpert Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
michael_scott You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
jim_halpert That's harsh.
michael_scott Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
andy_bernard Hello? Who's there? My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin. Hello?
kevin_malone Why don't you go Michael?
michael_scott Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
jim_halpert And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
michael_scott Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. The mind has to wrap around the foot. Okay.
pam_beesly Do you want us to count to three?
michael_scott Yes. Count to three, please.
all@ Three. Two. One.
michael_scott Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
all@ One. Two. Three! Go! Do it! Go, Michael.
michael_scott Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
creed_bratton On the go that's after three.
michael_scott Okay.
all@ One, two, three, go!
dwight_schrute No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
michael_scott Don't, don't.
dwight_schrute I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
all@ Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving.
dwight_schrute GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!
michael_scott I'm not going to give it to you.
dwight_schrute Aaagh, aaagh!
all@
pam_beesly Michael, do something!
dwight_schrute Aggggh, that stings!
michael_scott Being the boss is also about image. I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. "Outside Hire."
angela_martin Or Mrs. "Outside Hire."
michael_scott Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
kelly_kapoor Who's Bob Hope?
michael_scott God! He's a comedian.
kelly_kapoor Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
michael_scott Who's Amanda Bynes?
kelly_kapoor She's from "What a Girl Wants."
michael_scott Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
jim_halpert Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
michael_scott You are being too modest.
jim_halpert Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
michael_scott Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
dwight_schrute The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!"
pam_beesly Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
dwight_schrute I mean truly repulsive acts.
michael_scott That is a very, very funny story.
pam_beesly Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that. Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now. Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you. That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist. Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends. And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
michael_scott Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
all@ Flintstones, meet the Flintstones. They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da. From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!
michael_scott WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
andy_bernard Nice!
