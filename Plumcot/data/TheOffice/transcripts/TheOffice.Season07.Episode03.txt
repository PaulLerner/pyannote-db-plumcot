erin_hannon Andy?
jim_halpert Yes!
erin_hannon Did you write this?
andy_bernard No.
erin_hannon Who did?
andy_bernard Steven Sondheim.
erin_hannon Who is he?
angela_martin What the hell is happening?
andy_bernard We're the cast of Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We open in a couple weeks at the Loose Screw Playhouse here in Scranton and today just doing a wee bit of viral marketing.
michael_scott That was amazing! That was awesome! I auditioned for this. When did the cast list go up?
andy_bernard Like a month ago.
michael_scott Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
andy_bernard Two comps. For my lady and her Gabe. It's closing night. Tomorrow we have to give the theater over to the Scranton's Miss Fitness pageant.
erin_hannon I am so excited. But I just need one. Gabe can't come. Sorry.
andy_bernard What? That's awful. Everyone's gonna miss that guy.
andy_bernard Gabe is not coming, which is huge because my plan is to make Erin fall back in love with me tonight. Women cannot resist a man singing show tunes. It's so powerful, even a lot of men can't resist a man singing show tunes.
erin_hannon Oh, who else is going?
andy_bernard Everyone.
erin_hannon Gabe seemed to think no one was going.
andy_bernard What kind of terrible rumor monger is Gabe? He is woefully misinformed, all right? Excuse me, clink, clink, clink, clink, everybody. You're all coming to my show tonight, right?
michael_scott Andy, what time's the show?
andy_bernard 8pm sharp.
michael_scott How long is it?
andy_bernard Hour forty-five.
michael_scott Nope, can't make it.
michael_scott They say that no one can take your pride, but the people who cast Andy's play, they took mine.
andy_bernard Jim, Pam, you guys are in, right?
pam_beesly Oh, we wanted to, but our sitter just fell through. I'm really sorry.
andy_bernard Dwight?
dwight_schrute Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
andy_bernard It would mean so much to me if you came to my show tonight.
michael_scott I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
andy_bernard If it makes you feel any better, no one who auditioned for the part of Sweeney Todd got that part. They had to bring in a ringer.
michael_scott Wow.
andy_bernard This guy's like world-class. You should not feel bad. I'm asking you thespian to thespian. Will you please be the bigger man and come to my show?
michael_scott I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play.
andy_bernard Noishe!
michael_scott And scene.
angela_martin Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
dwight_schrute Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
dwight_schrute Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
dwight_schrute Give me the punch card.
angela_martin No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
dwight_schrute That is not in the contract.
angela_martin Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?
dwight_schrute Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
angela_martin Thank you.
angela_martin Dwight and I have a contractual agreement to procreate five times, plain and simple. And should he develop feelings for me, well, that would be permissible under item 7C, clause 2, so I would not object.
andy_bernard Hey, how are those salads?
jim_halpert It's my own fault-
andy_bernard My parents used to scramble to find babysitters so they could take my younger brother to do stuff. I understand how hard it can be. I just-tonight, if you could...
pam_beesly We'll keep looking.
andy_bernard Yes!
jim_halpert Really?
pam_beesly I mean, who knows? Maybe I have a niece my family never told me about.
andy_bernard Oh my gosh, that would be amazing.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert For a lot of reasons.
andy_bernard Yeah, I know. Neiche!
michael_scott Oh, hey guys.
stanley_hudson You brought balloons to a play?
michael_scott I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
phyllis_vance It's nice, like Up.
michael_scott Yes.
usher Excuse me, are you the guy who did an entire Law & Order episode for his audition?
michael_scott Nope.
andy_bernard Guys?
all@ Hey! Andy!
andy_bernard You all made it, thank you so much.
jim_halpert You should actually thank Erin, she's the one who agreed to babysit.
andy_bernard She's babysitting?
erin_hannon I really wanted to see Andy's play, because he's so, so talented. But I've been trying to get in the babysitting game forever. The thirteen-year-olds in this town have a complete monopoly. It's almost like a babysitters club.
andy_bernard I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.
michael_scott This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.
darryl_philbin Hey, I think this guy playing Sweeney Todd is my plumber.
michael_scott No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber.
darryl_philbin No, it's my plumber. Says so in his bio. Apparently the director discovered him doing karaoke. It's his first play. He didn't even audition.
michael_scott Are you kidding me?
darryl_philbin Shhh. If we don't listen to the overture, we won't recognize the musical themes when they come back later.
michael_scott All right, I'm sorry. God.
usher Excuse me, I think you may be in the wrong seats.
kelly_kapoor Ooooh!
dwight_schrute I work with that guy.
angela_martin Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
dwight_schrute Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
angela_martin Oh, Dwight, just move.
dwight_schrute His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
kelly_kapoor What time is it?
shelby_thomas_weems Michael! Shelby Thomas Weemes, the director.
michael_scott Hello.
shelby_thomas_weems I promise you that if you keep auditioning with similar gusto...
michael_scott Okay.
shelby_thomas_weems We are going to find a production with a role for Michael Scott.
michael_scott Okay.
shelby_thomas_weems Yes?
michael_scott Yes.
shelby_thomas_weems Good.
michael_scott Good.
shelby_thomas_weems Enjoy the second act.
michael_scott You enjoy the second act.
shelby_thomas_weems Have a refreshment.
michael_scott Thank you. You, too.
angela_martin Come on, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
angela_martin These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
dwight_schrute Let's go.
pam_beesly Hey, Erin, it's Pam. How ya doing? No, no, don't put Cece on the phone, because she can't talk yet. Okay. No, I was just calling to see how everything's going. Yeah? Yeah? It's good? The play? The play is kind of great. I mean, it's fun to hear Andy sing in the appropriate setting. Now, he's really sorry you couldn't make it, too. Yeah. So thank you so much, again. We're having a great time. Oh, they're flashing the lights so we should go in. Thanks. Bye. Okay, so we called. And everything's fine!
jim_halpert Everything's fine.
pam_beesly We can relax.
jim_halpert We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.
meredith_palmer Michael!
andy_bernard Just checking my e-mails. See if I got any last-minute "break a legs" or "I still love you" type texts. Doesn't look like I got anything. Maybe on my Facebook wall.
creed_bratton Unfortunately, in this ham-fisted production of Sweeney Todd, the real terror comes from the vocal performances. New paragraph.
andy_bernard Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd! I found her!
sweeney_todd Todd You found Johanna.
andy_bernard That monster of a judge has locked her-. Locked her away.
sweeney_todd Todd There's a little bird fluttering around. Do hope it ceases chirping.
michael_scott How is that funny?
sweeney_todd Todd The bird continues to call. Someone please turn off your... bird. Oh, for the love-turn your phone off! There are signs!
andy_bernard Oh, it appears the bird was in mine own pocket this whole time. He's gone to sleep now, I've closed his beak.
sweeney_todd Todd What is the news of my darling daughter Johanna?
andy_bernard You know what? Let me just double check, that bird... Okay, good. It's off. I mean, silenced. I silenced it by killing it. I've killed it! I'm a murderer! Just like you, Sweeney Todd. See, it all connects. Not that I know you're a murderer. My character doesn't know that yet. But I'm suspicious, because of all the razors that you have laying around. And you spend time alone. But you're a barber, so that's legit. So there's that. But...
sweeney_todd Todd Where is Johanna?
andy_bernard A madhouse.
sweeney_todd Todd A madhouse?
andy_bernard Yes, a madhouse.
sweeney_todd Todd A madhouse? Johanna is as good as rescued. Where do you suppose all the wig makes of London go to obtain their human hair?
andy_bernard Do you think... so you think...
sweeney_todd Todd Fogg's Asylum , why not?
pam_beesly Sounds like Cece.
jim_halpert Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
pam_beesly Oh, my God! Go, go!
jim_halpert Oh, my God.
andy_bernard That's really irresponsible of Erin. She's a terrible babysitter.
erin_hannon I just didn't think that you guys were gonna see us. We were just gonna stop by and get some ice cream and then go home.
jim_halpert Okay, this was pretty simple-
pam_beesly Why are you here?
jim_halpert Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed.
pam_beesly What possible explanation could you have for possibly being here? I don't... you know, babies shouldn't have ice cream, by the way.
erin_hannon I'm sorry. I just really wanted to see Andy. You guys made it sound so unmissable, and you set me up with a car seat and everything.
jim_halpert Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
erin_hannon Oh, no, why would I take her to the hospital?
pam_beesly You know what? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
erin_hannon Why don't I just take her home and let you guys finish, and then you should stay out as late as you want.
jim_halpert No, we're good. Thank you, though.
erin_hannon Okay. Alright, bye Cece.
pam_beesly Okay.
jim_halpert Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again.
pam_beesly Not together!
michael_scott Boo! Boo!
angela_martin That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
dwight_schrute All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
angela_martin Where's my car? Come on.
michael_scott Mmm! Fruit is so much better when it's dried. I've already eaten, like, 30 apricots.
sweeney_todd Todd Darryl?
darryl_philbin Hey!
sweeney_todd Todd Didn't know you were gonna be here. How's the toilet?
darryl_philbin Silent. Look, congratulations.
sweeney_todd Todd Thank you.
darryl_philbin I had no idea. This plumber has pipes!
michael_scott Yeah, good job. Well done.
sweeney_todd Todd You're the guy who booed me.
michael_scott Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.
sweeney_todd Todd No, I saw you, and you were the only one.
michael_scott Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
creed_bratton Be cool, Michael. I saw this guy kill a bunch of people. Good work.
sweeney_todd Todd Thank you.
darryl_philbin You didn't have to boo him.
michael_scott Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
darryl_philbin How would you like it if we booed you?
michael_scott That would never happen.
darryl_philbin Boo! Boo!
michael_scott Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
darryl_philbin Boo! Boo!
michael_scott I don't like that at all.
andy_bernard Are you ready?
erin_hannon Yes. Oh, I'm so scared! Okay, kill me! Just kill me! Kill me!
andy_bernard Ah! Blood everywhere.
erin_hannon Oh, no. I'm so glad we're hanging out again outside of work.
andy_bernard Yeah, me, too.
erin_hannon Okay, I kill you now.
andy_bernard Okay.
dwight_schrute All right, let's do this.
angela_martin No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
dwight_schrute It's okay, I smell.
angela_martin No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
dwight_schrute No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have s*x.
angela_martin Well, I won't tell if you don't.
dwight_schrute I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it.
angela_martin Good night, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Good night.
andy_bernard These would have been your seats. Best seats in the house. Lots of people think it would be the front row, but actually, right here, this is where the speakers converge, and the sound just, like, nails you right here.
erin_hannon This is awesome. Sorry. Hi, Gabe. Yeah, I just stopped by Andy's cast party to say hi to everyone. Oh, sure, I can pick you up some soup. What do you want? That's broth, Gabe. Okay, I-I'll see you soup. Okay, I have to go. Thank you so much. This is so much fun, and I'm really sorry that I missed your play, but next time I'll be there. Or here. Right here, I promise.
andy_bernard Awesome.
erin_hannon Okay.
andy_bernard See you later.
erin_hannon Thank you.
jim_halpert It's like The Hurt Locker!
pam_beesly This night was a disaster.
jim_halpert No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
pam_beesly Yeah?
jim_halpert We could put that in orange juice.
pam_beesly Get it.
jim_halpert Yeah?
pam_beesly Let's get our juice on.
jim_halpert Yeah!
phyllis_vance Found him!
michael_scott Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?
andy_bernard Yeah, I guess you could say that.
michael_scott Yeah, I get those every day after work.
phyllis_vance Your show was really great, Andy.
stanley_hudson Interesting subject matter. I'm surprised you pulled it off.
andy_bernard It was like amateur hour.
oscar_martinez It was an amateur production, technically.
michael_scott Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
andy_bernard Stop just saying that.
michael_scott I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
andy_bernard Thank you. That feels good.
michael_scott I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
darryl_philbin Andy, sing us another song.
andy_bernard Thanks, but I feel like a loner right now.
phyllis_vance Oh, come on, Andy, you were the highlight.
michael_scott Come on, Andy, seriously.
all@ Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy!
andy_bernard Okay, all right, all right, all right.
andy_bernard
michael_scott In the criminal justice system, the people are defended by two separate but equally important groups, the police who investigate the crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories. Kun-kun! I'm just a cleaning lady. Aah! A dead body. He wrapped his belt around his own neck. It looks like a classic case of autoerotic asphyxiation. Yeah, looks like everyone's tightening their belts in this economy. Last time you saw the victim, was he happy? Last time I saw this John, he was-he wasn't a victim, if you know what I'm talkin about.
shelby_thomas_weems Thanks you.
michael_scott No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
