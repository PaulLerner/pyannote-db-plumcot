country_club_snob Employee Vancouver Court Hotel, how many I help you?
michael_scott Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America! I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.
country_club_snob Employee Well, we are looking forward to having you, so, let me just pull up your information here...
michael_scott Okey doke.
country_club_snob Employee Um, I don't seem to have it, sir.
michael_scott What?
dwight_schrute I'm not seeing anything under "confirmation."
michael_scott No.
dwight_schrute Could it be under "affirmation?" Cause you have thousands of those.
michael_scott No. We're trying to look it up right now.
dwight_schrute You did get the e-vite to my barbeque!
michael_scott Um, come on.
dwight_schrute Michael...
country_club_snob Employee Uh, sir? A lot of people are trying to get last-minute reservations at hotels here for the Olympics, but we've been fully booked for months.
michael_scott Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
dwight_schrute Wait, I got it! Confirmation code XV2RDM!
country_club_snob Employee ...Oh, here it is. Yep.
michael_scott Oh.
dwight_schrute Thank you.
country_club_snob Employee Uh-huh. Seven nights in our street-view economy single?
michael_scott That's it!
country_club_snob Employee Yeah, we changed it since it was a while back. I do apologize.
michael_scott and Dwight Uh-huh, okay...
country_club_snob Employee Yeah, how may I help you Mr. Scott?
michael_scott Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
country_club_snob Employee There is a cancellation fee for this, sir.
michael_scott Okay, put it on my card.
michael_scott Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?
michael_scott Why hello!
gabe_lewis This is Michael Scott, co-regional manager of this branch.
michael_scott Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
jo_bennett Oh, that's Mrs. Bennett, sweetheart. My husband and I are divorced, but I kept the "Mrs." just to piss off the new wife. Well, let's take a gander around this place.
andy_bernard These sure are pretty dogs...
jo_bennett They love a good crotch.
andy_bernard They sure do.
jo_bennett You should take that as a compliment!
andy_bernard Oh, I do!
jo_bennett Hello.
dwight_schrute Hello.
jo_bennett Do you always stay seated when a lady enters the room?
dwight_schrute I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
jo_bennett I like that.
gabe_lewis This is Accounting.
kevin_malone Hi!
jo_bennett Good-looking group.
gabe_lewis Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
jo_bennett Another couple of heartbreakers. Who is this tall drink of sun tea?
gabe_lewis That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
jo_bennett I thought this guy was the manager?
gabe_lewis Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
jo_bennett Two guys doing one job? We gotta do something about that!
andy_bernard Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.
angela_martin No, no!
kevin_malone What, no candy?
andy_bernard Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem "too eager," so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.
andy_bernard Look alive.
meredith_palmer Ow! Geez, you gave me a paper cut on my throat!
meredith_palmer Yeah, I have this thing about men cutting or threatening to cut my throat. Don't try to cut my throat.
michael_scott Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.
jim_halpert Whoa, whoa.
michael_scott Whoa, whoa!
jim_halpert I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here Michael handles more of the "big-picture" stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...
jo_bennett Yeah. I think I understand.
jim_halpert Alright.
jo_bennett Each of you is doing half a job.
jim_halpert No.
michael_scott And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
jo_bennett This is knucklehead talk. I'm not gonna bite it, you know. You can't give me gravy and tell me it's jelly, because gravy ain't sweet! Is it, Jim?
jim_halpert I don't think so.
jo_bennett Michael?
michael_scott Forget the question...
jo_bennett I think one of you should return to sales, and the other one be manager.
michael_scott I humbly accept the management position.
jim_halpert I... Why would you just say something like that?
michael_scott Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.
jim_halpert Do you even know what that means?
michael_scott Yes.
jo_bennett Well, I'm gonna let this marinate. So you can go.
jim_halpert Um...
jo_bennett You can go on. Shoo!
jo_bennett I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short. I'm a breast cancer survivor, close, personal friends with Nancy Pelosi, and Truman Capote and I slept with three of the same guys. When I was a little girl, I was terrified to fly, and now I have my own pilot's license. I am CEO of Sabre International, and I sell the best damn printers and all-in-one machines Korea can make. Pleased to meet you.
andy_bernard Whoa-oh, traffic jam!
erin_hannon Uh-oh, traffic jam on route three!
andy_bernard Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!
erin_hannon Beep! Twenty people dead in a pile-up!
andy_bernard There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.
erin_hannon Oh, you did? Aw, a bird and a dog!
andy_bernard Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.
erin_hannon You named them?
andy_bernard Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?
erin_hannon Uh, yeah I do remember. Aw, they love each other.
andy_bernard Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.
erin_hannon Wow, it smells really good too.
andy_bernard Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.
erin_hannon Andy, whoa! Thank you very much!
andy_bernard It's got pheromones in it.
jo_bennett Hey!
kevin_malone Hi.
jo_bennett Just choosing seats, not getting married. Chop, chop little onion!
kevin_malone Jo, there's books in my chair.
jo_bennett That's right, darlin', now you're the proud new owner of a Sabre handbook and my autobiography. Now, you all must be in a tizzy. I can see it on your faces, I mean, what's going on now? I mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin? Right? I mean, Sabre? What's that? Some company I've never heard of? Down in Tallahassee? Where is that? Near Mars?
michael_scott No, we know. Texas!
jo_bennett Now Dunder Mifflin has an arm's reach in all these small businesses all over the northeast. Now we're gonna take that arm, and we're gonna start selling printers.
michael_scott I could manage my way around that.
jo_bennett They're the easiest-to-use printers on the market.
michael_scott I will try to manage my excitement!
michael_scott I have been saying the word "manager" a lot, so whenever Jo thinks "manager" she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a pen1s. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a pen1s. And vise-versa.
jo_bennett I think that's it. So we're all good! Thanks ya'll.
dwight_schrute I, uh...
kelly_kapoor Oh my God.
kelly_kapoor I guess Andy likes me. I never thought of him in that way. But, I guess in most romantic comedies, the guy you're supposed to be with is the one you never thought of in that way. You might have even thought he was annoying or possibly homosexual.
pam_beesly So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.
jim_halpert This is way more than I make now.
jim_halpert I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.
jim_halpert Hey, you got a second?
michael_scott Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
jim_halpert Actually, yeah.
michael_scott What?
jim_halpert Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
michael_scott What? Really?
jim_halpert Yeah!
michael_scott Wow!
michael_scott La la la, hello Oscar!
oscar_martinez Michael. Reading.
michael_scott What are you reading?
oscar_martinez The Atlantic.
michael_scott Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
oscar_martinez I should step into sales myself.
michael_scott Why, is there an untapped gay market?
oscar_martinez Sabre has no caps on commissions. He can make a lot more money in sales.
michael_scott ...Where did you get that information.
oscar_martinez Manual.
michael_scott Manuel who?
michael_scott Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.
michael_scott Son of a bitch. Pardon me.
jo_bennett Oh, speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Have a seat!
michael_scott Okay.
jo_bennett Now Jim here is thinking about taking himself out of the running for being manager.
michael_scott Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
jo_bennett Really?
jim_halpert Really.
michael_scott Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.
jo_bennett Well, I think you're both being a little too modest.
jim_halpert No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
michael_scott No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
jim_halpert Why would you do that?
michael_scott I'm turning myself in right now!
jo_bennett You know, Michael, you have more experience in sales and management, so I'm gonna defer to your judgment.
michael_scott Thank you.
jo_bennett I think you will become the salesman, and congratulations! You're gonna be the new manager of this branch!
michael_scott Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
pam_beesly Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!
jim_halpert Mm!
dwight_schrute Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. 89... 88...
dwight_schrute You're twenty minutes late!
ryan_howard Um, I was at another dumpster!
dwight_schrute Just admit you lost track of time.
dwight_schrute Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
ryan_howard Did you see Saw?
dwight_schrute Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
ryan_howard No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
dwight_schrute Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
ryan_howard Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
dwight_schrute I like where you're going with this. Continue.
ryan_howard Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
dwight_schrute I have an old barn!
ryan_howard Yes!
dwight_schrute It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
ryan_howard We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
dwight_schrute Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
ryan_howard Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
dwight_schrute He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
ryan_howard Don't just criticize my idea!
dwight_schrute Think!
ryan_howard You think of something then!
erin_hannon Michael, I'm worried that, uh, not all your toys are gonna fit on your new desk.
michael_scott How is that possible?
erin_hannon Well, in your old office there were all those ledges and extra space.
michael_scott No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
erin_hannon You know, I actually think I should get back to work. Jim asked me to do some stuff, and he's manager.
michael_scott Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? Michael Scott, head of sales.
jim_halpert You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
dwight_schrute The new IT guy. Nick.
ryan_howard Nick.
dwight_schrute I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
ryan_howard Like Frodo!
dwight_schrute Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
ryan_howard Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
dwight_schrute Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
dwight_schrute I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
erin_hannon Who's hungry?
jim_halpert What is that?
erin_hannon It's ants on a log. Michael would always have me bring them in at 2 30 and say "Who's hungry?"
jim_halpert Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
erin_hannon Do you want me to spin you in your chair and make you dizzy?
jim_halpert Why would I wanna do that?
erin_hannon It's a thinking technique. All the top executives do it. It keeps the brain moving, and a spinning brain is a working brain.
jim_halpert For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
erin_hannon Oh sure.
jim_halpert Yeah. Thank you.
erin_hannon Well.
michael_scott It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called "Curves." I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!
kevin_malone Nice!
dwight_schrute You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
michael_scott Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
dwight_schrute It's not really 1992 anymore.
michael_scott Well, okay...
kelly_kapoor You brighten my day with the sound of your voice, you bring so much laughter and love, you're everything to me, and I was so blessed when God sent you here to me.
erin_hannon Geez louise.
kelly_kapoor I know, obsessed with me much?
erin_hannon Well, everyone got one.
kelly_kapoor What did yours say?
erin_hannon Friends are worth sharing a doghouse with.
erin_hannon It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
dwight_schrute Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
nick Uh, yep.
dwight_schrute I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
nick No, I actually don't.
dwight_schrute Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
nick I think that you should call the cops.
dwight_schrute No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
nick I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry, I just can't give out his password like that.
ryan_howard Nick. We could make things very, very difficult for you.
nick Are you... you threatening me?
ryan_howard Threatening you? No.
michael_scott What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?
pam_beesly Michael, stop.
michael_scott No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?
pam_beesly Michael...
michael_scott You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
dwight_schrute Michael, it's Phyllis.
michael_scott No, this is geological.
phyllis_vance I sent an email out to everyone in this area that this might be a side effect to my new allergy medication I'm on.
michael_scott Are you kidding me?
phyllis_vance No.
michael_scott And you guys are okay with this?
dwight_schrute She sent an email, so.
phyllis_vance I did.
andy_bernard It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.
michael_scott Oh my God.
kelly_kapoor Oh! You scared me!
andy_bernard I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.
kelly_kapoor I didn't see you. And you were there all along. Well, I warmed it up for you so, should be good to go.
andy_bernard Cool, thanks.
kelly_kapoor Bye, Andy.
andy_bernard ...That was weird.
meredith_palmer No it ain't. We all saw the Valentine you gave her.
andy_bernard I don't even know what that card said.
meredith_palmer Believe me, if I got that card? We'd be in the bathroom doin' it right... now.
michael_scott Hey.
jim_halpert Hey.
michael_scott You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
jim_halpert Well, the grass is always greener.
michael_scott Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
jim_halpert Well, it's what you wanted.
michael_scott I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
jim_halpert For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
michael_scott We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
jim_halpert Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
michael_scott Lethal Weapon?
jim_halpert That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
jo_bennett You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?
michael_scott What? What I'm saying...
jim_halpert Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
michael_scott And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? See? They love me.
jo_bennett Fine. I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it.
jim_halpert Alright.
michael_scott Alright!
jo_bennett Oh, I gotta take this. Yep. Uh, finish walking my dogs for me. And don't ride 'em. Lotta people try to ride 'em.
andy_bernard Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message "Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way."
phyllis_vance You don't even like us as friends?
andy_bernard Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.
oscar_martinez What are we, five?
andy_bernard "Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog."
kelly_kapoor Um, why did I just receive a mass email from you that said that you don't like me? Do you realize how hard that makes me like you, Andy?
andy_bernard It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.
kelly_kapoor Who?
andy_bernard It's not... Whether or not, you...
kelly_kapoor Who, what?
erin_hannon Yeah, I guess Andy never liked Kelly. How about that?
michael_scott Oh, it smells good in here.
erin_hannon Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
michael_scott Erin, what about my keyboard? Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
erin_hannon Oh!
pam_beesly He looks happy.
jim_halpert Yep.
dwight_schrute Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he what? Michael!
dwight_schrute I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
ryan_howard Jim dug his own grave, but maybe we provided the shovel.
dwight_schrute Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
ryan_howard I would love to. Why not?
dwight_schrute Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
ryan_howard Well, I'm sorry that I don't want farm boy swill like you do, you know.
dwight_schrute It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
ryan_howard I am not interested in anything I have to make myself!
