andy_bernard I'd like to take a solemn moment to remember Jerry in the warehouse who passed away this year. Well, that's all folks. Ski ya later everybody. Thanks for a great season.
oscar_martinez What was that? That was just a normal video with you making vulgar noises.
andy_bernard Well, I worked with what I had, Oscar. Next time do more failure stuff, OK?
jim_halpert Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
andy_bernard Oh that wasn't...that didn't work. That was not the right..
jim_halpert I think I got it right here.
andy_bernard That was not a fail.
all@ Fail! Fail! Fail!...
andy_bernard That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. You're all failing right now. Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail
dwight_schrute Oh, god.
phyllis_vance What's going on?
dwight_schrute Nothing! Nothing is going on. Keep moving please.
stanley_hudson What's he measuring?
dwight_schrute OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
toby_flenderson It's an EMF hotspot.
phyllis_vance Oh my god!
oscar_martinez It stands for electromagnetic field. Generally cause by a concentration of wiring in one area Especially if they're poorly insulated. Dwight.
andy_bernard Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
toby_flenderson You think I have a machine for measuring bee hives?
andy_bernard I was just asking a question, Toby. How are you not murdered every hour?
stanley_hudson Well I'm not getting paid to work in a microwave oven.
dwight_schrute OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
dwight_schrute Oh, the wires need insulation. It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
pam_beesly Thank you.
jim_halpert You got it.
jim_halpert Last week, I finally told Pam about the other job I took in Philly...the side job. And she was so incredibly cool about it. And now I just wanna do something huge for her. Like if we were in some biker bar and she mouthed off to some bikers and they came lumbering over and I was like wham! Gotta go through me first.
nellie_bertram Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
andy_bernard Fine. I will give you one minute.
nellie_bertram Oh, please don't use the hourglass.
andy_bernard You have one minute and your minute has begun and no time will be added at the end, even to accommodate this sentence with all of it's baroque dependent clauses and cascading turns of phrase.
nellie_bertram I'm trying to adopt a baby.
andy_bernard A baby what? A human?!
nellie_bertram And the...agency require a character reference from my employer.
andy_bernard Oh.
nellie_bertram You wouldn't have to do anything. I would write the letter myself and you just simply sign it. So.
andy_bernard Oh, OK. And fall right into your plagiarism entrapment scheme? I don't think so.
nellie_bertram It's not..it's-
andy_bernard And I happen to notice you're down to about thirty seconds here.
nellie_bertram Well then if I could just convince...
andy_bernard And those sand grains are tumbling..
nellie_bertram You.
andy_bernard With fury...
nellie_bertram It's not..it's not
andy_bernard Down the sides..
nellie_bertram Entrapment if I'm..
andy_bernard Of the hourglass..
nellie_bertram ..writing..
andy_bernard Time's up!
nellie_bertram Fine.
andy_bernard Sure. I'll read her letter. And if she tells the truth about how evil and unfit to be a mother she is, then yeah. I'll sign that.
dwight_schrute "Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!" That means you can't make me do squat.
meredith_palmer You better fix this. I already ditched my uterus and I ain't losing any more good parts.
dwight_schrute You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
pam_beesly Week off. That'd be great.
darryl_philbin Hey, if you don't want to teach me Power Point, just say so.
clark I don't want to teach you Power Point.
darryl_philbin Come on! Just show me the Power Point.
clark Just do the tutorial.
darryl_philbin You're the tutorial.
clark No, dude, I'm not. I'm not the tutorial.
darryl_philbin You could be.
clark Mm-mm.
darryl_philbin What are you doing?
jim_halpert Getting my wife a week off from work.
darryl_philbin You popped one kernel.
jim_halpert Awesome, right?
clark So Creed is that dude's step dad?
darryl_philbin Correct.
jim_halpert Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.
dwight_schrute What? Come on.
creed_bratton I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair...
meredith_palmer I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
dwight_schrute I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
jim_halpert "Side effects of EMF include headaches..."
dwight_schrute Had 'em all my life.
jim_halpert "..breast pain..."
dwight_schrute No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
jim_halpert Oof. "Infertility."
dwight_schrute Yeah right.
jim_halpert Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
dwight_schrute Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. What the?
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute Some of these kernels have crowned.
jim_halpert That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god.
dwight_schrute Andy!
jim_halpert I'm gonna drive you up to the lake, give you a whole week on the water. Just you, me and the kids.
pam_beesly Oh, can we stop by that pie stand on the way?
jim_halpert You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also? Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
pam_beesly A dozen different pies? Cause that means rhubarb.
jim_halpert Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
pam_beesly Yeah, OK then.
andy_bernard Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
dwight_schrute So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
meredith_palmer Nice job.
dwight_schrute In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
jim_halpert What?
pam_beesly What's this?
andy_bernard Whoa!
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute Bring it in!
dwight_schrute Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
stanley_hudson There are a hundred packs..
oscar_martinez No six after the eight, no....
stanley_hudson Shh!
oscar_martinez Shh!
stanley_hudson Ninety nine cases..yeah.
oscar_martinez Six.
angela_martin Ooh!
pete_miller Oh sorry! Sorry.
angela_martin Oh my god!
erin_hannon Sorry.
meredith_palmer Lose weight.
erin_hannon I'm trying. Sorry.
erin_hannon Oh, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare Pre-Adoption Standard.
nellie_bertram Oh of course, you were adopted.
erin_hannon I wish! No, I um, I made some short lists. I had a couple sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end zone. I don't know what it was. Not loveable maybe? Oh well.
nellie_bertram Listen, I'm really struggling with this form. But as you know the system, you think maybe you could..?
erin_hannon Absolutely. I know exactly what they want to hear. I would love to help.
nellie_bertram Oh thank you so much!
erin_hannon Just don't tell Andy, because..
nellie_bertram He hates me and thinks I'm a monster. Should go back to Loch Ness.
clark Stretch. Alright.
stanley_hudson How many times do you need to take a stroll?
clark I, my legs cramp up! Ok, it's a circulation issue.
stanley_hudson Boy, I will hammer spank your rear.
jim_halpert Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
clark It's a medical thing.
jim_halpert Just...you good?
clark I'm good. I..
jim_halpert I'm so sorry for all of this.
pam_beesly It's OK. You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.
angela_martin I, I need to get to the paper please.
pam_beesly Oh my god! Ah!
jim_halpert I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
pam_beesly You know what? It's fine, it's fine. Let me just...it's fine.
jim_halpert Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. Really? Smirking?
dwight_schrute What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
jim_halpert Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
dwight_schrute It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
jim_halpert Andy!
andy_bernard Yo. Dudeces.
jim_halpert You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
phyllis_vance Oh, I know I'd be more productive.
kevin_malone As would I.
stanley_hudson No question.
dwight_schrute No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
jim_halpert What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy? Phyllis, Kevin &
stanley_hudson Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies! Pies!
andy_bernard Alright! The fat people have spoken! Dwight, get this bus moving.
erin_hannon Yes!
jim_halpert Next stop Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also.
pam_beesly Oh! Yes!
jim_halpert So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
dwight_schrute Get your foot behind the yellow line.
jim_halpert You got it.
erin_hannon Yeah Jim!
darryl_philbin Stop.
clark Come back.
darryl_philbin Too late.
clark Mmm.
all@ Shabooyah, role call. Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call.
pam_beesly My name is Pam.
all@ Yeah!
pam_beesly I like to paint.
all@ Yeah!
pam_beesly You think you're better?
all@ Yeah!
pam_beesly Oh no you ain't!
all@ Role Call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah, role call!
kevin_malone My name is Kevin.
all@ Yeah!
kevin_malone That is my name.
all@ Yeah!
kevin_malone They call me Kevin.
all@ Yeah!
kevin_malone Cause that's my name.
all@ Role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call! Shabooyah, yah yah shabooyah role call!
creed_bratton Thanks. Playing a little hookey from work today....Oh my god.
andy_bernard Dunder Mifflin road trip twenty twelve! Ah OK, now a serious one.
pam_beesly Hey, where's Dwight? He should be a part of this. Has he been acting kinda weird to you lately?
jim_halpert If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
pam_beesly No, I mean he's sulking. That's not like him.
jim_halpert He's just mad that we're all having fun.
pam_beesly Then why isn't he scheming? Or preparing to avenge?
jim_halpert He's fine. He's indestructible.
erin_hannon Always say that a child is placed for adoption, never surrendered. We're not hostages.
nellie_bertram Well, I have considered kidnapping one.
erin_hannon Never say that.
erin_hannon I am so excited thinking about this child you're going to adopt.
nellie_bertram I wish I could just wave a magic wand and make you a parentless five year old again. I would snap you up.
stanley_hudson Next stop pies!
all@ Next stop pies!
kevin_malone Next stop pies!
jim_halpert Let's go driver! Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
kevin_malone At five? That's only twenty minutes from now. The pie shop is thirteen miles away. So at fifty five miles an hour that just gives us five minutes to spare.
angela_martin So wait, when pies are involved you can suddenly do math in your head?
kevin_malone Wh...
oscar_martinez Hold on, Kevin, how much is 19,154 pies divided by 61 pies?
kevin_malone 314 pies.
oscar_martinez What if it were salads?
kevin_malone Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.
dwight_schrute I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
jim_halpert OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
dwight_schrute That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
jim_halpert Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
pam_beesly Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.
jim_halpert Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
all@ No!
dwight_schrute Stop ordering me around, Jim!
jim_halpert What do we want?!
all@ Pies!
jim_halpert When do we want it?!
all@ Pies!
dwight_schrute OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
jim_halpert That's impossible. Dwight!
meredith_palmer Oh my!
jim_halpert What are you doing?
meredith_palmer Dwight, what the hell?
oscar_martinez Dwight!
clark What?
kevin_malone Well now I don't even feel like pie. Wait...no it's back.
phyllis_vance Just drive away. Just..
pam_beesly Phyllis! That's not safe.
kevin_malone Guys, we only have eighteen minutes left. At sixty one miles an hour we're just gonna barely make it.
pam_beesly Go up and check on him. He's upset.
jim_halpert You know he's doing all this on purpose.
pam_beesly Please? Just make sure he's OK?
stanley_hudson Hurry it up for god's sake. They're gonna be out of banana cream!
andy_bernard Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!
meredith_palmer What?
jim_halpert Dwight? Why are you such a jerk? I am trying to do something for my wife and you keep derailing-
dwight_schrute I'm barren, Jim.
jim_halpert What?
dwight_schrute My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
jim_halpert Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
dwight_schrute You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
jim_halpert No.
dwight_schrute That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done.
jim_halpert I'll take it.
nellie_bertram Andy?
andy_bernard Who is it?
nellie_bertram Um, is this a good time?
andy_bernard Yeah. Perfect time. I'm right in the middle of a rooftop crisis. Fine, let me read it. What do we have here? Uh, ok, blah blah blah blah blah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, you've made this very easy for me. It's unsignable.
nellie_bertram Oh, why, is there something?
andy_bernard It's inaccurate, dishonest and...in a word? Dongwater.
nellie_bertram Ah well, perhaps I could rewrite some of the-
andy_bernard Here's the thing, you asked me to do you a favor? I did it. I read it. Thank you very much to me for my time. Good luck with your impossible dream.
nellie_bertram Alright then.
jim_halpert Dwight, sometimes it takes couples years to get pregnant.
dwight_schrute Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
jim_halpert That doesn't matter.
dwight_schrute What position did you use to conceive?
jim_halpert Ok...that's not...
dwight_schrute Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
andy_bernard British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
pete_miller I don't think that's Nelly.
andy_bernard What?
nellie_bertram Oh, oh no, no. Look, it's alright. It really isn't your fault. No, no. Look, it's...you were so kind. And it isn't anything to do with you.
jim_halpert Did you ever think that because you own the building, everyone in it, we're all kinda like your children?
dwight_schrute You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
jim_halpert Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
dwight_schrute Bildenkinder.
jim_halpert OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
pam_beesly Oh! Hey! How'd it go?
jim_halpert It's pretty good actually.
pam_beesly Yeah?
jim_halpert We bonded. We got to-
oscar_martinez Whoa! Whoa! Dwight!
dwight_schrute When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
pam_beesly You feel OK now?
dwight_schrute Oh, better than OK. You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
pam_beesly Well, actually, rhubarb is-
jim_halpert Don't..
pam_beesly the one pie that I don't.
jim_halpert Don't..
dwight_schrute Everybody! Hang on!
angela_martin Oh!
jim_halpert Pie! Pie! Pie!
all@ Pie! Pie! Pie! Pie!
nellie_bertram Oh.
andy_bernard I changed my mind.
nellie_bertram Oh, you signed it?
andy_bernard Yeah. Not as is, obviously. Made a couple changes. Added some sentences at the end. Trust me it needed it. Well, yeah, whatever. So.
nellie_bertram "She's tough in business, but tender with the people she cares about. She'll make a wonderful mother to any child who can overlook weird accents."
kevin_malone I insult you, Oscar.
oscar_martinez What?
kevin_malone I insult you! To your face!
oscar_martinez I don't know what you're talking about.
kevin_malone Then why don't you do something about it?
oscar_martinez Kevin, are you trying to get me to hit you? In the face with my pie?
kevin_malone You don't have the guts. You stupid, dumb, doo doo face! Yes!
pam_beesly Oh my god. I'm getting so stuffed.
jim_halpert We did it.
pam_beesly You did it.
andy_bernard My name is Andy!
all@ Yeah.
andy_bernard I don't do drugs!
all@ Yeah.
andy_bernard Now check the style!
all@ Yeah.
andy_bernard Of Flatt & Scruggs!
all@ Yeah.
pam_beesly Role call.
phyllis_vance Role call.
oscar_martinez Role call.
creed_bratton What?
