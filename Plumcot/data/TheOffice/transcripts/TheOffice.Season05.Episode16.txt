salesman Salesman Hi.
pam_beesly Good morning, can I help you?
salesman Salesman Yes, I'm from Techstar about a new phone system for you. I was wondering if I could talk to Michael Scott.
pam_beesly I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
salesman Salesman Really? He's never around when I come by.
pam_beesly Shoot.
pam_beesly They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job. But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. Vending machine.
salesman Salesman How about I make an appointment to come back? That way, I know he'll be here.
pam_beesly That is a great idea.
salesman Salesman Great.
pam_beesly Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
jim_halpert Michael Scott, manager. Hi, how are ya?
pam_beesly There he is!
salesman Salesman Oh, hi! Great.
jim_halpert Nice to meet you, yeah. Whew! I can assure you we don't need a new system though. Happy with ours.
michael_scott Hello, may I help you?
jim_halpert Jimbo!
michael_scott ...Jim.
jim_halpert Ayyyy!
michael_scott Ayyyy!
pam_beesly Ayyyy!
michael_scott Ayyyy!
jim_halpert Ayyyy!
dwight_schrute Ayyyy!
jim_halpert Pam, Michael and Dwight Ayyyy!
salesman Salesman Ok. I'm, uh, I'll be going.
jim_halpert Pam, Michael and Dwight Ayyyy!
michael_scott What was that?
pam_beesly That was funny.
michael_scott That was funny. Let's go do it to somebody else. Ayyyy!
michael_scott Oh, look at that. Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year. You doin OK, bud?
kevin_malone I miss Stacy.
michael_scott Yeah, I hear ya. It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you're hurting...
kevin_malone I can't even imagine.
pam_beesly This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
jim_halpert You're only engaged once. Well present company excluded, but.
pam_beesly Really, Jim? On Cupid's birthday?
jim_halpert Yeah. She's fine.
kelly_kapoor So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer. Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
michael_scott Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here. They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.
michael_scott Just about everyone in this office is single right now. Including me. And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain. Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
michael_scott Pam, really, they're back?
pam_beesly I can't see them when they're on the floor
jim_halpert They're for her to look at, Michael.
michael_scott Can I have a word with you, Jim?
jim_halpert Yes, let's have a word.
michael_scott Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
jim_halpert Oh, I'm sorry.
michael_scott Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
jim_halpert I understand that.
dwight_schrute So sexy it becomes hostile.
michael_scott Mm-hmm.
jim_halpert Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
michael_scott Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
jim_halpert We do.
michael_scott --that none of us can be a part of--
pam_beesly You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
michael_scott --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
jim_halpert That sounds fun.
michael_scott So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
dwight_schrute Yeah, deal with it Pam!
michael_scott So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
dwight_schrute Having trouble finding a vein?
nurse Drive Worker Yup, a little.
dwight_schrute How about now?
dwight_schrute I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command. Also, I can retract my pen1s up into itself.
michael_scott I am about to give blood. The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --
nurse Drive Worker You're gonna need to lie down right over here.
michael_scott Okay. Hello.
nurse Girl Hi, I cant talk right now. I'm sorry.
michael_scott Oh, OK.
nurse Girl Whew, I'm really nervous.
michael_scott Yeah, me too.
nurse Girl Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up.
michael_scott Oh, well, that's fine.
nurse Girl Whew, it's better for me just to be quiet, yeah.
michael_scott Yeah, can I point something out to you?
nurse Girl Sure.
michael_scott You're actually talking a lot.
nurse Girl Sorry, it's the other thing I do when I get really nervous.
michael_scott Okay, here we go.
nurse Drive Worker Alright, here we go.
michael_scott Oh, God.
nurse Drive Worker Just relax.
michael_scott Yup, I'm good, whew. Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. Hawaiian blood punch.
nurse Girl Oh, that's gross.
michael_scott Type O-Ocean Spray.
nurse Girl God, stop. Stop it.
phyllis_vance Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me? We'll take all afternoon. Michael is terrified of bob.
pam_beesly What do you think?
jim_halpert I have a lot of work to do this afternoon. Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
pam_beesly We're in.
michael_scott Yick.
nurse Girl What?
michael_scott I looked at the bag.
nurse Girl Ew.
michael_scott I looked straight at the bag.
nurse Girl That's not good.
michael_scott Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?
nurse Girl Well, ok... bags! Alright, that was bad.
michael_scott That was mean.
nurse Girl Um, a hat.
michael_scott A hat.
nurse Girl A hat with no blood in it?
michael_scott That is full of soup.
nurse Girl You're cute.
michael_scott What?
nurse Drive Worker You're done.
michael_scott Oh, already.
nurse Girl Ah, we did it!
michael_scott Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days.
nurse Girl Is he OK?
michael_scott Oh my God, how long was I out?
hank What?
michael_scott Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
nurse Drive Worker Oh. She left.
michael_scott OK. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers. This is hers, she left her glove. I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
nurse Drive Worker I'm sorry sir we can't give out that information.
meredith_palmer What are you doing?
kelly_kapoor Decorating.
meredith_palmer I'll help. Now it's just a stupid baby.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, thanks.
phyllis_vance It is so nice to go out with another couple.
pam_beesly Anything to get out of that office.
phyllis_vance I know
bob_vance I honestly don't know how you can work with that jackass, that other jackass, and that new jackass.
phyllis_vance He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
jim_halpert Oh yeah, I understood.
michael_scott Well here we all are. Alone but together. No flowers for us. Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships. I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan? He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
kelly_kapoor Well, his heart was in the right place.
michael_scott Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random s*x. Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar.
oscar_martinez I don't think so.
michael_scott Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
oscar_martinez I can't.
michael_scott If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure? I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault. OK well, who else?
bob_vance Everyone here who's bowled a 280 please raise your hand.
jim_halpert No way, a 280?
pam_beesly Wow, that's impressive.
phyllis_vance Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
jim_halpert Yikes.
phyllis_vance Come on, Bob. Raise your hand.
jim_halpert No. Bob, no. No!
pam_beesly What?
bob_vance One time. You love bringing up that one time, don't you?
phyllis_vance Yes I do.
pam_beesly Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
jim_halpert That is a lie, that is a lie.
pam_beesly Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
jim_halpert But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
pam_beesly No, you just have little dainty fingers.
bob_vance Oh yeah. You can always model ladies' jewelry.
jim_halpert Nobody asked, Bob!
oscar_martinez Do you risk telling him how you feel? Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
angela_martin Oh God, what did you do? I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
oscar_martinez I was stupid, I told him.
kevin_malone Was he in to you in like a gay way?
michael_scott Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
oscar_martinez He told me he wasn't gay.
michael_scott Really sad.
oscar_martinez I'm not done yet.
michael_scott Oh my God.
kevin_malone A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says "I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City."
michael_scott Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
angela_martin My worst breakup was actually two breakups. Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
oscar_martinez Yeah, Dwight and Andy. We were here.
angela_martin No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio. John Mark and John David.
oscar_martinez Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
angela_martin I guess I have. Huh.
michael_scott Alright who's next? Where's Andy?
oscar_martinez He's on one of his honeymoons.
michael_scott What?
oscar_martinez He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time. I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
kevin_malone My worst breakup was with Stacy. It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said "Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!" and she said that we're done.
michael_scott You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
dwight_schrute You're right. OK everyone, back to work.
michael_scott No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
dwight_schrute A net? a giant net?
michael_scott No. Not a giant net.
dwight_schrute What do you have in mind?
michael_scott I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
dwight_schrute Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
michael_scott Old fashioned meet market --
dwight_schrute No.
michael_scott -- I don't think it is.
dwight_schrute Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
michael_scott These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow." Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
michael_scott Hey.
dwight_schrute Hey. No movement.
michael_scott Ah, still early.
dwight_schrute Eh, its not that early.
michael_scott So how you holding up?
dwight_schrute I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
michael_scott No. No, I meant about being single today.
dwight_schrute Oh. Meh.
michael_scott Meh, exactly. Eh.
dwight_schrute Eh.
michael_scott Oh, here we go.
dwight_schrute Hello.
michael_scott Hello.
dwight_schrute Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? Hi, Dwight.
michael_scott Babe alert! Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
lynn Oh, hi! I'm Lynn.
michael_scott Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
kevin_malone Hello.
lynn Hi.
michael_scott So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev. Where you from?
kevin_malone I'm from here!
michael_scott Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better.
kevin_malone Thank you, Michael.
dwight_schrute I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot, any knot. Go ahead.
Blonde#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode16 I- I- believe you.
dwight_schrute You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
Blonde#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode16 Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses.
dwight_schrute You must use a lot of paper.
Blonde#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode16 Oh God tons of it .
pam_beesly What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
jim_halpert I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
pam_beesly Oh, damn. They've been in there for like ten minutes.
jim_halpert Look at that. Bob ordered hot food.
pam_beesly Yes. And I think they gave him too many fries.
jim_halpert We should help him out.
kevin_malone At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies. It's really cool.
lynn That does sound cool.
kevin_malone I used to go there with my fiance . Before she left me . No, I mean, before I left her . She left me.
kevin_malone I think I blew it. It all happened so fast. So... fast.
michael_scott So, Eric. You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
erik I am.
michael_scott Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair. Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
michael_scott It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so it's not too late.
dwight_schrute ...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
michael_scott No reason.
dwight_schrute Is somebody after you?
oscar_martinez Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
dwight_schrute Hey, it just takes one!
michael_scott Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
kelly_kapoor You met a woman when you were giving blood? That is so romantic.
michael_scott It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic. This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
meredith_palmer She could be your soul mate.
dwight_schrute Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
oscar_martinez It's possible.
kelly_kapoor She could be.
michael_scott Believe me its nothing. I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
kelly_kapoor Aww.
jim_halpert Here they come.
pam_beesly What?
jim_halpert No, just kidding. Seriously though, that's enough.
pam_beesly Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
jim_halpert Oh great, I have to cover?
pam_beesly Do you think they dined and dashed?
jim_halpert Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
pam_beesly I thought we were having a nice time.
jim_halpert We were.
pam_beesly Yeah.
jim_halpert Empty.
pam_beesly Mine too.
jim_halpert Oh boy.
pam_beesly My God.
jim_halpert OK.
nurse Is this the party?
michael_scott Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
bob_vance OK then.
jim_halpert So...
bob_vance Where were we?
phyllis_vance Bowling.
pam_beesly Yep, that, yeah.
bob_vance You didn't eat much there Jimbo.
jim_halpert Oh initially I did.
bob_vance Want some meat?
phyllis_vance Oh sure, a little piece. Ooh, no mushroom though.
bob_vance Forgot.
phyllis_vance Yeah, thank you.
kevin_malone Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more. I get very nervous talking to pretty girls. Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
lynn That's really sweaty.
kevin_malone Are you on email?
lynn Oh, yeah.
kevin_malone Cool. Bye.
lynn Bye, Kevin.
kevin_malone Good Valentine's.
dwight_schrute So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Blonde#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode16 OK.
dwight_schrute OK, what's up?
Blonde#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode16 Look, I'm gonna go...
dwight_schrute Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this. You know maybe sign--
Blonde#unknown#TheOffice.Season05.Episode16 Look, we already have a paper supplier.
dwight_schrute OK. Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot. God!
michael_scott Hey, you don't deserve her.
dwight_schrute Thanks, Michael.
michael_scott Hey, if anybody wants to go...
oscar_martinez We can stay a little longer.
michael_scott Really? Oh, thanks.
kelly_kapoor Michael, it's time.
michael_scott You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
oscar_martinez Come on, we'll all go.
michael_scott OK.
michael_scott Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again. You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all. There's a lot of princesses out there. You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
stanley_hudson Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie? I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
nurse Drive Worker Of course. That's weird. You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using Band-Aids.
stanley_hudson I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just Band-Aids.
phyllis_vance Damn.
