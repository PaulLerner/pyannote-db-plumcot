karen Hey.
jim Hey.
karen Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
jim Oh, umm. kinda hard to explain.
jim I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. "Dwight, at 8 A. M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight. "
dwight No! You'll thank me later.
michael There she is - jan Levinson. First.
jan Michael.
michael . thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
jan Michael.
michael Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
jan Michael.
michael Yes.
jan I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
michael I don't understand.
jan The board voted last night to close your branch.
michael On whom's authority?
jan The board's.
michael What?
jan I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.
michael You're welcome.
jan A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.
michael Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
jan Well, we haven't made final decisions about personnel yet. But you're a severance package person.
michael Oh. Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
jan Well, it's not all about numbers, Michael.
michael Well.
jan It's. it's about talent.
michael Oh, you gotta be. Josh?
jan Our CFO believes that josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.
michael Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
michael It is an outrage, that's all. It's. hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see josh replace these people. Let's see josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.
michael Pictures. Memories. Look at that. They grow up so fast.
dwight Hey stranger.
michael Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
dwight Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
michael Well. we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work . while you still can.
dwight When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, "Something Weird is Going On. " Colon, "What Did jan Say? The michael Scott Story. By michael Scott, with dwight Schrute. "
karen Hey, um. did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is.
jim Really? Wow. that's bad.
andy Um, sorry. the Scranton branch is closing? In your face!
jim Well, I work here now.
andy Mmmm. suck-ah!
pam Are you okay?
michael Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
pam What did jan want?
michael Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so.
pam What can't you tell me?
michael Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
pam What?!
michael What?
pam You just said that we're gonna be gone. ?
michael Do I have any messages?
pam Michael, what's going on?
michael Ok, ok.
michael Listen up, everybody. I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.
toby Michael, uh. we shouldn't be talking about this until all the decisions have been made.
michael You knew about this all along, didn't you?
toby jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.
michael Traitor. You are a traitor.
angela What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?
michael I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
ryan It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail. A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.
angela I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.
kelly If I get to stay and ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.
andy Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!
jim I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because michael sold the building for some magic beans.
stanley I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel. I really couldn't be happier.
pam It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, "Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. " So, maybe that'll stop now.
roy What does that mean?
kevin Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.
roy I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, "You Don't Know What You Got "? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it. in words.
darryl Hey Mike.
michael Darryl. Noble Darryl.
darryl Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.
michael I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
darryl I wasn't.
michael So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and.
darryl Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.
michael Awesome.
michael This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.
michael All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. Let's go.
dwight Yes!
pam Oh, good. you're bringing Dwight.
michael Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
dwight What's the plan?
michael Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake. save the branch.
dwight Can I drive?
michael No. way.
dwight Shotgun!
michael No. There's no one else.
dwight Still.
dwight Thank you very much. Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
michael Okay, okay. Um.
dwight But, do not worry. I have his home address right here.
michael Why?
dwight Christmas card list.
michael You sent him cards? You never met him.
dwight But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
jim Hey, do you have a second?
josh Sure, what's up?
jim I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
josh I honestly don't. I don't know.
jim Okay, so is it like sales or. accountants?
josh You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.
jim What does that mean?
jan Hi.
josh Jan, hey.
jan Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?
ryan I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.
ryan This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and kelly goes, I think it's for the best.
michael Okay, this is it. This is exactly what michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like "Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person. " It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else. . push;
jan So, josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin , Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.
josh Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.
jan Awesome.
josh Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.
jan Wha. excuse. why not?
josh As of today, I have accepted a senior managment position at Staples.
jan Today?
josh 
jan You leveraged your new position with us into another offer?
josh 
jan Damn it, Josh. This whole restructuring thing was based around keeping you. I.
josh I'm sorry, all right? It's done, it's done.
jan I'm gonna make some calls.
jim Say what you will about michael Scott, but he would never do that.
dwight So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
michael I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
dwight No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
michael All right.
dwight Dum, dum, dum, dum. coming home from work. M
ichael Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
dwight Yes? What is the meaning of this?
michael Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
dwight Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
michael Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
dwight Listen, Scott. we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
michael Stop. stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
dwight Whoa hey, why not?
michael Because he'd be intimidated and I, just. let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
dwight Okay.
michael Don't touch me this time.
dwight Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do. coming home from work.
michael Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
dwight Uh!
jan So. we are still scrambling here. But uh, it looks like Scranton is going to absorb Stamford.
jim Wow.
jan And I know that you just left there a couple of months ago, but we would like to offer you the number two position at that branch.
jim Thank you.
jan Yeah.
jim No, it's just I'm not sure if I um. well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um.
jan Michael.
jim No. No, no. Just um. some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
jan Ah. Well, please think about it. And call me. We will do whatever we can to get you to stay.
jim Okay.
phyllis Hey guys. Uh, I'm trying to organize a little group lunch for everybody since you know, we're never gonna see each other again.
kevin Where are we going?
phyllis I thought maybe DJ's.
kevin How about Cugino's?
angela I don't want to go all the way to Dunmore.
kevin How 'bout Cooper's then?

jan Wha. what's going on here?
phyllis We know the branch is closing; michael told us.
jan Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing. Um, for the time being, it seems that all your jobs are safe.
angela Yes!
kevin Yes!
phyllis Stanley!
pam Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?
jan Well, reasons are not important. Would you just call him, please? Wherever he is. and tell him.
pam Sure, uh, Jan. um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?
jan Back?
pam Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?
jan Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.

pam I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.
ryan Is jim coming back.
pam That's, um. I hadn't thought about it, huh.
ryan I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.
pam Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs. so, good news, right?
ryan Oh, yeah, totally.
kelly Ahhhhh! I'm so happy we don't have to break up now, Ryan! This is the best day of my whole l ife!
karen What you gonna do?
jim I really don't know. How you doing with all this?
karen You know, I'm fine. I'll be better when I know if I have a job.
jim You'd actually move to Scranton?
karen Yeah, if they let me, I think I. I think I would.
jim New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
karen Yeah, you know. I might do that. I, who knows? I. I might do that.
josh Hey Andy!
andy What's up, Josh?
josh I just want to say thanks. Good luck.
andy Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.
michael Anything?
dwight Nothing.
michael What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
dwight Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
michael All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
dwight My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
michael That was hilarious. The foam .
dwight Uh. . my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
michael Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
dwight What were your favorite moments?
michael Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
dwight What about when jan said the branch was closing?
michael God, Dwight!
dwight Well, it doesn't.
kevin Hey Pam, we're going to Poor Richards. Creed's buying shots.
pam No thanks, guys.
kevin All right.

phyllis I'll tell you later.
pam Okay.
roy Crazy day, huh?
pam Yeah.
roy Yeah, man! I'm uh. I'm really glad you're still gonna be working here.
pam Yeah, me too.
pam Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.
jim Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton. it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.
karen Okay, yeah. Maybe I will.
jim Okay.
karen Yeah, I'm happy he said that. I mean, I don't think he's into me or anything, but, I'm kind of into him. So. there you go.
michael What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
dwight 
michael Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
dwight Oh my God!

michael Yeah, baby!
dwight In your face!
michael We did it!
dwight Oh, man.
michael How did we do it?
dwight I don't . have no idea.
michael I don't understand.
toby Well for a minute there, I saw myself selling my house, moving to Costa Rica, learning how to surf. But, Costa Rica will still be there. When I'm 65.
