pam_beesly Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
angela_martin So cute.
oscar_martinez Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
pam_beesly Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
angela_martin News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
pam_beesly Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
angela_martin That is where we disagree.
oscar_martinez Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
pam_beesly No, three-month-old humans don't do that.
angela_martin My Phillip is crawling.
pam_beesly Angela is such a liar!
oscar_martinez It's maddening!
oscar_martinez Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
pam_beesly Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
angela_martin No one said "you must have two"
oscar_martinez Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
angela_martin No thank you.
andy_bernard Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat...am i right?
angela_martin@pam_beesly Unbelievable!
oscar_martinez Un-be-liev-a-ble.
nellie_bertram It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
todd_packer That's great.
dwight_schrute Pretty good.
nellie_bertram Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
dwight_schrute That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
nellie_bertram I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
dwight_schrute Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
jim_halpert Catching butterflies.
dwight_schrute That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
jim_halpert Theater.
dwight_schrute Waste of time.
jim_halpert Dragging.
dwight_schrute That's just a verb.
jim_halpert Dragging sticks.
dwight_schrute Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
nellie_bertram Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just... you three, no.
todd_packer Not good enough
dwight_schrute English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. You're crap. You're wonderful. They're mean, but they're incisive.
nellie_bertram Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7 00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
todd_packer I'll be there at 6 00
cathy_simms Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
jim_halpert 'Talla-nasty', very clever.
cathy_simms Thank you-
gabe_lewis Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' no, no, no, no...
jim_halpert Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
stanley_hudson My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? . Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
andy_bernard Okay, everybody. 5 00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
pam_beesly Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
andy_bernard Say what?
pam_beesly We are good to goooo!
andy_bernard Say what?
pam_beesly We're good to goooo!
angela_martin Stop it.
andy_bernard Say-
angela_martin Stop it.
oscar_martinez Andy.
andy_bernard Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
pam_beesly Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
andy_bernard ...ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
todd_packer Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
nellie_bertram Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
dwight_schrute Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ... What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages.
todd_packer Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
dwight_schrute That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
gabe_lewis What happens if you're the hunchback?
dwight_schrute Oh, you get kicked.
jim_halpert How many buttons do you have?
dwight_schrute 40. Always.
cathy_simms Can I see?
dwight_schrute Sure.
cathy_simms So, I get to kick you now.
dwight_schrute No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
cathy_simms Well, that's how I played it in college.
jim_halpert College rules
dwight_schrute Aah!
todd_packer Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
nellie_bertram Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
todd_packer Thank you.
ryan_howard I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
erin_hannon And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
mary_the_cocktail_waitress Sorry, no waffles.
erin_hannon Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
ryan_howard A waffle?
erin_hannon A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
ryan_howard No.
erin_hannon I'm moving down here, you know.
ryan_howard Oh, no, I didn't know.
erin_hannon I'm young, and I can ... and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
ryan_howard You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
ryan_howard Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? Hey.
erin_hannon Hey.
pam_beesly Watson carpet and tile.
kevin_malone One order.
oscar_martinez Order reference number 00983-126.
phyllis_vance Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
angela_martin Paid.
kelly_kapoor I'm dying!
darryl_philbin Processed.
val And delivered.
kelly_kapoor Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
nellie_bertram I will be right back.
todd_packer I will be here.
dwight_schrute Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
todd_packer Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle.
dwight_schrute Well, saddles... ... sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
todd_packer What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
dwight_schrute If anyone's having s*x with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
andy_bernard Who is ready for dinner? "oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid". No. I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves... A Jamaican feast, mon!
phyllis_vance If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
andy_bernard Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
val Hey.
brandon How you doing, Val?
oscar_martinez Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
brandon Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican.
oscar_martinez Terrific.
darryl_philbin What's up man? I'm Darryl.
brandon Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good?
darryl_philbin Oh yeah.
brandon Must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend.
all@ Whoa.
kevin_malone Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
darryl_philbin I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
val Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
brandon Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up.
val Honey, I am not sleeping with-
andy_bernard Heyyy... let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
brandon Hope you all like goat.
andy_bernard Goat...
nellie_bertram Blow in my ear.
todd_packer Alright.
nellie_bertram Like I'm on the beach.
dwight_schrute Seagull.
nellie_bertram And a wave crashing... a wave crashing.
nellie_bertram Oh, that is lovely.
jim_halpert Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
jim_halpert Hey, how's it going?
cathy_simms Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
jim_halpert Uh... yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
cathy_simms Okay, yeah.
jim_halpert Okay.
cathy_simms Cool... Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
jim_halpert Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in... March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so...
cathy_simms LeBron James.
jim_halpert Yes, nice. Good word association
cathy_simms
nellie_bertram Impressive.
dwight_schrute Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it
andy_bernard Thornwood Wholesalers.
kevin_malone One order.
brandon I read the text you sent to Val, man.
val That's messed up.
angela_martin Is this spicy?
brandon No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so-
andy_bernard I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
brandon At midnight?
andy_bernard ... yeah...
kevin_malone It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery...
kelly_kapoor Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
andy_bernard Thank you.
kelly_kapoor I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
andy_bernard Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
kelly_kapoor No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
jim_halpert Yup, coming. All right.
stanley_hudson My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
jim_halpert We have plenty.
stanley_hudson Oh, hello.
jim_halpert Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
stanley_hudson Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
jim_halpert No, no, no, Stanley.
stanley_hudson mm-hmm.
jim_halpert Stanley. Stanley.
stanley_hudson uh-huh.
jim_halpert Stanley. Uhh... you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
erin_hannon Whoa. the lights are still on.
ryan_howard Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
erin_hannon I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
ryan_howard Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
erin_hannon Hello, waffle iron.
ryan_howard Hello, what do we have here?
erin_hannon Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl...
ryan_howard Right.
erin_hannon ... a measuring cup...
ryan_howard Got that. Get down.
erin_hannon It's the fuzz!
ryan_howard Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
darryl_philbin "I got too much ice cream. You want some?" "Getting' my fry on."
kelly_kapoor Boring.
darryl_philbin Uh, "The moon is huge tonight."
phyllis_vance Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
darryl_philbin That's regular text talk.
brandon You forgot one.
darryl_philbin "You're such a great friend."
brandon With the dots.
darryl_philbin "You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot."
kelly_kapoor Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means "Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
all@ Oh...
brandon See? Yes. Thank you, sister.
val Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
darryl_philbin Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
nellie_bertram You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
dwight_schrute You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy.
jim_halpert I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
dwight_schrute Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no... Freak, I need a favor.
gabe_lewis Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
dwight_schrute I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
gabe_lewis What's in it for GSL?
dwight_schrute You really want Packer as your boss?
gabe_lewis Got it.
dwight_schrute If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
dwight_schrute Where did you see it?
jim_halpert In the bed.
cathy_simms I haven't seen anything.
dwight_schrute We gotta find it before it eggs.
cathy_simms Jeez...
dwight_schrute Describe it.
jim_halpert Brown, shiny, painful bite.
dwight_schrute Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
jim_halpert Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
dwight_schrute Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
jim_halpert So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
dwight_schrute Pshh. That's a bedbug.
jim_halpert Yeah.
dwight_schrute Everything's a joke.
jim_halpert I know.
dwight_schrute Check your hair!
jim_halpert Ow.
dwight_schrute God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
jim_halpert Just check it.
dwight_schrute You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide I am going to generate myself into a human trap. When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing.
jim_halpert Alright.
dwight_schrute Yeah. Cover me!
cathy_simms Is this really nessecary?
jim_halpert He knows what he's doing.
dwight_schrute Let the bedbugs bite!
cathy_simms Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
jim_halpert Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now?
dwight_schrute We wait. Come to papa.
jim_halpert Oh.
jim_halpert I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
dwight_schrute Nope, I wasn't bitten.
jim_halpert Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
dwight_schrute Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
jim_halpert Come on.
dwight_schrute If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
jim_halpert You know what? Maybe they just ate.
dwight_schrute No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
jim_halpert Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
dwight_schrute No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
jim_halpert Is that really how you want to get this job?
dwight_schrute Such a chorus girl.
jim_halpert Okay, Dwight... Dwight... Dwight, Dwight Dwight!... uh...
cathy_simms Is crazy gone?
nellie_bertram Oh!
gabe_lewis They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
dwight_schrute Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey.
cathy_simms Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster... Okay, cool. Thanks... I know, I'm a pig, right?
jim_halpert Hmm? No.
cathy_simms Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
jim_halpert Okay alright. I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
cathy_simms Oh my God, what are you thinking?
jim_halpert um... I mean-
cathy_simms I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?
jim_halpert I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
cathy_simms Can you... without running to the other side of the room all night?
jim_halpert Yes, I can. uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
cathy_simms Okay. I am so cold.
jim_halpert
pam_beesly Hey, Darryl. You okay?
darryl_philbin She's got a boyfriend.
andy_bernard Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
pam_beesly No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
andy_bernard Yeah, but... My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
pam_beesly My husband would tell you to go for it.
ryan_howard Hey.
erin_hannon Hey.
ryan_howard Hey.
erin_hannon Hey.
ryan_howard Hey, this is fun.
erin_hannon A lot of fun.
ryan_howard I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
erin_hannon You should move down here with me.
ryan_howard Yeah?
erin_hannon We could be roommates.
ryan_howard Really?
erin_hannon We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
ryan_howard Yeah.
erin_hannon Maybe in six months-
ryan_howard Six months?... um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
nellie_bertram Put your forehead near mine, and see if you can read my thoughts.
dwight_schrute Okay... Seven, one, one, nine...
nellie_bertram No, no, no, not numbers, no.
dwight_schrute No, okay.
nellie_bertram No.
dwight_schrute Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
nellie_bertram Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
dwight_schrute Wait, the numbers!
nellie_bertram Mm-hmm.
dwight_schrute oh...
nellie_bertram mm-hmm...
dwight_schrute There you go.
nellie_bertram I will see you in seven-
dwight_schrute Seven minutes. ... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. .
dwight_schrute Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
angela_martin 1434-967, paid.
darryl_philbin It has been processed.
val It has been delivered.
pam_beesly That's it, last one.
kelly_kapoor Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
andy_bernard Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee...
phyllis_vance No way.
andy_bernard I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion...
val Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
darryl_philbin Sure.
val Okay, thanks.
darryl_philbin Hey, just so you know, me and you... I don't think that's ridiculous... Dot, dot, dot... dot, dot.
jim_halpert All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
cathy_simms What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
jim_halpert Cathy, go.
dwight_schrute Where's the bug?
jim_halpert Awesome.
dwight_schrute Stand back!
cathy_simms Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
dwight_schrute It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
cathy_simms
jim_halpert Right there!
cathy_simms Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
jim_halpert Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
cathy_simms I can't breathe!
dwight_schrute I think I saw it!
cathy_simms Stop it!
jim_halpert Nice job, I think you got 'em.
dwight_schrute You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
jim_halpert
dwight_schrute Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
jim_halpert Oh yeah? What's the first best?
nellie_bertram Dwight? Hello? Dwight?
jim_halpert Is that Nellie?
dwight_schrute Don't let-shh!
nellie_bertram Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? Dwight? Dwight.
