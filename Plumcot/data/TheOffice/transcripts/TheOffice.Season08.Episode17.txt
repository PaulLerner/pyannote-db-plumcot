dwight_schrute Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
ryan_howard Are you holding this chair?
dwight_schrute Yes.
ryan_howard ‘cause I feel like I'm gonna fall off.
dwight_schrute Yes. Yes.
ryan_howard I'm not wearing the right shoes for this.
dwight_schrute We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
erin_hannon Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
erin_hannon Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It's me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me.
nellie_bertram Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ... what's lower than dirt?
dwight_schrute Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
nellie_bertram Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback.
jim_halpert Which Spice Girl?
nellie_bertram The black one. I never stood a chance.
jim_halpert Okay.
nellie_bertram Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
dwight_schrute Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
todd_packer Packer Yep
dwight_schrute Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing – bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love ‘em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
ryan_howard When people see this presentation, they're gonna in their pants.
dwight_schrute Okay.
jim_halpert Come on, man.
cathy_simms Seriously disgusting.
dwight_schrute Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
cathy_simms Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
dwight_schrute Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
todd_packer Packer Uh...
nellie_bertram Uh... that is excellent.
todd_packer Packer I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player.
dwight_schrute Perfect casting, right?
todd_packer Packer Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
nellie_bertram I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
dwight_schrute Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!
andy_bernard Morning, everyone.
kevin_malone Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
andy_bernard Don't care. Tell me later.
kevin_malone Listen, it's important. You've gotta hear this.
andy_bernard What do you got?
kelly_kapoor Oh, my god!
phyllis_vance Do you have a black eye?
andy_bernard Yes, I do. Phyllis.
kevin_malone I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
andy_bernard What?
kevin_malone It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car.
darryl_philbin Andy, who punched you?
meredith_palmer Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office?
angela_martin Black eye, Meredith.
kelly_kapoor Will someone please explain what's going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it's like my life is buffering.
andy_bernard Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam...
pam_beesly That's true.
andy_bernard They had, uh... weapons.
pam_beesly Weapons.
andy_bernard I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
pam_beesly But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
andy_bernard Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
pam_beesly Thank goodness he was there.
oscar_martinez Good job Andy.
kevin_malone Yeah
andy_bernard I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.
dwight_schrute Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!
single_mom Quit it.
dwight_schrute There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
erin_hannon I was ahead of you!
dwight_schrute Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids.
erin_hannon Come on. I was in line before you.
cathy_simms So you're a blogger right?
blogger Yeah. Blogger.
cathy_simms God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I'm trying to be a good girl for once.
erin_hannon Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing... zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
oscar_martinez How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
andy_bernard No.
angela_martin Yes.
andy_bernard No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?
pam_beesly Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
andy_bernard And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
angela_martin Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
andy_bernard Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
pam_beesly 1-8-5-0-5.
darryl_philbin Guys, guys. That's so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
phyllis_vance Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police.
angela_martin Yes.
andy_bernard Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why... Toby is giving us self defense training.
toby_flenderson Me?
andy_bernard Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
toby_flenderson Yeah, um... I can't believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I'll go put on my cup.
andy_bernard Great.
nellie_bertram Yes!
blogger Okay.
nellie_bertram I wasn't really sure which one of you is Chuck.
jim_halpert Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
blogger Look at that guy. He's got his Sabre phone on, and he's not even using it.
blogger 2 This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.
jim_halpert Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
nellie_bertram Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
dwight_schrute Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing.
dwight_schrute Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
jim_halpert I'm very sorry.
nellie_bertram We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? "Hello. Hi sweetie. It's Jim. I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape."
jim_halpert I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
dwight_schrute You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
dwight_schrute Point it towards the store, idiot!
dwight_schrute You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
dwight_schrute Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
erin_hannon We are closed! Come on.
toby_flenderson Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it.
creed_bratton
meredith_palmer Ow.
toby_flenderson That may have been my fault.
meredith_palmer What the hell, Toby?
toby_flenderson Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. "It's all about the groin."
andy_bernard What if you're being attacked by a ... smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
toby_flenderson I don't think that's very common.
andy_bernard What if you're being attacked by a 4'11" man who is penisless?
oscar_martinez Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
andy_bernard Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
toby_flenderson Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
andy_bernard So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
toby_flenderson It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker. You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
angela_martin Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
toby_flenderson All right, well, let's try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn't everyone stand? Okay, so... you're being attacked. You've got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
all@ One, two.
andy_bernard Take that, kid.
dwight_schrute Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
blogger Blogger Patty Grossman. I'm a woman.
dwight_schrute But you still work for Wired, right?
patty_grossman Yes.
dwight_schrute Good! Okay. Flirt away.
ryan_howard Sabre. It's time to come home.
jim_halpert Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
ryan_howard Yeah, no , Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
dwight_schrute Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
ryan_howard You know what?
dwight_schrute You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
jim_halpert Dwight.
dwight_schrute I'm trying to make him feel important.
ryan_howard God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
dwight_schrute Um... Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
ryan_howard You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
dwight_schrute What's a book?
ryan_howard On my God. You're so embarrassing. My mom would say the best stuff, though.
jim_halpert You can... You can do it Ryan.
ryan_howard And you know that I'm capable of this.
jim_halpert You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
ryan_howard What did you think of the presentation?
jim_halpert I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
ryan_howard Oh! "Fix" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
dwight_schrute Jim, get him a water.
ryan_howard No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
dwight_schrute Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
toby_flenderson Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you're alive.
blogger Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?
andy_bernard I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
tiffany That's him... the guy I hit.
darryl_philbin What?
oscar_martinez You've gotta be kidding me.
kevin_malone Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
oscar_martinez No, Kevin --
blogger What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?
tiffany There. That chubby one.
pam_beesly I just had a baby.
tiffany Yesterday?
pam_beesly Wow.
blogger Apologize.
tiffany Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your "thin" girlfriend.
pam_beesly How ‘bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
blogger You know what? Tiffy's going to college.
andy_bernard Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
blogger God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.
kevin_malone Bye.
kelly_kapoor So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- "How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls."
toby_flenderson There's no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
kelly_kapoor No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
darryl_philbin Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
andy_bernard Oh...
dwight_schrute Have you seen Erin?
stanley_hudson I'm on break.
dwight_schrute Oh God... Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
blogger When's the presentation?
dwight_schrute It's moments away. Just stay here!
ryan_howard Hey Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife? Well, that doesn't make any sense to me.
nellie_bertram How you doing?
ryan_howard Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry. I- I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is...
nellie_bertram Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
erin_hannon Sorry about kicking you out. It's just, we don't want our brand associated with death.
blogger Lady It's okay. I'll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.
erin_hannon You're not married yet?
blogger Lady Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away.
erin_hannon My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we're not really friends.
blogger Lady Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!
erin_hannon Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
blogger Lady Well...
dwight_schrute How long has he been in the bathroom?
jim_halpert About ten minutes.
dwight_schrute Jeez! What's he doing in there?
jim_halpert Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
dwight_schrute Are there any bloggers around?
jim_halpert It's Ryan. "I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home."
nellie_bertram What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here?
dwight_schrute I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
jim_halpert Uh...
nellie_bertram What?
dwight_schrute That's right. Will you just give us a second?
nellie_bertram You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
jim_halpert okay.
nellie_bertram That's....
dwight_schrute Jim --
jim_halpert I'm not doing the Presentation.
dwight_schrute Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim.
jim_halpert Okay, I'll do it.
dwight_schrute Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes.
jim_halpert A costume?
dwight_schrute Of course there's a costume! Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
dwight_schrute Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
jim_halpert I've been in here for 20 seconds.
dwight_schrute Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
jim_halpert I'm not wearing eyeliner.
dwight_schrute You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
jim_halpert Time. Space. Gender. There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. No, that's --
dwight_schrute It's true.
jim_halpert This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain.
dwight_schrute Yep.
jim_halpert When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. I just wanted... to go home. This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
all@ ahhhhhh
dwight_schrute Psst.
jim_halpert Oh.
ryan_howard Sabre... It's time... to come home.
all@
jim_halpert All right. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night!
jim_halpert Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
toby_flenderson Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay? We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
kevin_malone Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
toby_flenderson Okay. Good point...
angela_martin Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
toby_flenderson I don't... I don't...
oscar_martinez With all due respect we know what we're defending against a twelve year old female bully.
kelly_kapoor I was a twelve year old bully.
angela_martin Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
all@ Yeah.
kelly_kapoor Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
angela_martin Thanks.
kelly_kapoor Good. Let's go.
toby_flenderson I don't know if this is gonna help...Uh...
angela_martin Let's go Kelly.
toby_flenderson We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
kelly_kapoor You think you're so pretty! Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
toby_flenderson Okay, this is what's called pre-violent posturing.
kelly_kapoor Take that! Not so pre-violent anymore!
toby_flenderson Okay, I'm at what's called "the decision point."
andy_bernard Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
pam_beesly Oh boy. Oh no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
andy_bernard You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, "Where were you when the girls came?"
andy_bernard Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. I just feel good!
dwight_schrute Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
nellie_bertram Dwight. You're the vice president.
dwight_schrute Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
nellie_bertram
dwight_schrute Okay! Come on!
nellie_bertram aagh!
dwight_schrute Hah! Yah! Boom!
