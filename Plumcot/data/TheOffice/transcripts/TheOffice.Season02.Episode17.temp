michael Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then.
dwight They are either going to say yes. or no.
michael Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
dwight Think it through.
michael Have to think it through. Because if they say no.
jim Can we not?
michael No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
jim Still want that.
michael Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys. creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
creed Ryan!
dwight Fumble! Yaaah!
michael Hey, Dwight.
dwight Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
michael You all right Ryan?
dwight Ryan.
ryan Yeah.
michael Pam!
dwight Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
jim Cugino's pizza.
dwight Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm.
question Do their pizzas play DVDs?
jim dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so.
jim What did I do to deserve this?
pam Are you sad that dwight beat you?
jim No.
pam Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
phyllis Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
pam Oh! I. uh. yeah. Um. I'll uh show them to you later.
phyllis Oh.
jim Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
pam Ok, cool.
pam I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um. just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then. I just. I don't want to offend. Angela. or someone.
michael That's what she said!
dwight Ha! I don't get it.
michael Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
dwight Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
michael Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um. And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
michael speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just. I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
dwight What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very. "
michael That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
dwight When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
dwight I can't do this.
michael That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
dwight Oh, okay.
michael But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
dwight Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
michael Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
dwight I'll try and think of one. When.
michael Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just. try not to be such an idiot.
dwight Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
michael Insult.
pam Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my.
jim Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
jim I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while. and go someplace. not here.
jim Where do I want to go? Um. that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um.
oscar I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
michael But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
dwight Saleswoman has a v*g1n*.
michael It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class.
dwight But I'm right?
michael Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman. is boobs!
dwight Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
michael I do. Both of them.
dwight Could I have a copy of one of them?
michael No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
michael Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
dwight Yeah!
michael Congratulations.
phyllis Unbelievable.
michael You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
dwight That is so great about the bonus!
michael No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
stanley Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she.
phyllis It's unbelievable!
dwight Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
pam Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
dwight Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
stanley Why would this affect our bonuses?
dwight They are unrelated.
kelly Is Brad okay?
dwight He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
oscar What the hell is going on here?
angela Are we out of jobs?
dwight Yes.
kelly This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
michael He's kidding. dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny. and it was just horrible.
stanley Michael?
michael Yeah.
stanley You said we were getting bonuses.
michael All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
stanley Cancel wallpaper.
michael As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can. and did. twice. You saw the plaque, right? All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
pam You mean Toastmasters?
michael Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
pam Yeah, the bride doesn't really do. Have you ever been to a wedding?
jim Can I go?
michael Yes. Good. jim taking the initiative.
jim So. Uh. I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
kevin You should go to Hedonism.
jim What is that?
kevin It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
jim I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
toby Been to Amsterdam.
michael Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
toby To Amsterdam.
jim When did you go there?
toby Umm. After my divorce. Yeah.
jim Really for like how long?
toby Uh, about a week. Er. . um. . maybe a month. I uh can't.
creed Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
jim Where do I want to go?
creed I'd send you to Hong Kong. . push;
creed Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China.
michael Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
dwight Good morning, Vietnam! Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
jim No. We're not.
dwight Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
jim Which means absolutely nothing.
dwight Michael, can you explain?
michael Well, it's mostly made up. So.
michael dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
michael Confidence, Dwight.
jim Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
dwight I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So. no. just leave me alone.
jim Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
dwight Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
jim You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
dwight You did?
jim Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
dwight Yes. I am.
jim The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
dwight Which is?
jim You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
jim Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one . Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
jim Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind.
dwight I'll glance at it.
michael It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
angela The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
dwight Thank you, Angela.
kelly Why'd you pick the V. A. for the reception?
pam Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
ryan You're inviting Jim?
pam Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
michael All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
overhead You all ready for this?
angela I am just feeling under the weather. And. I think that I will go home and rest.
kevin I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
angela Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
speaker Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year, dwight Schrute!
crowd 
michael Dwight, they called your name.
speaker Dwight, how we doing?
dwight No, I can't. I ca.
michael All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. All right!
crowd 
michael Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
kevin I always set it at 69.
pam Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
kelly But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
ryan Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
kelly Oh.
pam Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just.
ryan I know what I said.
michael I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. . And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. michael Winslow, anyone?
michael Car starting. All right, dwight Schrute everyone.
crowd 
michael Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
dwight Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight. I say to you and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
crowd 
dwight WE ARE WARRIORS!
crowd 
dwight Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
crowd 
dwight Yeah. Yes!
oscar I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
jim Maybe. Thanks.
ryan You really think you're going to go?
jim Yeah. I'm definitely going.
ryan Nice. Send me a postcard.
ryan jim has worked at the same place for five years. jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
dwight No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.
crowd 
dwight Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen. and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is.
crowd Together that we prevail!
pam Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
jim I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that. um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
pam That's awesome. Where are you staying?
jim I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but.
pam When are you leaving?
jim I'm. leaving on June 8th.
pam Oh.
jim Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just.
pam Oh yeah. That's too bad.
jim Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
pam It's ok. I got it.
jim Alright.
dwight Ok, thanks. There you are. What happened?
michael I got thirsty. How'd it go?
dwight It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
michael You would not believe what happened here.
dwight What? Something happened?
michael Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
dwight Weird.
michael Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one. ' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you. '
dwight Con artist.
michael She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID. ' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
michael dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
