rolando Dunder Mifflin, this is Rolando. Oh yes, she's been expecting your call.
karen Yeah.
rolando Karen? He's on line one.
karen Thanks Ro. Hey, we finally connected. How's Scranton?
karen I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin Utica branch. Turns out it's a pretty easy gig when your boss isn't an idiot and your boyfriend's not in love with somebody else.
karen Look, all I'm saying is it would be a great opportunity, and we'd love to have you come aboard. So think about it, okay? Okay, bye.
karen Look, for the record, a certain Scranton salesman approached me, okay?
michael This is perfect.
dwight He looks like your twin.
michael This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
dwight I will know.
michael But, you will not tell anyone.
dwight I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.
michael Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl. Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
stanley I don't understand why sleeping at your desk is better than you not being here.
michael Just go out, and come back in.
stanley I got an offer from Utica for more money, and I'm going to take it.
michael What?
michael Hey everyone, can I have your attention please? I just thought you all should know that stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.
all 
michael No, no, no, no, no-no, no no. You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing. Clearly, karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her.
jim Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
michael Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take stanley from us?
stanley I think it's because of my sales record.
michael That could not possibly be it.
michael You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office. stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary. The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes. I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.
michael How can I get you to stay?
stanley Money.
michael Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so. Tell me why you're really leaving.
stanley Money.
michael Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-
stanley Money.
michael Pssh, kay.
pam Oscar, did you bring it?
oscar To be Edwardian. His best work.
pam Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.
oscar Sure thing Pam, can't wait.
pam Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club. We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way. Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful. There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed. It's very exclusive.
oscar Besides having s*x with men, I would say that the Finer Things Club is the gayest thing about me.
jim So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?
pam Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.
jim Oscar?
pam Some people.
karen Hello?
michael Fillipellers, how's it hanging?
karen Michael.
michael To the left?
karen Listen, I-
michael To the right?
karen I'm-
michael Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
karen You called me.
michael Yes, listen, um. You cannot tear stanley from his family like this.
karen I'm pretty sure his family's coming with him.
michael No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.
karen Toby's not a salesperson.
michael You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming. You know, I can't do it, toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um. Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
karen Oooh. Good-bye Michael.
michael Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one?
pam I have ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.
michael Hi Ben, michael Scott.
ben Hi Michael.
michael I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
ben Aren't you the guy that hit the woman with your car?
pam 
michael Get out. Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
ben Everyone says Scranton branch is worse than Camden. Didn't everyone from Stanford quit, like immediately?
michael No, I fired them, and your next. . So what do you say?
ben Seriously?
michael What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House.
dwight Found him!
michael Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
jim So what are you going to do?
michael What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.
jim Did they?
michael Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
pam It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.
michael That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright? Oh. My. God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words.
jim We just passed the exit for Corcroan.
michael What? What? We did? dwight and
michael Surprise! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
michael Look at his face! Look at his face!
jim What are we doing?
dwight Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
michael What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
dwight Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
michael We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
jim We're going to Utica?
michael Uh-huh.
jim I'm not going to Utica right now.
michael Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim.
jim No.
michael We are going to make karen wish that she had never been dumped by you. michael and
dwight Utica! Utica! Utica! michael and
dwight Utica! Utica!
michael In your face
dwight Yow!
jim I can't believe you guys. I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
michael Are you calling Karen?
jim No, I'm not calling Karen.
dwight He's lying.
michael Yep, get it.
jim What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
dwight Gah-ah-hah-ha!
jim Are you kidding me?
dwight No communication with the outside world Jim.
michael It had to be done, it had to be done.
jim Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so.
dwight Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.
jim Okay.
michael Hey Dwight, he found it.
jim You know what? I'm just going to call a cab from here.
michael Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
jim Alright. Wait, what are you planning on doing?
michael Do you really wanna know?
jim Oh, God.
michael Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
dwight Or real bombs.
michael No, no, not real bombs.
dwight Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
michael Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
jim No.
michael It could be badass. Yeah, it will.
jim No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
dwight Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
jim Are you kidding me? We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
michael Teach her to offer stanley more money.
jim So the deal was, dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume. And a moustache. . push;
michael So, why did you and karen break up? Was it the s*x?
jim What?
michael I can't imagine the s*x being bad, I mean her body is.
jim Okay, you know what?
michael . awesome.
jim Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
michael Okay, I will start. Um, "A. " "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell. Damn it! What do we sell? Um.
jim It doesn't matter.
michael I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
jim Doesn't matter.
michael Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound. The air-conditioning leaking or something?
jim That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
michael What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?
dwight I'm peeing in this empty can.
jim Oh my God!
michael Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
dwight Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
jim Michael, watch the road!
dwight Hey, you're making me spray!
michael I'll kill you man!
jim Michael! Michael, pull over!
michael That is just so disgusting!
jim Pull over, pull over!
dwight I think I cut my pen1s on the lid!
oscar Can you imagine a life where all you have to do is summer in the Italian countryside?
toby I know right? I just want to go, and look at art, and swim in the Adriatic.
pam And spend time with George Emerson. That's what I would do. I mean it's the best male protagonist we've read, right?
andy Totally, I mean, come on, such a free spirit.
oscar What are you doing?
andy Just came to discuss my favorite E. M. Forester novel. Pam, these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious Pam.
pam Uh, I'm sorry Andy, but this is a closed club.
andy The Finer Things Club is the most exclusive club in this office. Naturally, it's where I need to be. The party planning committee is my back up, and Kevin's band is my safety.
andy Fine. I'll just sit here, in the common area, and read my book. Which just happens to be the very same book you're reading.
toby Alright, just know that you're not in the Finer Things Club.
andy Why can't I be in the club?
jim I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
dwight Believe it.
michael Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
jim No, Michael. I'm not leaving the car.
michael Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-
jim Guy's going by. Shh.
michael You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
dwight And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
jim No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
dwight Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
jim Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
dwight Okay, Jim.
jim Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
dwight Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
jim Shut up, you, shut up! This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
pam I think it's interesting how Forster uses Italy to represent sexuality and passion. And that also brought up themes of, uh, you know, fate and coincidence. And Lucy's torn between these two things. She's torn between passion and convention.
kevin Damn it!
pam It just- To be making a case for passion in Edwardian times, I thought was, uh.
oscar Yes.
kevin Damn it!
pam Maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer.
oscar Very brave.
pam Very brave choice also, I thought.
oscar And George, his- his youthfulness. His, um, freedom. Evokes, um, um, feeling, um, to the, um. What are you microwaving!?
phyllis Popcorn.
pam Why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen, Phyllis?
phyllis Someone needs to clean it. It smells like popcorn.
andy So, Stanley, are you really outta here?
stanley Yep, looks that way.
andy I'm gonna miss you man, you've been like an uncle to me. Like a kind old uncle Remus. I wanna stay in touch.
michael We are in a stairwell.
dwight We are climbing some stairs.
dwight I'm breathing heavily.
jim Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
dwight Well.
michael There's a guy, there's a guy.
dwight There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?
michael Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
dwight I can see the security guard's eyes.
jim No, no, don't do anything to them.
dwight I have to do something to his eyes.
dwight The eyes are the groin of the head.
jim Alright, Great Scott, if you found that choking hazard poster, just head on home.
michael We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.
jim Isn't that thing huge?
michael It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
jim No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
michael Aha!
dwight My hip bone!
michael We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! jim leave us.
dwight Don't leave us!
michael Save yourself!
dwight Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
jim Okay! First of all, stop using my name. And second of all-
michael Dwight, you gotta move!
jim Damn it guys!
michael Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
dwight I'm losing control of my bladder.
jim Oh my God, oh my God, karen is back!
dwight Did you say Karen?
michael Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
jim No, I'm not doing that.
michael Just say you wanna get back together.
jim No, I'm not doing that!
michael It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
karen Jim?
jim Hey Karen.
karen Uh, what are you doing here?
jim First of all, hi.
karen What are you doing here?
jim You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. michael wants me to do that from time to time, so.
dwight Do not tell karen about the industrial copier.
jim Copy that.
karen I cried for weeks over that guy, so yeah, seeing him climb out of a PT Cruiser in a ladies warehouse uniform, felt pretty good.
karen Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
dwight Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
karen I'm taking Stanley.
dwight Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
michael Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground.
karen Jim, hang on a second?
jim Yes?
karen So you're still doing this kind of stuff, huh?
jim Yeah, trying to quit though.
karen If you wanted to see me, you could have just called me like an adult.
jim Oh no, I didn't want to see you. Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier. Equal, I'd say it was equal. So, good to see you.
karen 
jim I mean, it's just that- You know, pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see. you.
karen Oh, things are going really well? Are they? They are? That's great, that's so great. I wanna hear more about how happy you are with Pam. Can you tell me more about that? Thank you so much for coming to Utica, and breaking my copier, and telling me how well things are going in your relationship, really, thank you.
jim Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
karen Traffic, yeah. Oh, def- go, go because of traffic, definitely, beat-beat the traffic, mm-hmm.
jim I. will.
michael We tried and we failed. Stanley, you may go. Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place. Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free. Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.
michael Um,
wanted middle aged black man with sass. Big butt, bigger heart. I can't do this.
stanley Michael? A word?
michael Of course.
stanley I changed my mind, I wanna keep this job.
michael Really?
stanley I wasn't really planning on leaving, all I wanted was a raise. How on Earth did michael call my bluff? Is he some sort of secret genius? Sometimes I say crazy things.
jim Hey.
pam I'm so sorry, rolando told me everything. How humiliating. Would it help you to return to another age? A time of refinement, and civility.
jim Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
pam 
andy Oh-oh, come on!
jim Angela's Ashes, top o' the morning to us. Frankie's prose is funnier than a pot of gold, say I.
oscar Okay, did you get it out of your system.
jim Yep. No, I mean I really liked it. I thought was uh, a fun read.
toby Fun?
jim Mm-hmm.
toby Really?
jim Yeah.
toby What was fun about it for you? Was it the death of the twins?
jim No, that wasn't fun.
toby Did you even read it?
jim Of course I read it.
oscar How does it end?
toby Who was the main character?
jim Angela. Nope. The ashes.
pam
