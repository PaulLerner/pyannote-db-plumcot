dwight_schrute Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. Hello?
jim_halpert Hello, this is Dwight.
dwight_schrute Hello? Hello?
jim_halpert Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
dwight_schrute Jim, what are you doing?
jim_halpert And how many would you like?
dwight_schrute Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
jim_halpert Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
dwight_schrute This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
jim_halpert Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.
dwight_schrute K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
jim_halpert Hello, this is Dwight.
pam_beesly Hey, is this Dwight?
jim_halpert Yes it is.
pam_beesly Oh my goodness, you sound sexy.
jim_halpert Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
dwight_schrute Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
pam_beesly Have you?
dwight_schrute Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
pam_beesly Dwight?
dwight_schrute No! Pam, I'm over here!
pam_beesly I'm confused...
dwight_schrute Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
jim_halpert Can't do that. Unsanitary.
dwight_schrute Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. Done.
jim_halpert This is Dwight.
jim_halpert Oh, and I forwarded his desk phone to mine.
jim_halpert Oh, hello Mater. Good news I've married. Tell Fater. Such a nice woman.
dwight_schrute Argh! Ahh!!
michael_scott Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.
toby_flenderson Morning.
michael_scott Mornin'. So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And...
toby_flenderson Good morning, Kelly.
kelly_kapoor I can't believe this is your last day. How do you feel?
toby_flenderson Fine. Good.
kelly_kapoor I feel weird.
michael_scott First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.
angela_martin We have a buttercream cake and a slideshow of Toby.
michael_scott Okay.
angela_martin But so far we only have two pictures of him.
michael_scott Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
pam_beesly Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?
michael_scott If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
angela_martin Michael...
michael_scott Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
angela_martin No. You know-no!
michael_scott Toga!
angela_martin You always do this! We have a nice, modest party planned, and then you come in and demand the world. Let me be clear. There is simply no money for anything other than a cake and to develop a few more slides... although Toby won't be in them.
michael_scott I thought that you might say that.
michael_scott Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. "Michael, buy a motorcycle." So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.
michael_scott I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
pam_beesly So how much antigravity potion do you want?
angela_martin No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
michael_scott Phyllis, can you do this?
phyllis_vance Yes.
pam_beesly Hi, can I help you?
holly_flax Hi. Yes, uh, I'm Holly Flax. I was told to ask for a Mr. Flenderson?
toby_flenderson As part of my last day I'm training the new Human Resources rep in the ways of the company. Again, the company has allotted for this training-one day.
toby_flenderson So this is H.R. This is your desk.
holly_flax I love the view.
toby_flenderson Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
pam_beesly Hey.
jim_halpert Hey... What?
pam_beesly Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.
jim_halpert No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
pam_beesly Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!
jim_halpert Yes! So when do you start?
pam_beesly I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
jim_halpert Wow. Busy morning.
pam_beesly So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...
jim_halpert It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
pam_beesly Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.
jim_halpert See how easy that is?
pam_beesly Ohh...
pam_beesly I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word "perfect" in here!
toby_flenderson Hey, Stanley...
stanley_hudson Hmm?
toby_flenderson I want to introduce you to...
michael_scott Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
dwight_schrute So what do we know about her?
michael_scott Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
dwight_schrute I hate her too.
michael_scott Why do you hate her?
dwight_schrute Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
michael_scott You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
dwight_schrute Would that be such a bad thing?
michael_scott Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
dwight_schrute What?
michael_scott We need to sell her an elevator pass.
dwight_schrute But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa...
michael_scott Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
phyllis_vance Hi. Are there any local companies that rent antigravity machines?
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode14 over speakerphone Antigravity machines?
phyllis_vance That's right. Yeah.
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode14 over speakerphone What do they do exactly?
phyllis_vance They make you feel lighter...
Woman#unknown#TheOffice.Season04.Episode14 over speakerphone Antigravity... Um... Anti...depressants? I could put you through to someone on that.
phyllis_vance Okay.
michael_scott Yeah.
toby_flenderson Hey Michael.
michael_scott Oh, hey, do you still work here?
toby_flenderson I'd like to introduce you to my replacement.
michael_scott Nah.
toby_flenderson Come on.
michael_scott No. I think I will pass.
toby_flenderson Michael Scott, this is Holly.
holly_flax Hi.
michael_scott Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert I'm gonna win.
holly_flax Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
michael_scott Yeah.
holly_flax What did you do to him?
toby_flenderson Nothing.
michael_scott T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
holly_flax Yeah, I know what you mean. I nearly fell asleep when he gave me a tour of the files. Um, well look, I'll let you get back to work, but I-I really look forward to working with you, Mr. Scott.
michael_scott Y-You can-Michael.
michael_scott Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.
creed_bratton The pleasure's all mine.
holly_flax Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
creed_bratton Any time.
holly_flax What do you do here?
creed_bratton ...Excuse me.
creed_bratton What is wrong with this woman? She's asking about stuff that's nobody's business. "What do I do?"... Really, what do I do here? I should've written it down. "Qua" something, uh... qua... quar... quibo, qual...quir-quabity. Quabity assuance! No. No, no, no, no, but I'm getting close.
dwight_schrute Have you been introduced to Kevin?
holly_flax No. Which one's Kevin?
dwight_schrute He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
holly_flax Oh. Good for you guys.
dwight_schrute Yeah.
dwight_schrute Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
dwight_schrute Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin.
holly_flax Hello. Hello. Hi.
kevin_malone Hi.
holly_flax What do you do?
kevin_malone I do the numbers.
holly_flax Oh, good for you.
kevin_malone Do you want a M&M?
holly_flax Oh, no, that is so sweet. But thank you though.
kevin_malone Yeah. I keep them here at my desk so that everybody doesn't take them.
holly_flax Well that is a very safe place for them.
kevin_malone Yeah.
michael_scott Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
holly_flax Oh... Nice, I've never heard that one before actually.
michael_scott I bet.
holly_flax That's good.
michael_scott I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
holly_flax No, no, I...
michael_scott Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
holly_flax Ooh, uh...
michael_scott You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
holly_flax Um... Y-yeah. Okay.
michael_scott All right.
holly_flax Thanks.
michael_scott Yep.
holly_flax Great.
pam_beesly Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.
toby_flenderson You're-you're not in it.
pam_beesly Well I was taking the picture.
toby_flenderson I love it. I love it... I would love a picture of the two of us, to also take to Costa Rica.
pam_beesly Sure, do you have a camera here?
toby_flenderson No, uh... Does anyone have a camera here? No one has a camera here. Uh...
pam_beesly Okay...
toby_flenderson I'm gonna... I'll go get one. Stay.
jim_halpert So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.
ryan_howard Congratulations!
jim_halpert Thanks.
ryan_howard Don't interrupt.
jim_halpert I just-
ryan_howard Congratulations on doing your job. Did you enter the sale on the website?
jim_halpert No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
ryan_howard All right, try to be a team player here, Jim. Log it in the website.
jim_halpert All right, well it already went through, so...
ryan_howard Don't worry about that. Just re-log it.
jim_halpert Hello?
michael_scott Hmm... Jim? I am downloading some N3P...
jim_halpert That's not it.
michael_scott Music...
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott For a CD mix tape...
jim_halpert Close.
michael_scott For Holly.
jim_halpert Mmhmm.
michael_scott And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
jim_halpert What are the two levels?
michael_scott The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"...
jim_halpert Mmhmm.
michael_scott And "I... love you."
jim_halpert Okay. Let's start with the "I love you" level.
michael_scott Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
jim_halpert Yes. You don't love Holly.
michael_scott I think I do.
jim_halpert But you just met her.
michael_scott Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
jim_halpert Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
michael_scott Well, you're not a romantic.
jim_halpert Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
michael_scott Oh really?
jim_halpert Yeah.
michael_scott Like, with who?
jim_halpert We've been through this.
michael_scott Pam?
jim_halpert Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
michael_scott Yeah, you took it too slow.
jim_halpert Well, we're really happy.
michael_scott This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
jim_halpert And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
michael_scott I don't want her to get away.
jim_halpert I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
jim_halpert I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?
phyllis_vance Oh boy. I appreciate your help, but I can't...
jim_halpert Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
phyllis_vance Why would you do that?
jim_halpert Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go.
phyllis_vance Really?
jim_halpert Well we all want a good party, right?
jim_halpert I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!
holly_flax Hey Kevin.
kevin_malone Hi.
holly_flax Do you need some help?
kevin_malone I can't decide what to get.
holly_flax Well, what do you like to eat?
kevin_malone Well I like pretzels, but, I really like chips.
holly_flax Hmm. Well how much money do you have there? Okay, let's see... fifty... Oh, this is a button. Okay. Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay, you have seventy-five cents. So, that means you could get anything up in the top row.
kevin_malone Hmm...
kevin_malone I'm totally gonna bang Holly! She is cute, and helpful, and she really seems into me.
jim_halpert Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere.
holly_flax Damn it!
michael_scott Hello, Holly. Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
holly_flax Oh, I'm trying to adjust the lumbar support on Toby's chair and... that made this up/down lever thing not work, and then I took the whole chair apart, and that... is the story of me on the floor. It's pretty good, right? You know, I'm gonna sell the movie rights.
michael_scott And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you, how you sit like that.
holly_flax Yoga.
michael_scott Sit on floor and put together chair we will. Yo-da. Um...
holly_flax Pass curvy metal piece, you will.
michael_scott So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
holly_flax Ohh, so you can't make my orgy? Kidding!
michael_scott Kidding. Acting!
holly_flax Acting!
michael_scott Acting!
holly_flax Lovitz.
michael_scott Yeah.
michael_scott I did it!
jim_halpert What'd you do?
michael_scott I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
jim_halpert Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
michael_scott It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
jim_halpert Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
michael_scott Whew, oh God. Laying a base. Laying a base...
jim_halpert There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
michael_scott Yeah...
phyllis_vance Hello Angela.
angela_martin Phyllis, you look like you're gonna have a heart attack.
phyllis_vance Can I get a list of your vendors?
angela_martin I shredded it.
phyllis_vance Why would you do that?
angela_martin Gosh, I just don't know. Why do you think?
phyllis_vance Sorry.
toby_flenderson What'd you guys do?
michael_scott Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
toby_flenderson Well, we still have to do the exit interview.
michael_scott Yes we do.
michael_scott I'll let you in on a little secret I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.
toby_flenderson Wow, thanks, Michael, I...
michael_scott Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
holly_flax Hello.
michael_scott Hey! Hi, good to see you.
holly_flax You too.
michael_scott I'm just having a little exit interview.
holly_flax Yeah, I know, that's why I'm here.
michael_scott Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
holly_flax No, no, I'll look at it later. It's part of my job.
michael_scott Okay.
pam_beesly Did you need me to take notes?
toby_flenderson Hi Pam. Stay.
pam_beesly Okay.
michael_scott Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
toby_flenderson I'm Toby.
michael_scott Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
holly_flax Um, I-I brought the binder. Do you wanna take a little look?
michael_scott Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
holly_flax Here you go.
michael_scott Thank you. What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
toby_flenderson This place, um...
michael_scott Well, no no no no no...
toby_flenderson I've got some ideas, I guess...
michael_scott No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
holly_flax Oh, I'd like to hear the answer.
toby_flenderson Well let me see... I would, uh...
michael_scott I'll kill you.
toby_flenderson I guess everything's okay.
toby_flenderson I made it this far, right? What's the point?
pam_beesly Toby, why don't you open your present?
michael_scott Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
toby_flenderson "Suck on this."
michael_scott What the hell is that?
pam_beesly Michael...
michael_scott That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting. Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
dwight_schrute You did.
michael_scott No!
dwight_schrute You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just-
michael_scott Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
pam_beesly So what is your gift?
michael_scott My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
pam_beesly What is it?
michael_scott I am going to give Toby...
pam_beesly Your watch?
michael_scott ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
pam_beesly I just knew.
michael_scott How did you know?
holly_flax Oh that is so sweet.
michael_scott Well... That's my watch.
toby_flenderson Thanks, I'm gonna set it to Costa Rica time.
michael_scott Hey, that's good.
creed_bratton Hey, it's the kid! Look, look, look, look, look! Hey! It's the temp! Look!
dwight_schrute Oh my gosh.
creed_bratton It's the temp!
pam_beesly Is that the police?
dwight_schrute Yes.
creed_bratton Mm-hmm.
oscar_martinez Well this is what happened uh, Ryan's big project was the website... which wasn't doing so well. So Ryan, to give the impression of sales, recorded them twice once as office sales, once as website sales. Which is what we refer to in the business as "misleading the shareholders." Another good term is "fraud." The real crime, I think, was the beard.
michael_scott Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.
kelly_kapoor I cannot wait to visit Ryan in prison. I'm gonna wear my hottest track suit, and get my hair done, and then be like, "Hi Ryan." And then all the other prisoners are gonna be like, "Damn! Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend. Ooh, I would never have treated her so bad when I was outside of prison."
jim_halpert Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?
pam_beesly Absolutely.
jim_halpert Right to voicemail. Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck!
holly_flax What's protocol on this?
toby_flenderson I normally do nothing, I guess. No, you shouldn't-
holly_flax Michael, are you okay?
michael_scott I'm just worried about my friend.
holly_flax Oh, of course you are.
michael_scott Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
holly_flax No, hey.
michael_scott I'm cool.
holly_flax Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
michael_scott Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.
kevin_malone Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
phyllis_vance Kevin, take your shoes off first!
michael_scott No antigravity machine, huh?
phyllis_vance Sorry, Michael, I don't think they're real.
michael_scott Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
pam_beesly Wow. Look at our parking lot.
jim_halpert Yeah, who'd have thought?
pam_beesly Is Jim gonna propose tonight? He is, isn't he? No, he's not... Is he?
holly_flax Oh, it was a pretty good company, but I just couldn't see a future there. They kept hiring from the outside. It was easy to get in but impossible to rise up.
michael_scott That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
holly_flax I think it's really cool you hired Kevin.
michael_scott Thanks.
dwight_schrute You have it?
meredith_palmer Almost.
dwight_schrute Okay, here we go. Here we go. Put it in.
michael_scott I like, uh...
holly_flax That-That's my car.
michael_scott Hey. What are you doing?
dwight_schrute Mose!
michael_scott What the hell is going on here?!
dwight_schrute N-nothing you need to know the details of.
michael_scott There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
dwight_schrute N-no there's not.
michael_scott Why did you do that?
dwight_schrute It was playful hazing.
michael_scott No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best. Take care of that, all right?
dwight_schrute It's not rabid.
michael_scott Shh...
meredith_palmer Thanks for bringing that up.
dwight_schrute Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
michael_scott I'm really sorry.
holly_flax Michael, thank you so much for saying that. I feel so welcome here.
michael_scott Yeah...
holly_flax I just... Um, excuse me.
michael_scott Did you see that! Did you see it? Did you see what... wow-wee! Uh, well, Jan didn't believe in showing affection, so... sometimes I don't know how to react when a girl touches me. Oh... I like it!
bob_vance Refrigeration guy Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!
phyllis_vance Hey, Kev, I need you to do me a solid and go buy some more barbeque sauce. Okay.
holly_flax Cool! You drive your own car?
kevin_malone Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
holly_flax Yep. Just like you.
kevin_malone Okay, bye.
holly_flax Bye. Kevin, I'm really proud of you.
michael_scott Alright! Let's hear it for Darryl and his band. You know what? Let's also give a shout-out to Phyllis for this awesome party, huh?
pam_beesly Yay, Phyllis!
michael_scott Probably the best one that we have ever had, right? But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
pam_beesly Song parody writer.
michael_scott I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven."
jim_halpert Classic.
michael_scott Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart."
jim_halpert Not my favorite, but...
pam_beesly I like that one.
jim_halpert It's not my favorite...
pam_beesly I like that one.
michael_scott I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby. Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?
darryl_philbin Yeah.
michael_scott It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
pam_beesly I'm gonna to miss Toby. He has a nice, calming presence in the office.
michael_scott Goodbye Toby, it's been nice. Hope you find your paradise...
pam_beesly Don't tell him I said this, but I always thought he was kinda cute.
michael_scott Come tomorrow, feel no pain! Feel no pain! Toby! Toby! Tobee-yy! Toby's goin' away! See ya! He's outta here! See ya! He's outta here! Ohh! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Toby! Goodbye Tooo-by!
holly_flax Not bad.
michael_scott Oh, hey. Thanks.
holly_flax Someday I would love to hear "Beers in Heaven."
michael_scott Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual. Sorry. Kevin. Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
kevin_malone Yeah, Michael, I'm at Gerrity's. You have to come down here.
michael_scott Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
kevin_malone No, I-I brought my money. Michael, there's something that you need to see.
michael_scott What is it?
kevin_malone Just hurry.
holly_flax Is he okay?
michael_scott Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
holly_flax Yeah well, the party, driving to the supermarket... it's a big day for him.
michael_scott Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right? No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
jan_levinson Well it was good to see you.
kevin_malone It was great to see you, Jan.
jan_levinson Yeah, so...
michael_scott O-kay. Hello Jan.
jan_levinson Hello... Michael.
michael_scott Wow, Kevin, really? We're- Sorry. We're in the middle of a party. Is this why you called me down here?
kevin_malone Yeah, Michael, I just uh...
jan_levinson I...
kevin_malone I think you kids have a lot to catch up on.
michael_scott Oh, okay.
kevin_malone Yeah.
michael_scott Thanks, Kevin. Um...
michael_scott Wow. I can't believe it! Look at you! Are you nauseous?
jan_levinson No.
michael_scott Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
jan_levinson Uh, no.
michael_scott Good. Good. Thank God.
jan_levinson I didn't...
michael_scott Cause that's...
jan_levinson ... touch that.
michael_scott Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
jan_levinson Why?
michael_scott Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
jan_levinson Yeah, it did...
michael_scott ... proud.
jan_levinson ... happen when...
michael_scott Um...
jan_levinson ... we were together. That's true. And-but, you... are not... uh, you're not the dad.
michael_scott You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
jan_levinson ...Not to. No, I did not. I did not cheat on you. I did not.
michael_scott Well, okay...
jan_levinson Yeah.
michael_scott So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
jan_levinson I went to a sperm bank.
michael_scott You did?
jan_levinson Yuh-huh.
michael_scott When we were going out?
jan_levinson Uh, yeah.
michael_scott W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
jan_levinson I know.
michael_scott You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
jan_levinson No, no no... it's not just any sperm bank. I mean, it's really... this is a really, really great place. It's amazing, actually. I'm gonna bring you the catalogue. You should look through it. It's... and it's-in fact, it's right next to that little breakfast place that you like in the city where you can draw on the tables.
michael_scott IHop.
jan_levinson IHop.
jan_levinson If I was 22, and I had lots of time to have lots of children, then sure, let's let Michael have a shot at one of 'em. But, honestly, I need to make this one count.
jan_levinson Oh, that's really good. I feel so much better. I just needed to get all that out onto the table.
michael_scott I'm glad you told me.
jan_levinson Look, I don't know what you're gonna be doing tomorrow, but I have my Lamaze class in Allentown, and um... you could come. I usually, you know, use a foam noodle instead of a partner...
michael_scott Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
jan_levinson Okay.
michael_scott My whole life, I have known two things I love s*x, and I want to have kids. And I always thought that those two things would go hand in hand, but now, I think it might be one or the other.
pam_beesly Oh look, they're starting.
angela_martin Well, I hope you had fun today, because you're never ever throwing a party again.
