erin They caught the Scranton Stranger, they trapped him in his house.
reporter Police have now surrounded the apartment complex.
michael They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
reporter It is unknown if he is armed with anything.
kevin They should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out.
dwight They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
angela Just say copies, why do you have to drag cats into this.
gabe Okay, while this is interesting we should get back to work. These stand-offs can last a long time. What if it's another Waco.
erin It's pronounced wacko.
jim Some events are so news worthy, so historic, that you have to stop everything to watch. Balloon Boy, michael Jackson's funeral. Things that if you didn't see them live, you wouldn't really care that you didn't see them at all.
kelly Columbia Street in Washington Ave! When is he gonna come out?
andy I bet he's wishing he had a hybrid, right? Sixty miles to the gallon in the city.
kevin No! I bet he's wishing he was strangling someone!
michael Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street! Come on everybody!
michael There it is! I saw it! I saw it! He went right by! You missed it!
michael Grandpa, where were you the day the the Scranton Strangler was caught? Well kiddo, I was there. I was there. And I'll tell you what. You go sell these and buy yourself a nice spaceship.
erin Michael!
michael Walk with me.
erin gabe and I are having a party, and everyone's invited, and it's at his house apartment and we're gonna watch Glee.
michael Glee? What is Glee, some television program? jim I need that thing stat!
jim Okay?
erin Yeah it's a tv show.
michael Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for tv shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
stanley I.
michael Cancel it! Are you still here?
erin Uhh. It's just that it's our first party together so.
michael MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your tv show.
erin Okay, sorry.
michael I'm joking.
erin Wait which one?
michael I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry. I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
erin Good me too!
michael You know who my favorite character is? The invalid. I am coming to your party.
erin I don't know if michael likes gabe that much, but there's this thing on Glee called mash-up, where two things that don't go together, make one great song. Take Gabe, take Michael, you make Gay Mike. Best friends.
kelly No really? Is there time to change this?! That show! Now first they say that Mr. Schu doesn't know anything about choreography, then like three episodes later he's this fantastic choreographer?! Pick a lane people!
kelly And what was with Jesse's sudden turn on Rachel, between Dream-On and Funk. Where the heck did that come from?! Honestly that show, it's just. It's irresponsible.
angela Are you going?
dwight Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
angela I would watch that.
dwight Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
andy You're having a party at Gabe's apartment?
erin Mhmm! I'd love it if you were there.
andy You would?
erin You and michael are always the life of the party!
andy Try and keep me from coming!
erin Why would I keep you from coming?
andy Try and hide it, I will track this party down!
erin Why would I hide it!
michael Kevin!
kevin Hey, you going tonight?
michael Yes, I am. Are you?
kevin Yeah! You gotta go to the boss's party!
michael What? No gabe is. gabe is not the boss.
kevin No he's not the boss.
michael Why did you just say he was the boss?
kevin 'Cause, you're the boss!
michael Yeeee. Guys! Do you consider gabe to be the boss?
erin It's make your own pizza night. Isn't Gabe's place so nice?
michael Uh huh.
erin Look at the size of those wine glasses Michael!
michael Big.
erin Those posters used to be real French ads.
michael All right!
gabe So these are your cheeses, your ham, your sausages, your herbs, and your vegetables. Here's what's been done, so start creating. Some times it helps to think of a part of the world, and.
michael Okay okay okay.
michael gabe likes to entertain a lot, ad he cooks in an oven, and all that jazz. I just have a different life style. They have these bags of vegetables that steam right inside their own bag. So I'll get a few ingredients, sit down in front of the TV, a bag of vegetables, before you know it I'm ready for bed!
michael 
gabe You don't really toss the dough.
michael Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you.
gabe Welcome to my Man Cave! I did my senior year in prog in Japan. Best year of my life.
jim You play?
gabe Oh! I like to play soundscapes. I imagine one instant of a song, expanded to be the size of the universe.
jim You can't even do that.
cece 
pam She's up! Great!
pam Cece, is reverse cycling, which means she sleeps all day and is up all night. Which basically means I'm up all day and I'm up all night. And if it doesn't stop soon, I am going to be up all night.
erin The show's starting. The show's starting! The show's starting! Show's starting!
phyllis Who's that?
kelly Finn.
phyllis Who's that?
kelly Rachel.
phyllis Which one's Glee?
kelly You have to stop.
michael Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!
gabe It's a little loud.
michael Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah! There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
gabe Some of us are trying to have a conversation.
michael Well some of us are trying to have a.
gabe I'll just turn the captions on.
michael Well I will turn up the volume.
gabe That's for the other box.
michael Okay. Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
oscar That one! She's been in a couple episodes of Friday Night.
kelly You know what? I'm so confused. Is this a Glee watching party? Or a Glee pausing party? 'Cause we keep stopping it, to get a history lesson from.
oscar You know what? I didn't read the rules, I didn't know the rules. There, it's on. I didn't read the rule book.
pam Michael? Maybe you should try gong in the other room again. You can have my seat. It's closer to the TV. It'll seem louder.
michael pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
pam You have a gun in your desk?
ryan Hey! Marantz Tubes Sterio. From the 1970's. I respect that. I respect that a lot. Oh hoho. The five Chinese Berilidy Herbs. No kidding. This is powdered seahorse. They say that fifteen Chinese soldiers fought off the entire army of Gangus Kong just using this stuff. You know what they say.
andy No what?
ryan What is this, Samurai wood cuts? Yep. Pretty erotic.
andy Yeah.
michael Better men than gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
dwight Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
pam Maybe I should go.
dwight Kelly. Kev- Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
daryl Take a shot.
andy Oh thanks.
daryl Wow, so much Asia stuff. I wonder if there's a guy in China right now, looking at a bunch of our stuff.
andy Why does erin like Gabe?
daryl andy look, all I know is that if I was a girl, and I had to choose between the tall dude who loved Asia, and the you looking dude who loves sweaters and wearing sweaters. I'd choose you.
andy That's really nice, thank you.
daryl And I'd blow your mind.
andy 
jim 
oscar jim what are you doing?
jim Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
oscar Flip it back please.
jim Okay.
kelly The show's back on, what happened?
ryan We're behind.
oscar Go to the recorded version.
kelly Oh my God what song was that?
erin I wasn't recording it.

kelly What song was it?
erin Wait, why do you have to record it?
oscar This is why Erin! We're living it! Start recording now!
erin Jim.
kelly Okay, they did Blinded by the Light and they did it with an actual blind guy. Was it worth it Jim? 'Cause we missed it! . push;
pam If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
dwight That would be nice wouldn't it?
pam I can't even talk about it.
dwight You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
pam I kind of doubt gabe has suit.
dwight Really? Oh. Then here we are.
erin Michael. gabe is making the pigs in a blanket, and he kind of needs some help so, he was wondering if you could help him.
andy Ladies and gentlemen please welcome, phyllis Vance! Isn't that White Diamonds Maya Smith Taylor?
phyllis You know your perfumes!
andy My nanny used to wear that.
andy I just ate powdered seahorse! I have to admit I did not think it was gonna work, but it is totally working! I feel exactly like a seahorse! Blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub.
erin Look who I found!
michael Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
gabe Let's go ahead and wash our hands.
michael Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
gabe Yep! Waste not right?
michael So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
erin michael knows everything there is to know about snacks,
michael Well.
erin gabe was born in 1982. He was the longest baby in the hospital.
michael He's the longest baby in this room.
erin What's the longest thing you've ever seen? For me it was the tale from Jets.
gabe erin you don't have to.
michael You know what erin you do have to.
gabe Michael! You are making this harder than it has to be.
michael That's what she said.
jim Hey.

dwight I do. But you married my worst enemy.
jim Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
dwight Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
pam Absolutely!
dwight From Jim.

erin Are you alright?
andy No!
dwight Insert it in my mouth.
jim That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
dwight No, try me.
pam Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
dwight I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
jim Okay.
dwight No. Crust first. Okay, now the beer. Beer me Jim. Ssss. Gentle. Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
pam What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
dwight I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
