pam_beesly I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
jim_halpert Bribery. Nice.
pam_beesly Oh, I have more.
michael_scott Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
pam_beesly Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. 'Cause of the...
michael_scott ... Oh, God is that today?
pam_beesly I reminded you last night.
michael_scott Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in "Raw," and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in "Daddy Daycare." both great movies, but, still.
michael_scott Well, I'll be in my office.
pam_beesly Don't you think you should say something?
michael_scott They're cool.
pam_beesly Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
michael_scott Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
jim_halpert and Dwight That's Batman.
michael_scott Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
jim_halpert The ocean.
michael_scott I work with a bunch of nerds.
dwight_schrute Mmm... hello tiny one.
toby_flenderson Come on.
dwight_schrute You are the future!
kevin_malone This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
kevin_malone Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
stanley_hudson Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
michael_scott Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
melissa_hudson I'm in eighth grade.
michael_scott Oh.
stanley_hudson She's in middle school.
michael_scott Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
michael_scott It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
michael_scott They want how many spiral pads?
meredith_palmer Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
michael_scott Okay.
meredith_palmer I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
angela_martin Can you put that down there?
kelly_kapoor Yep.
toby_flenderson Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
sasha_flenderson Do you need any help?
angela_martin No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
toby_flenderson Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
kelly_kapoor Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
angela_martin I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
kelly_kapoor God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
ryan_howard Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
michael_scott Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
pam_beesly Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
abby No thanks.
pam_beesly I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
jim_halpert What are you reading?
abby From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.
jim_halpert Aww, best book?
abby Yeah, but I've read it before.
jim_halpert Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
abby Definitely the Aquarium.
jim_halpert Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
abby Sure.
jim_halpert Really?
abby Mmhmm!
jim_halpert Yesss. And you're Abby, right?
abby Yeah.
jim_halpert I'm Jim. Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
abby Alright.
jim_halpert Let's start with... your mom.
michael_scott Yes. Well... we can... uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?
sasha_flenderson Sasha.
michael_scott Nice to meet you.
sasha_flenderson Ooh!
michael_scott Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? You want to try?
sasha_flenderson Sure.
michael_scott All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!
jim_halpert Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
dwight_schrute There is no way that hurt.
jim_halpert Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
dwight_schrute Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. I don't feel anything. Nothing. You're so weak. Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
jake_palmer Do you have any computer games?
dwight_schrute No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
jake_palmer Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here.
dwight_schrute You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
jake_palmer Whatever, okay?
dwight_schrute You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
jake_palmer That's your name? Mister Poop?
dwight_schrute Schrute. Mister Schrute.
jake_palmer Sure, Mister Poop.
dwight_schrute ... Schrute.
sasha_flenderson Are you Mother Goose?
melissa_hudson I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else.
ryan_howard Wow.
melissa_hudson There's a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there?
ryan_howard No.
melissa_hudson You've never been to Jitters? Ryan, you are so dorky. Gimme your number, so I can text you.
ryan_howard Uhm...
melissa_hudson Come on! You have an email address?
kelly_kapoor ...that I thought you should know ...
stanley_hudson Mmhmm. What?
kelly_kapoor I think something a little fishy is going on.
stanley_hudson A little fishy?
kelly_kapoor Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ...
stanley_hudson That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
ryan_howard Yes, I--
stanley_hudson Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
ryan_howard Okay.
ryan_howard Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
dwight_schrute That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
michael_scott Dwight! Dwight!
dwight_schrute There's a photo...
michael_scott What the hell are you reading to them?
dwight_schrute These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
michael_scott Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
sasha_flenderson What's a Nazi?
michael_scott What's a Nazi?
dwight_schrute Nazi was a fascist movement...
michael_scott Don't!
dwight_schrute ...from the 1930's...
michael_scott Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
dwight_schrute I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
michael_scott Why don't you just leave? Okay?
dwight_schrute ...Okay.
jake_palmer Bye, Mister Poop.
michael_scott Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
The#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode18 Kids I do, I do!
michael_scott Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool.
angela_martin You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities .
michael_scott This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
melissa_hudson So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
michael_scott No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
abby That's not fair.
michael_scott Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
jake_palmer You're just a middleman.
michael_scott I'm not just a middle... man...
melissa_hudson Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?
michael_scott You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
dwight_schrute We have better service than they do!
michael_scott ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
creed_bratton That is correct.
michael_scott Say hi to the kids.
creed_bratton Hi kids.
michael_scott Yaaaaay.
creed_bratton Have you ever seen a foot with four toes?
Kids#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode18 Ewwww!
michael_scott What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
creed_bratton Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
michael_scott No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
michael_scott You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
Kids#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode18 No way.
michael_scott It's true. I did.
melissa_hudson You serious?
jake_palmer Really?
michael_scott I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
abby That doesn't sound like a show.
melissa_hudson What?!
michael_scott It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. Ryan, can you come here a second? I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
ryan_howard Right. Okay.
michael_scott I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
ryan_howard Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
melissa_hudson You know, I can go with him.
michael_scott Oka--
ryan_howard No! I will... go.
michael_scott Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
michael_scott Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
michael_scott I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
michael_scott I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Miss#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode18 Trudy ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in? Let's have some fun!
michael_scott That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
dwight_schrute Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
michael_scott Stop! Stop! Stop! Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
jim_halpert That's pretty funny.
michael_scott Yeah.
edward_r_meow R. Meow ...Recess! Hey, what's your name?
chet_montgomery My name's Chet.
edward_r_meow R. Meow Well hi Chet.
oscar_martinez Is that Chet Montgomery?
michael_scott Uhh, I don't know.
pam_beesly That is!
darryl_philbin Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
edward_r_meow R. Meow What do you want to be when you grow up?
chet_montgomery I want to be on TV!
dwight_schrute And he is on TV now!
michael_scott Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
edward_r_meow R. Meow Okay, next? So, whats your name?
michael_scott Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
edward_r_meow R. Meow Well what's your favorite subject at school?
young_michael_scott Michael Recess.
edward_r_meow R. Meow Ree-cesss. So tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up?
young_michael_scott Michael I want to be married and have a hundred kids so I can have a hundred friends, and no one can say no to being my friend.
edward_r_meow R. Meow Uh, ah... oh, okay! Well uh, nice talking with you, Michael. Uh, back to you Miss Trudy!
Miss#unknown#TheOffice.Season02.Episode18 Trudy Hi everyone, it's one of my favorite times of the day.
michael_scott Coulda sworn there was...
melissa_hudson Did you get married?
michael_scott ...uh, no.
abby Why not?
michael_scott Uh, just never happened.
sasha_flenderson So, do you have any kids?
michael_scott Uh, nope.
jake_palmer Do you have a girlfriend?
michael_scott I do okay.
melissa_hudson Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?
michael_scott Yes.
jake_palmer Even I have a girlfriend.
michael_scott Okay! Alright, okay.
sasha_flenderson So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be.
michael_scott ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
pam_beesly He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
jim_halpert Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
roy_anderson Pam! Pam! I love this guy! Come on!
pam_beesly So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's so nice.
melissa_hudson Who? Terry?
pam_beesly Mmhmm.
melissa_hudson That woman is not my mother. That is my step-mother.
jake_palmer Mister Poop, I have to tell you something.
dwight_schrute Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
jake_palmer You're ugly.
dwight_schrute Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
jake_palmer Meredith!
michael_scott Yeah?
toby_flenderson I think these belong to you.
michael_scott Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
toby_flenderson Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
michael_scott Thank you.
toby_flenderson Is everything okay?
michael_scott You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
toby_flenderson Uh... it's true...
michael_scott Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
toby_flenderson Mmhmm.
michael_scott Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
toby_flenderson Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
michael_scott What about...
toby_flenderson Not Jan.
michael_scott ...Jan. Kay.
toby_flenderson If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
michael_scott ...Or biologically.
toby_flenderson Somehow.
michael_scott Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
toby_flenderson Yes.
michael_scott Oh... kay.
jake_palmer Is it okay if I take one?
pam_beesly Sure.
jake_palmer Thank you.
pam_beesly You're welcome.
jake_palmer Is your job hard?
pam_beesly It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
jake_palmer Yeah!
pam_beesly Really?
jake_palmer Yeah.
pam_beesly Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. Cool huh?
jake_palmer That's so cool, yeah!
pam_beesly Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
jake_palmer That's so awesome!
pam_beesly I know.
michael_scott Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one . Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
kevin_malone Go ahead.
abby Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
jim_halpert Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time?
kevin_malone What're you doing? You never have plans.
jim_halpert Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
kevin_malone Niiice.
michael_scott Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
michael_scott You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
jim_halpert Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
pam_beesly I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer.
michael_scott and Dwight ...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams...
pam_beesly My theory is that...
michael_scott and Dwight ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you...
dwight_schrute And they do, your parents, love you very much.
michael_scott One more time. You...
dwight_schrute The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. They didn't eat the children.
