jim I'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts I packed. The blue one with the stripes.
pam I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
jim Well, yeah, but I'm wondering if it's too blue. Like, am I making a statement with the blueness?
jim I am leaving early today for Philly, because tomorrow is the first day of my new job. So I figure I'd get in at 5
 00, check into a hotel at about 6
 00 so I can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking.
dwight Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
jim So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"?
dwight Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love, " and adelph, meaning "Adolf. " "the city that loves Adolf. " Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
erin Oh. Hey, guys, the Christmas party is today. Merry Christmas everyone!
angela No.
nellie Is It?
erin I mean, it says "X-Mas party, " but I think we all know what that's code for.
kevin So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
angela Oh, right, like I'm responsible 'cause I'm in charge of the party planning committee.
kevin Well, you are the one in charge of it.
angela Don't blame me for something we all forgot.
oscar Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
oscar I didn't realize how many of Angela's opinions I agreed with, until she tried to have my kneecap shattered for sleeping with her husband. She makes a lot of very sound points.
phyllis I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
meredith We're out there sweating our balls off every day, bustin' our balls. We deserve a Christmas party!
nellie Well, then, why don't we just get some liquor and those mini-Cupcakes?
kevin Mini-Cupcakes? As in the mini version of regular cupcakes, which is already a mini version of cake? Honestly, where does it end with you people?
dwight What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
jim Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
kevin No.
angela No!
jim Done, right?
angela No.
stanley No. I want Tropical Christmas.
meredith Topless Christmas.
creed Tapas swiss miss.
creed Spanish tapas, and swiss miss hot cocoa--What's so hard to understand?
dwight Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
phyllis We already said no.
angela No, no, no.
nellie Too weird.
dwight This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
jim I'm not understanding the confusion. Am I the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen, and meet this glenpickle guy?
angela Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
pam I'm on it.
jim Right.
pete I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
erin Wait, German terrorists? That's oddly specific. And I think--I think you mean John McCain.
pete Die hard reference.
erin I haven't seen it.
pete You haven't seen die hard?
erin Mm-Mmm.
pete Why haven't you seen die hard?
erin I don't know, I just haven't.
kevin Come on, you had to have at least seen some of it.
erin No.
kevin "now, i have a machine gun. Ho, ho, ho. "
pete "Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs. "
erin None of this makes any sense to me!
kevin Oh, yeah, and when he takes the gun off his back, and he's like, "Yippie-Ki-Yay, mother--"
pete Actually, he doesn't say that there. He says it earlier when he's on the radio with Hans.
kevin Yes, you are right. Forgive me.
pete Oh, that's okay, bud.
kevin Nope.
pete Common mistake.
kevin No, it's not.
erin Nerd! Do you know every line of the movie?
pete My brother dared me to memorize it, and I did it, and loved doing it.
erin Okay, let's hear it.
pete Hear what?
erin Die hard. Every line. Go.
pete "You don't like flying, do you?"
erin Don't change the subject.
pete No, that's the--
erin Movie is starting.
jim We're thinking of collaborating with Mike Schmidt on some of his charity work.
stanley I love Philly. Dirty town.
darryl Ah-Ha-Ha! Philly! Exciting stuff, man.
jim Whoo!
darryl So you sure you remembered everything for your trip?
jim Yeah, I think so.
darryl Think that through for a sec.
darryl Yeah, Jim's going to philly tomorrow. He said he was gonna take me with him, but that was two months ago. And I haven't heard anything since. I mean, he said that, right?
darryl What else could you possibly be forgetting?
jim Uh--
darryl Things? People?
toby You know who's not gonna get to work on some exciting new startup this year? George Howard Skub, a. k. a. the alleged Scranton strangler, because he's in prison for something he may not have done.
nellie I'm sorry, the--Uh, the Scranton who?
toby The Scranton strangler. George Howard Skub. Haven't I told you about the jury I was on a couple years ago?
nellie Oh, what happened? I mean, if you can talk about it, obviously. Because if you can't, I mean, I understand.
toby I--I could--I could talk about it.
stanley See you next Christmas.
toby I could, sure. Have a seat. I would start at the beginning, but I think I need to go farther back.
pam We're the party planning committee, and we did not get where we are by playing it safe. We got here by being risk takers. And, yeah, Dwight's party is gonna be terrible. Maybe. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's going to be great. And if it's great. I think we all know what that would mean to us.
phyllis Let's do it!
pam Yes! Phyllis!
angela No. I don't want my name attached to this party.
pam What does that even mean? Where would your name appear?
angela Please just take my name off of everything.
oscar Just take her name off of everything.
pam The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
dwight Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
pam Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
dwight Uh-huh.
pam And that is.
dwight Uh, Oh.
pam That there are no rules.
dwight You have never been cooler.
jim Best Christmas ever.
pam You're welcome.
jim Thank you.
dwight And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
meredith Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
dwight That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
pam What is it? Don't touch it.
dwight Somebody's found the hog maw.
pam Oh!
dwight What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
stanley Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
dwight It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
jim Can't wait.
meredith Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
dwight This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
oscar How would anyone even know--
dwight Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
jim I don't know. Is it what you expected?
pam I feel like --dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem.
jim So happy right now.
dwight Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
kevin I wish my car had a bathroom.
pete "Let Heinrich plant the detonators and Theo prepare the vault. After that--"
erin Eh. That wasn't the line. I'm sorry, Pete.
pete That is transcribed by some fan. They make mistakes.
erin I don't know. This looks pretty legit. Oh, my gosh. I just got an email from Andy. That means they hit land.
erin "What up, shorty? We got in last night, sold the boat, went out, got drunk, saw life of pi, got super depressed and introspective. Gonna hang out here a while. Maybe a couple of weeks. Figure this whole life thing out. Maybe see hobbit. Lates. "
pete Hey. Everything okay?
erin So what comes next?
pete Right, um, okay. So he says, uh, "After we call the police, they'll waste hours trying to negotiate--"
erin We should just watch the movie. That makes much more sense.
pete Or we can just sit and talk, though.
erin No. No more talking. It's movie time.
pete I mean, are you sure. Um, yeah, I probably have a copy or two in my car.
erin Oh, great. Great! So we're watching die hard, now. Good! This is a good plan.
pete Okay.
toby Here's the thing about moonlight. It's not sunlight. . push;
kevin I love this hog mama.
phyllis dwight said it's "Hog maw. "
kevin What is maw?!
phyllis It's the lining of the stomach of--
dwight Ohh. Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
jim Yes, he is finally nigh.
dwight I am nigh!
dwight Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was. okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
dwight Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! Ohh. Too much strudel.
jim So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
dwight No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
jim Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
pam And the fear.
dwight Yes, exactly!
phyllis Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
dwight No.
oscar This is a real thing. "Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad gift giver related to other companions of st. Nicholas in the folklore of southwestern Germany. "
angela Huh.
pam Wow.
dwight Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
oscar "His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface. "
stanley Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
dwight Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.
pete Okay, Karl was actually a ballet dancer in real life. Isn't that crazy?
erin Mm.
darryl Jim, that guy. You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy. what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? It's awful.
dwight Take a bowl and pass it down.
phyllis Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
dwight No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
jim Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
dwight No, impish or admirable.
jim Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
dwight I decided earlier.
jim Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
dwight Of course I checked it.
jim But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
dwight I checked it more than once.
jim Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
dwight Impish or admirable.
jim Damn.
dwight phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as. admirable. There you are.
phyllis Oh. What are these?
dwight It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
phyllis I'd rather have the bowl.
dwight You can't have the bowl! oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year . as impish!
oscar Ow! You hit people with that thing?
dwight No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder
jim Ooh.
pam Mouse trap.
dwight In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
jim Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
dwight Stop giggling.
pam Oh, really? Already?
jim Yeah, it's all right.
dwight It's a punishment. Hey, where are you going?
jim I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
dwight But you work tomorrow.
jim Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
dwight But we were gonna break the pig rib.
jim Ooh.
dwight Remember?
jim That's right.
dwight No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
jim Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
dwight Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
jim You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
dwight jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as impish.
jim Ooh! Are you nuts?
dwight I judge you impish!
jim Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
dwight They're not abandoning the party.
jim Just--Just--Hey!
jim That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
dwight Impish!
jim Aah! Ow!
meredith Belsnickel, I gotta run out early too.
jim Oh. what was that? Now I'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work. God. One second. Oh.
pam Well. this is it.
jim I'm probably never gonna see you again.
pam Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.
jim Okay, sorry, sorry.
pam I can't believe this is actually happening.
jim Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.
pam Okay. Good luck. You're gonna be great.
jim I'll call you when I get in.
pam Okay.
jim All right.
pam Love you.
jim Love you.
pam What's going on?
dwight Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight!
phyllis We found some old decorations in the warehouse. oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
angela Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
nellie Oh, it sounds like the party's starting up out there.
toby Yeah. So anyway, the entire jury wants me to vote guilty. But then I did a little research of my own, and forget everything you thought you knew about fingerprinting.
darryl Meredith's a little cute. I'm just realizing. She got, like, a Emma Stone thing.
darryl Boo!
pam For what it's worth, I liked your party better.
dwight Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
pam I don't think anyone thought that.
dwight jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
pam Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.
dwight I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
pam Zero.
dwight Damn It!
darryl I'm gonna tell jim to go himself.
erin Do you think Andy would ever jump off an exploding building tied to a hose for me?
pete Yeah. Definitely. Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
erin I'm still Andy's girlfriend.
pete Oh, yeah, of course. I know.
erin But you can leave your arm.
pam Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?
dwight No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
jim Yep, I did say that.
pam Jim!
jim What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
pam Oh--Oh my god!
jim What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.
dwight Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash!
pam What happened? Did you miss your bus?
jim No. I just missed my wife.
dwight I found it!
jim And I found out that there's a bus at 5
 00 a. m.
dwight Oh! Damn It! jim got the bigger half.
darryl Back for more, huh?
jim Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
darryl You!
jim Oh, hey, man. Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
darryl That's great.
jim Right?
darryl Thanks, man.
jim Hey, of course.
darryl I shall come by at your convenience.
jim Thank you, sir.
darryl Whoo!
jim Go get 'em.
darryl Oh! Whoa!
dwight Very impish.
toby Two dimes, seven nickels--Well, okay, no, that doesn't add up. It was one quarter and--
nellie Shh.
toby What? I was just explaining--
nellie Shh.
toby Why wouldn't it--
nellie Shh.
toby But why?
nellie No. more. talking.
toby Are you gonna kiss me?
nellie Yes.
