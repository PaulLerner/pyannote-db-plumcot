Oscar and Jim team up to combat Pam's efforts to persuade Michael to spend the surplus on chairs and not a new copier. After seeking advice from a higher-up Michael learns that by returning the surplus he will be rewarded. Once again Michael must let down the troops who have perked up since they think Michael will choose to serve them and not himself. Meanwhile, with Dwight's assistance, Andy and Angela plan their wedding which will be held at Shrute Farm.
