Michael gets extremely carried away with a new, imaginative idea; placing promotional 'Golden Tickets' - giving the lucky finder 10% off next shipment - in the paper reams, which backfires spectacularly. Placing all five tickets (which do not say 'Limit One Per Customer') in the SAME ream which goes to their biggest client means a 50% deduction. Corporate - not too pleased by this - is looking for someone to blame, and Michael looks to Dwight to take the fall. Meanwhile, Kevin recieves three different kinds of romantic advice from Pam, Jim and Andy. The only problem is, all three of them seem to be letting their own past experiences cloud their judgement on the situation.
