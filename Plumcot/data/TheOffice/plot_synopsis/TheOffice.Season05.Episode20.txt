The Michael Scott Paper Company gets their start by hiring Ryan who has dyed his hair blond and was working at a bowling alley and Vikram (telemarketer). After picking them up Michael says he has a possible investor and drives them to a nursing home. It turns out the investor was his nana and two of her friends. He gives them a presentation and they turn him down. Afterwards, Vikram leaves the Michael Scott paper company and goes back to be a telemarketer. Michael, Pam, and Ryan go back to Michael's condo and try to find a free office. They do, but in the Dunder Mifflin building in a closet. As that is happening, at the office everyone claims they love soccer to suck up to Charles. Although Jim says he doesn't believe in sucking up he tells Charles he plays soccer. Dwight suggests that Jim and Charles should play a game after work. Charles says that that is a good idea and after work they start a game of soccer with the whole staff.Jim is trying to touch the ball as little as possible and ducks when Charles passes him the ball. The ball soars over Jim's head and hits Phyllis in the face making her swallow a crown.
