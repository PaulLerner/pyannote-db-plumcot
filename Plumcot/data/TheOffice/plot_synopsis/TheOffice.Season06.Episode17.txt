Pam and Jim exploit their upcoming birth to acquire extra sales. Dwight wants to do the same and asks Angela to have a baby with him. Angela is initially excited, but gets annoyed with Dwight making a parenting contract with absurd demands he wants her to agree to.Michael anxiously waits for Pam and Jim's baby to be born; Jim urges Pam to let him take her to the hospital, but Pam would rather wait until midnight like she and Jim wanted to do initially (arriving before midnight means a shorter stay in hospital under the terms of their health insurance). She finds comfort in watching the rest of the office performing absurd activities to distract her from the pain. When Jim reaches his breaking point, Pam reveals that their baby is a girl, which calms Jim's nerves a bit, but then she tells him that her water broke.Since Pam and Kevin have gotten hungry at the same times, they have enjoyed regular meals together, and Kevin prepares her one final "Ultra Feast" before she gives birth. When the contractions appear to become too extreme, Jim, Michael, and Kevin all think it is time for her to go to the hospital. Pam still refuses, and finally breaks down admitting she is too scared to give birth, but Jim assures her that everything will be alright.After reaching 2 minutes in between contractions (5-7 minutes is the suggested time to leave for the hospital), Pam finally acquiesces and Michael drives her and Jim to the hospital, with Dwight "escorting" them. Pam realizes she has forgotten her iPod with her desired birth music on it so they request that Dwight retrieves it from their house, asking that he not "touch anything".
