Michael enlists the help of Andy and Dwight when confronting a pushy insurance salesman, whose pushy sales tactics lead Michael to believe that he might be involved with the mob. Contrary to Dwight's take on the situation, Michael follows Andy's advice and decides to purchase the "mobster's" insurance. Later, Dwight and Andy conceive a plan to convince Michael that the salesman is simply a salesman, so Michael will cancel his insurance purchase and stand up to the salesman. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam are on their honeymoon in Puerto Rico. In Jim's absence, Kevin decides to make himself at home in Jim's office, which results in him inadvertently cancelling Jim's credit card.
